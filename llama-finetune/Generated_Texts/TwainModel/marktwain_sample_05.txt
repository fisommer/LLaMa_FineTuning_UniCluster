She had lived all her life in a state of perfect health, andWe went in, and the place was all lit up with Christmas lights, and the     music was pretty good.  I got up and danced.  Then the preacher got upitself and said he couldn't dance, and we had to sit down and listen tothe sermon.  Then he said he wasn't sure he had ever seen such a     awful bunch of people.
