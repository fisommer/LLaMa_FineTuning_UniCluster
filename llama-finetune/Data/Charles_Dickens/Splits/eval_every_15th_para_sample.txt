"This is a rum game!" said one of the fellows, giving the door a kick,
"it wont open!"

‘There, my dear!’ she said. ‘Now you know the beginning, middle, and
end, and all about it. We won’t mention the subject to one another any
more; neither, of course, will you mention it to anybody else. This is
my grumpy, frumpy story, and we’ll keep it to ourselves, Trot!’

‘Gŏ-lāng!’ cries the cap’en to his company, the horses, and away we go.

"I'm much obleeged to her, I'm sure," said Mr. Peggotty. "Well sir, if
you can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her," nodding at his
sister, "and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of your company."

‘Must I!’

‘No, I don’t,’ replied the old woman gruffly; ‘he’s out o’ town now.’

"Business!" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. "Mankind was my
business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,
forbearance, and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my
trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my
business!"

Rolling up the slip of paper as an instrument to point his speech
with, Mr. Guppy proceeds.

Having delivered himself of which remark with infinite contempt, old
Gruff and Tackleton withdrew.

There was the shadow of a man upon the wall close to her. She started
up, looked round, and with a piercing cry, saw Walter Gay behind her!

It is, personally, neither Smithick, nor Watersby, that I here mention,
nor was I ever acquainted with any man of either of those names, nor do I
think that there has been any one of either of those names in that
Liverpool House for years back.  But, it is in reality the House itself
that I refer to; and a wiser merchant or a truer gentleman never stepped.

Mary and Georgina unite in kindest regard to you, and to Mrs. Knight,
and to your daughters. So do I. And I am ever, my dear Knight,

“And it’s very expensive,” added Mr Dombey.

Next, let me convey to you the intelligence that I resolve to launch
"Miss Manuel," fully confiding in your conviction of the power of the
story. On all business points, Wills will communicate with you. I
purpose beginning its publication in our first September number,
therefore there is no time to be lost.

"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;
for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way from church, and had come
home rampant. "Not coming upon Christmas Day!"

‘Very precious,’ said John.  ‘Very much so.  He generally _is_ asleep,
an’t he?’

‘Mrs. Tibbs! Mrs. Tibbs!’ screamed the woodpecker again.

We have got into an immense difficulty with the people of Newhaven. I
have a strong suspicion that one of our men (who sold there) has been
speculating all this while, and that he must have put front seats in his
pockets, and sold back ones. He denies what the mayor charges, but the
mayor holds on grimly. Dolby set off from Baltimore as soon as we found
out what was amiss, to examine and report; but some new feature of
difficulty must have come out, for this morning he telegraphs from New
York (where he had to sleep last night on his way to Newhaven), that he
is coming back for further consultation with the Chief. It will
certainly hurt us, and will of course be distorted by the papers into
all manner of shapes. My suspicion _may not_ be correct, but I have an
instinctive belief that it is. We shall probably have the old New York
row (and loss) over again, unless I can catch this mayor tripping in an
assertion.

“Then,” resumes Mr Toots, after some contemplative pulling at his pipe,
during which his visage has expressed the most contented reflection,
“what an observant woman my wife is! What sagacity she possesses! What
remarks she makes! It was only last night, when we were sitting in the
enjoyment of connubial bliss—which, upon my word and honour, is a
feeble term to express my feelings in the society of my wife—that she
said how remarkable it was to consider the present position of our
friend Walters. ‘Here,’ observes my wife, ‘he is, released from
sea-going, after that first long voyage with his young bride’—as you
know he was, Mr Sols.”

‘Well, I never saw such people in all my life as you are, for time, up
here!’ Mrs. Nickleby would exclaim in great astonishment; ‘I declare I
never did! I had not the least idea that Nicholas was after his time,
not the smallest. Mr. Nickleby used to say--your poor papa, I am speaking
of, Kate my dear--used to say, that appetite was the best clock in the
world, but you have no appetite, my dear Miss Bray, I wish you had, and
upon my word I really think you ought to take something that would give
you one. I am sure I don’t know, but I have heard that two or three
dozen native lobsters give an appetite, though that comes to the same
thing after all, for I suppose you must have an appetite before you can
take ‘em. If I said lobsters, I meant oysters, but of course it’s all
the same, though really how you came to know about Nicholas--’

MURMURS.

‘Oh, no, Sir,’ replied Mary eagerly. ‘He has only just come home. He is
not going to ask you for any more leave, Sir, he says.’

"Oh, never fear, sir, but I'll be off presently," said he: "my walk's
waitin' for me on the road; I'll overtake it imm_a_diately."

"There's Mr. Dick, too," said Traddles, "has been doing wonders! As soon
as he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep, whom he kept in such
charge as _I_ never saw exceeded, he began to devote himself to Mr.
Wickfield. And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we
have been making, and his real usefulness in extracting, and copying,
and fetching, and carrying, have been quite stimulating to us."

All join in kindest love to your dear sister and all the rest.

“I mean that I made inquiries everywhere about, and, that no living
ears but mine heard either that cry or that howl. So I say they was
both ghosts; though why they came to me, I’ve never made out.”

"No Thoroughfare" is very shortly coming out in Paris, where it is now
in active rehearsal. It is still playing here, but without Fechter, who
has been very ill. The doctor's dismissal of him to Paris, however, and
his getting better there, enables him to get up the play there. He and
Wilkie missed so many pieces of stage-effect here, that, unless I am
quite satisfied with his report, I shall go over and try my
stage-managerial hand at the Vaudeville Theatre. I particularly want the
drugging and attempted robbing in the bedroom scene at the Swiss inn to
be done to the sound of a waterfall rising and falling with the wind.
Although in the very opening of that scene they speak of the waterfall
and listen to it, nobody thought of its mysterious music. I could make
it, with a good stage-carpenter, in an hour.

Conjurer, Dickens as a, 41

First--to get my sister and myself out of the way--there were we
two.  In the drawing of lots, my sister drew her own room, and I
drew Master B.'s.  Next, there was our first cousin John Herschel,
so called after the great astronomer: than whom I suppose a better
man at a telescope does not breathe.  With him, was his wife: a
charming creature to whom he had been married in the previous
spring.  I thought it (under the circumstances) rather imprudent to
bring her, because there is no knowing what even a false alarm may
do at such a time; but I suppose he knew his own business best, and
I must say that if she had been MY wife, I never could have left
her endearing and bright face behind.  They drew the Clock Room.
Alfred Starling, an uncommonly agreeable young fellow of eight-and-
twenty for whom I have the greatest liking, was in the Double Room;
mine, usually, and designated by that name from having a dressing-
room within it, with two large and cumbersome windows, which no
wedges I was ever able to make, would keep from shaking, in any
weather, wind or no wind.  Alfred is a young fellow who pretends to
be "fast" (another word for loose, as I understand the term), but
who is much too good and sensible for that nonsense, and who would
have distinguished himself before now, if his father had not
unfortunately left him a small independence of two hundred a year,
on the strength of which his only occupation in life has been to
spend six.  I am in hopes, however, that his Banker may break, or
that he may enter into some speculation guaranteed to pay twenty
per cent.; for, I am convinced that if he could only be ruined, his
fortune is made.  Belinda Bates, bosom friend of my sister, and a
most intellectual, amiable, and delightful girl, got the Picture
Room.  She has a fine genius for poetry, combined with real
business earnestness, and "goes in"--to use an expression of
Alfred's--for Woman's mission, Woman's rights, Woman's wrongs, and
everything that is woman's with a capital W, or is not and ought to
be, or is and ought not to be.  "Most praiseworthy, my dear, and
Heaven prosper you!" I whispered to her on the first night of my
taking leave of her at the Picture-Room door, "but don't overdo it.
And in respect of the great necessity there is, my darling, for
more employments being within the reach of Woman than our
civilisation has as yet assigned to her, don't fly at the
unfortunate men, even those men who are at first sight in your way,
as if they were the natural oppressors of your sex; for, trust me,
Belinda, they do sometimes spend their wages among wives and
daughters, sisters, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers; and the play
is, really, not ALL Wolf and Red Riding-Hood, but has other parts
in it."  However, I digress.

Page 276, "on" changed to "of" (There's two of you)

She had relieved the faithful fulness of her heart, and modestly said,
raising her eyes appealingly to her new friend's, "I did not mean to say
so much, nor have I ever but once spoken about this before.  But it
seems to set it more right than it was last night.  I said I wished you
had not followed me, sir.  I don't wish it so much now, unless you
should think--indeed I don't wish it at all, unless I should have spoken
so confusedly, that--that you can scarcely understand me, which I am
afraid may be the case."

‘I suppose,’ said the constable, looking round, ‘that no gentleman here
can give evidence as to whether he’s been flush of money of late, Do
you happen to know, Sir?’

‘Yes. Therefore, I call upon you both--as I was about to say when I was
interrupted by my clerk--to find bail.’

We looked into the other little room, and came back to Mrs. Gummidge,
sitting on the locker, whom Mr. Peggotty, putting the light on the
chimney-piece, requested to rise, that he might carry it outside the
door before extinguishing the candle.

‘Professor Pumpkinskull wished to take that opportunity of calling the
attention of the section to a most important and serious point. The
author of the treatise just read had alluded to the prevalent taste for
bears’-grease as a means of promoting the growth of hair, which
undoubtedly was diffused to a very great and (as it appeared to him)
very alarming extent. No gentleman attending that section could fail to
be aware of the fact that the youth of the present age evinced, by
their behaviour in the streets, and at all places of public resort, a
considerable lack of that gallantry and gentlemanly feeling which, in
more ignorant times, had been thought becoming. He wished to know
whether it were possible that a constant outward application of
bears’-grease by the young gentlemen about town had imperceptibly
infused into those unhappy persons something of the nature and quality
of the bear. He shuddered as he threw out the remark; but if this
theory, on inquiry, should prove to be well founded, it would at once
explain a great deal of unpleasant eccentricity of behaviour, which,
without some such discovery, was wholly unaccountable.

I.

It is some years now, since we first conceived a strong veneration for
Clowns, and an intense anxiety to know what they did with themselves
out of pantomime time, and off the stage. As a child, we were
accustomed to pester our relations and friends with questions out of
number concerning these gentry;--whether their appetite for sausages
and such like wares was always the same, and if so, at whose expense
they were maintained; whether they were ever taken up for pilfering
other people's goods, or were forgiven by everybody because it was only
done in fun; how it was they got such beautiful complexions, and where
they lived; and whether they were born Clowns, or gradually turned
into Clowns as they grew up. On these and a thousand other points our
curiosity was insatiable. Nor were our speculations confined to Clowns
alone: they extended to Harlequins, Pantaloons, and Columbines, all of
whom we believed to be real and veritable personages, existing in the
same forms and characters all the year round. How often have we wished
that the Pantaloon were our god-father! and how often thought that to
marry a Columbine would be to attain the highest pitch of all human
felicity!

"Most wonderful woman in the world, Trotwood. Why has _she_ done nothing
to set things right?"

TORQUAY, _Wednesday, Jan. 27th, 1869._

‘Chosen to help you with Mr Lewsome!’ said John. ‘Chosen to help you
with Mr Chuffey!’

"What has ever got your precious father then?" said Mrs. Cratchit. "And
your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by
half an hour."

“It is not,” said Mr. Woodcourt, “his being so much younger or older,
or thinner or fatter, or paler or ruddier, as there being upon his
face such a singular expression. I never saw so remarkable a look in
a young person. One cannot say that it is all anxiety or all
weariness; yet it is both, and like ungrown despair.”

When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah
evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my
business. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in,
and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”

"You recollect the gentleman very well, I dare say, Sam," replied Mr.
Pickwick, "or else you are more unmindful of your old acquaintances
than I think you are. Hush! not a word, Sam; not a syllable. Here he
is."

Having nothing to oppose to this reproof, the man was about to withdraw,
when the visitor who had given occasion to it, probably rendered
impatient by delay, knocked with his knuckles at the chamber-door, and
called out that he had urgent business with Sir John Chester, which
admitted of no delay.

“Yes,” she replied, “they are different beings every hour.”

"No, he's out, or he would have murdered him," replied Noah. "He said he
wanted to--"

‘I do not feel warranted in soliciting my former friend Mr. Copperfield,
or my former friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple, if that
gentleman is still existent and forthcoming, to condescend to meet me,
and renew (so far as may be) our past relations of the olden time. I
confine myself to throwing out the observation, that, at the hour and
place I have indicated, may be found such ruined vestiges as yet

"Late to be traipsing athwart this coomb--hey?" said the engaged man
of fifty.

I assure you, most unaffectedly and cordially, that the dedication of
that book to Mary and _Kate_ (not Catherine) will be a real delight to
me, and to all of us. I know well that you propose it in "affectionate
regard," and value and esteem it, therefore, in a way not easy of
expression.

I want to talk the matter over with you, and wish you would fix your
own time and place--either here or at your house or at the Athenæum,
though this would be the best place, because I have my papers about me.
If you would take a chop with me, for instance, on Tuesday or Wednesday,
I could tell you more in two minutes than in twenty letters, albeit I
have endeavoured to make this as businesslike and stupid as need be.

We drive away together, and I awake from the dream. I believe it at
last. It is my dear, dear, little wife beside me, whom I love so well!

‘What?’ interposed Mr. Weller, with great anxiety. ‘What?’

When the agonised girl had made those final protestations, I had seen her
face, and it was in unison with her distracted heartbroken voice, and it
was very moving.  It certainly did not impress me by any beauty that it
had, and if I ever see it again in another world I shall only know it by
the help of some new sense or intelligence.  But it came to me in my
sleep that night, and I selfishly dismissed it in the most efficient way
I could think of.  I caused some extra care to be taken of her in the
prison, and counsel to be retained for her defence when she was tried at
the Old Bailey; and her sentence was lenient, and her history and conduct
proved that it was right.  In doing the little I did for her, I remember
to have had the kind help of some gentle-hearted functionary to whom I
addressed myself—but what functionary I have long forgotten—who I suppose
was officially present at the Inquest.

"Lord bless my soul!" he exclaimed, "I didn't know they were chops. Why,
a chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer! Ain't
it lucky?"

‘My grand-nephew, that is to say,’ observed my aunt.

“It doesn’t matter,” returned Mr Dombey. “You can let her come and go
without regarding me.”

“Why, then I’ll tell you, sir,” returns the trooper, stopping short
and folding his arms on his square chest so angrily that his face
fires and flushes all over; “he is a confoundedly bad kind of man. He
is a slow-torturing kind of man. He is no more like flesh and blood
than a rusty old carbine is. He is a kind of man—by George!—that
has caused me more restlessness, and more uneasiness, and more
dissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together. That’s
the kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is!”

[[[SUMMARY FATE OF THE INSURRECTIONARY CHIEFS]]]

"A sovereign cure for the gout," said Mr. Pickwick, hastily producing
his note-book--"what is it?"

It so happened, however—as it will happen very often, when men fall
into company under such circumstances—that Mr. Bumble felt every now
and then a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal
a look at the stranger; and that whenever he did so he withdrew his
eyes in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment
stealing a look at him. Mr. Bumble’s awkwardness was enhanced by the
very remarkable expression of the stranger’s eye, which was keen and
bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike
anything he had ever observed before, and most repulsive to behold.

Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not
help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been
more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard
him thinking, for it said immediately:

Chapter XXIV

"I hope so," replied the child, "after I am dead, but not before. I know
the doctor must be right. Oliver; because I dream so much of heaven, and
angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. Kiss me," said
the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round
Oliver's neck. "Good-b'ye dear! God bless you!"

‘You’d better be quiet, young feller,’ remarked the boots, going
through a threatening piece of pantomime with the stick.

Mr. Pickwick introduces himself to Master Humphrey

“I could wish,” said Mr Toots, “to take this opportunity, Miss Dombey,
if I might, of entering into a word of explanation. I should have had
the pleasure of—of returning with Susan at an earlier period; but, in
the first place, we didn’t know the name of the relation to whose house
she had gone, and, in the second, as she had left that relation’s and
gone to another at a distance, I think that scarcely anything short of
the sagacity of the Chicken, would have found her out in the time.”

I followed the ferash, but could gain no intelligence from him which
could in the least clear up my doubts. One thing I discovered, which was
that no _felek_, or sticks, had been displayed in the Shah's presence as
preparatory to a bastinado; and so far I felt safe.

‘T’otherest!’ he said, hoarsely, as he bent across the table to touch
his arm. ‘The news has gone down the river afore you.’

“Why, George,” returns Mrs. Bagnet, “was always free with me, ma’am,
and when he said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things
my Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man, the
comfortablest would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line
into his mother’s face or turned a hair of her head grey, then I felt
sure, from his way, that something fresh had brought his own mother
into his mind. I had often known him say to me, in past times, that
he had behaved bad to her.”

‘He takes more care of my affairs, morning, noon, and night,’ said Mr
Boffin, ‘than fifty other men put together either could or would; and
yet he has ways of his own that are like tying a scaffolding-pole right
across the road, and bringing me up short when I am almost a-walking arm
in arm with him.’

Chapter XIV.

‘I should be lost without you, Eugene; but you may be right.’

There was a great water-party made up to go to Twickenham and dine, and
afterwards dance in an empty villa by the river-side, hired expressly for
the purpose.  Mr. and Mrs. Leaver were of the company; and it was our
fortune to have a seat in the same boat, which was an eight-oared galley,
manned by amateurs, with a blue striped awning of the same pattern as
their Guernsey shirts, and a dingy red flag of the same shade as the
whiskers of the stroke oar.  A coxswain being appointed, and all other
matters adjusted, the eight gentlemen threw themselves into strong
paroxysms, and pulled up with the tide, stimulated by the compassionate
remarks of the ladies, who one and all exclaimed, that it seemed an
immense exertion—as indeed it did.  At first we raced the other boat,
which came alongside in gallant style; but this being found an unpleasant
amusement, as giving rise to a great quantity of splashing, and rendering
the cold pies and other viands very moist, it was unanimously voted down,
and we were suffered to shoot a-head, while the second boat followed
ingloriously in our wake.

What Christmas is as we Grow Older

"Certainly, sir," said the testy little judge.

Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more
when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.

Forth from the city, while it yet slept, went the two poor wanderers,
they knew not whither.

“Help making him malicious and revengeful. I couldn’t hold any terms
with him, could I?”

"Why," said Mr. Pickwick, "I may have formed some ideas upon the
subject, but, as I have never submitted them to the test of experience,
I should be sorry if you were induced to regulate your proceedings by
them."

Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no
sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands
behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at
Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd
contortions. Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness,
and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his
benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair
again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr.
Brownlow’s heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old
gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into
his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently
philosophical to be in a condition to explain.

At about mid-day, we set out for the offices of Messrs. Spenlow and
Jorkins in Doctors' Commons. My aunt, who had this other general opinion
in reference to London, that every man she saw was a pickpocket, gave me
her purse to carry for her, which had ten guineas in it and some silver.

“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after
him. “And take a pipe with you!”

"My good sir," said Mr. Pickwick, "you will allow me to observe that
this is a very unnecessary display of excitement. I have only taken
places inside for two."

She put her hand in mine, and told me she was proud of me, and of what I
said; although I praised her very far beyond her worth. Then she went
on softly playing, but without removing her eyes from me. ‘Do you know,
what I have heard tonight, Agnes,’ said I, strangely seems to be a part
of the feeling with which I regarded you when I saw you first--with
which I sat beside you in my rough school-days?’

"And the leather hat-box?"

But whether, in this ride, you pass by obelisks, or columns ancient
temples, theatres, houses, porticoes, or forums: it is strange to see,
how every fragment, whenever it is possible, has been blended into some
modern structure, and made to serve some modern purpose—a wall, a
dwelling-place, a granary, a stable—some use for which it never was
designed, and associated with which it cannot otherwise than lamely
assort.  It is stranger still, to see how many ruins of the old
mythology: how many fragments of obsolete legend and observance: have
been incorporated into the worship of Christian altars here; and how, in
numberless respects, the false faith and the true are fused into a
monstrous union.

I am glad to say that Joe brought back enough yellow dust to keep the
wolf from the door for many a day. He and his wife are living somewhere
in Indiana. Joe, their son, was a drummer-boy in the Thirty-sixth Ohio,
under Captain Saunders, and I’ll venture to say no braver heart kept
time to his “Rat-tat-too” than that which beat under his own little
jacket.

"If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had
better do it, and decrease the surplus population.
Besides--excuse me--I don't know that."

‘A little devil,’ said the child.

_As it is to be performed at the Theatre-Royal, Drury-Lane, with
rapturous applause._

I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers
had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a
Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable
consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all
seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he
made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to
dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,
because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes
fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and
forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.

Go where ye _may_ for the May, boys!
      Folla yir nose, an' ye'll find it soon:
    On every hedge by the way, boys!
      Ye'll hear it singin' its scented tune,
    Unless by the breath o' your darlin' _kilt_!
      "Hurroo! for Leary the Piper's Lilt!"

Instead of replying, Hugh changed the leg on which he leant, shuffled
his cap from one hand to the other, looked at the ground, the wall, the
ceiling, and finally at Sir John himself; before whose pleasant face he
lowered his eyes again, and fixed them on the floor.

All this time, the Merry Monarch was as merry as ever, and as worthless
as ever. All this time, the debauched lords and gentlemen and the
shameless ladies danced and gamed and drank, and loved and hated one
another, according to their merry ways.

He said no more, but taking the money turned away with a slow,
uncertain step, and pressed his hand upon his head like a weary and
dejected man. The dwarf watched him sharply, while he passed into the
little sitting-room and locked it in an iron safe above the
chimney-piece; and after musing for a short space, prepared to take his
leave, observing that unless he made good haste, Mrs Quilp would
certainly be in fits on his return.

‘Oh, but for such, Columbia’s days were done;
     Rank without ripeness, quickened without sun,
     Crude at the surface, rotten at the core,

"Will my slow friend," said the captain, "lend me his arm, or I shall
sink right back'ards into this blessed steward's cookery?  Now, Tom,"
pursued the captain, when the required assistance was given, "on your
oath as a steward, didn't you take that desk to pieces to make a better
one of it, and put it together fresh,--or something of the kind?"

"That I hope you will not misunderstand my father.  Don't judge him,
sir, as you would judge others outside the gates.  He has been there so
long!  I never saw him outside, but I can understand that he must have
grown different in some things since."

Mr. Sapsea being informed by Mr. Crisparkle of the circumstances under
which they desired to make a voluntary statement before him, Mr. Jasper
broke silence by declaring that he placed his whole reliance, humanly
speaking, on Mr. Sapsea’s penetration. There was no conceivable reason
why his nephew should have suddenly absconded, unless Mr. Sapsea could
suggest one, and then he would defer. There was no intelligible
likelihood of his having returned to the river, and been accidentally
drowned in the dark, unless it should appear likely to Mr. Sapsea, and
then again he would defer. He washed his hands as clean as he could of
all horrible suspicions, unless it should appear to Mr. Sapsea that
some such were inseparable from his last companion before his
disappearance (not on good terms with previously), and then, once more,
he would defer. His own state of mind, he being distracted with doubts,
and labouring under dismal apprehensions, was not to be safely trusted;
but Mr. Sapsea’s was.

That’s the story, sir.’

On the door-step, appeared a proper figure of a landlord, too; for,
though he was a short man, he was round and broad, and stood with his
hands in his pockets, and his legs just wide enough apart to express a
mind at rest upon the subject of the cellar, and an easy confidence—too
calm and virtuous to become a swagger—in the general resources of the
Inn.  The superabundant moisture, trickling from everything after the
late rain, set him off well.  Nothing near him was thirsty.  Certain
top-heavy dahlias, looking over the palings of his neat well-ordered
garden, had swilled as much as they could carry—perhaps a trifle more—and
may have been the worse for liquor; but the sweet-briar, roses,
wall-flowers, the plants at the windows, and the leaves on the old tree,
were in the beaming state of moderate company that had taken no more than
was wholesome for them, and had served to develop their best qualities.
Sprinkling dewy drops about them on the ground, they seemed profuse of
innocent and sparkling mirth, that did good where it lighted, softening
neglected corners which the steady rain could seldom reach, and hurting
nothing.

‘The night was so dark,’ said Edward, ‘the attack so sudden, and he so
wrapped and muffled up, that I can hardly say. It seems that--’

As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying
as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out
of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I
told him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to
ask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he
deemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his
breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his
notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me
once, to put my question.

In a hard way, and in an uncertain way that fluctuated between patronage
and putting down, the sprinkling from a watering-pot and hydraulic
pressure, Mrs Clennam showed an interest in this dependent. Even in the
moment of her entrance, upon the violent ringing of the bell, when the
mother shielded herself with that singular action from the son, Mrs
Clennam’s eyes had had some individual recognition in them, which seemed
reserved for her. As there are degrees of hardness in the hardest metal,
and shades of colour in black itself, so, even in the asperity of Mrs
Clennam’s demeanour towards all the rest of humanity and towards Little
Dorrit, there was a fine gradation.

"What do _you_ think, Mr. Pickwick?" inquired Bob Sawyer. Mr. Pickwick
was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr. Weller, and said in a
stern voice, "Take his skates off."

I told him I could easily believe it.

King readily complied, and he having armed himself with a heavy stick,
and Grimaldi with an old broadsword which he had hastily snatched
from its peg on the first alarm, they crept cautiously into the back
garden, which was separated from those of the houses on either side by
a wall from three to four feet high, and from a very extensive piece of
pasture-land beyond it at the bottom, by another wall two or three feet
higher.

Hastily taking leave of Lady Brabazon, who chided him playfully for
running away so early, and engaged him to call upon her on the following
morning, he went downstairs accompanied by Trussell. They found Jacob at
the door, and in no very bland humour at having been kept so long.

‘Brother, Tom. Brother.’

The letter from Little White Lion Street does not impress me favourably.
It is not written in a simple or truthful manner, I am afraid, and is
_not_ a good reference. Moreover, I think it probable that the writer
may have deserted some pursuit for which he is qualified, for vague and
laborious strivings which he has no pretensions to make. However, I will
certainly act on your impression of him, whatever it may be. And if you
could explain to the gentleman in Nelson Square, that I am not evading
his request, but that I do not know of anything to which I can recommend
him, it would be a great relief to me.

Lemon has a coat of frieze,
  But all so seldom Lemon wears it,
  That it is a prey to fleas,
  And ev'ry moth that's hungry, tears it.
  Oh, that coat's the coat for me,
  That braves the railway sparks and breezes,
  Leaving ev'ry engine free
  To smoke it, till its owner sneezes!
      Then my Lemon, round and fat,
      L., my bright, my right, my tight 'un,
      Think a little what you're at--
      On Tuesday first, come down to Brighton!

"_She_ never forgets," returned Caleb. "It's one of the few things she
an't clever in."

The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.

"Killed him?"

“Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,” said the doctor. “It’s very natural
that he should be thirsty. You may give him a little tea, ma’am, and
some dry toast without any butter. Don’t keep him too warm, ma’am; but
be careful that you don’t let him be too cold; will you have the
goodness?”

‘Now, shiny Villiam,’ said the hostler to the deputy hostler, ‘give the
gen’lm’n the ribbons.’

‘I have only the commission of my love for her, and her love for me.  I
have no other trust, than that I have been with her since she came home,
and that she has given me her confidence.  I have no further trust, than
that I know something of her character and her marriage.  O Mr.
Harthouse, I think you had that trust too!’

The fair Volumnia, not quite unconscious perhaps of the humanizing
influence of her charms, pauses in the writing of cocked-hat notes
and meditatively adjusts the pearl necklace. Mr. Bucket prices that
decoration in his mind and thinks it as likely as not that Volumnia
is writing poetry.

‘We are betrayed,’ said Firebras, in a deep whisper.

No, no!  There is something as well,--something outside myself.

‘What’s my uncle been a-talking about?’

It required a strong confidence in the locksmith’s veracity to lead any
one to this belief, for every sense and faculty that Barnaby possessed,
seemed to be fixed upon his game, to the exclusion of all other things.
Something in the young man’s face expressed this opinion, for Gabriel
repeated what he had just said, more earnestly than before, and with
another glance towards Barnaby, again asked what like the man was.

_William_ (_again cocking his leg, and slapping
        the thighs very hard_). Avast heaving, your
        honour! I see your honour's signal fluttering
        in the breeze, without a glass. As I was
        a-saying, your honour, the wind was blowin'
        from the sou'-west, due sou'-west, your honour,
        not a pint to larboard nor a pint to starboard;
        the clouds a-gatherin' in the distance for all
        the world like Beachy Head in a fog, the sea
        a-rowling in, in heaps of foam, and making
        higher than the mainyard arm, the craft
        a-scuddin' by all taught and under storms'ils
        for the harbour; not a blessed star a-twinklin'
        out aloft--aloft, your honour, in the little
        cherubs' native country--and the spray is
        flying like the white foam from the Jolly's
        lips when Poll of Portsea took him for a
        tailor! (_laughs._)

As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an
ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey
a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman
thought it advisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being
uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme.

Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,
and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must
go away at the end of the week.

Scott does very well indeed. As a dresser he is perfect. In a quarter of
an hour after I go into the retiring-room, where all my clothes are
airing and everything is set out neatly in its own allotted space, I am
ready; and he then goes softly out, and sits outside the door. In the
morning he is equally punctual, quiet, and quick. He has his needles and
thread, buttons, and so forth, always at hand; and in travelling he is
very systematic with the luggage. What with Dolby and what with this
skilful valet, everything is made as easy to me as it possibly _can_ be,
and Dolby would do anything to lighten the work, and does everything.

I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of
these pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can
remember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my
doll when we were alone together, “Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you
know very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!” And so
she used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful
complexion and rosy lips, staring at me—or not so much at me, I
think, as at nothing—while I busily stitched away and told her every
one of my secrets.

‘Ah—h!’ sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her
head.

“Stand still a moment, and I’ll get you one,” replied the voice. The
receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,
the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He
bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft
stick.

‘It’s a weakness in our family,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, ‘so, of course,
I can’t be blamed for it. Your grandmama, Kate, was exactly the
same--precisely. The least excitement, the slightest surprise--she
fainted away directly. I have heard her say, often and often, that when
she was a young lady, and before she was married, she was turning
a corner into Oxford Street one day, when she ran against her own
hairdresser, who, it seems, was escaping from a bear;--the mere
suddenness of the encounter made her faint away directly. Wait, though,’
added Mrs. Nickleby, pausing to consider. ‘Let me be sure I’m right. Was
it her hairdresser who had escaped from a bear, or was it a bear who had
escaped from her hairdresser’s? I declare I can’t remember just now, but
the hairdresser was a very handsome man, I know, and quite a gentleman
in his manners; so that it has nothing to do with the point of the
story.’

With that, he fell into the rear to walk with Mark, while Martin and
Elijah Pogram went on to the National.

‘With him now!’ cried Brass; ‘Ha ha!  There let ‘em be, merry and free,
toor rul lol le.  Eh, Mr Richard?  Ha ha!’

“Oh, yes, my Lady!”

‘There,’ I said.

Little Dorrit stopped, for there was neither happiness nor health in the
face that turned to her.

"We will be happy," replied the old man. "Let me go, Nell.  I shall but
win back my own; and it's all for thee, my darling."

His brother pointed to the letters, and was again withdrawing.

Serle, Mr., letter to, 263

For a day or two I was undecided whether to respond to this call, or take
no notice of it.  I was not conscious of the slightest mysterious bias,
influence, or attraction, one way or other.  Of that I am as strictly
sure as of every other statement that I make here.  Ultimately I decided,
as a break in the monotony of my life, that I would go.

‘Is it,’ said Barnacle junior, taking heed of his visitor’s brown face,
‘anything about--Tonnage--or that sort of thing?’

‘I can calc’late my distance, sir,’ returned Mr Chollop, ‘to an inch.’

NOTULÆ.

They stopped at a cottage door, and the schoolmaster knocked softly at
it with his hand.  It was opened without loss of time, and they entered
a room where a little group of women were gathered about one older than
the rest, who was crying and rocking herself to and fro.

Mr. Trotter acquiesced in this agreeable proposal; and having deposited
his book in his coat pocket, accompanied Mr. Weller to the tap, where
they were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound, formed
by mixing together, in a pewter vessel, certain quantities of British
Hollands and the fragrant essence of the clove.

The day arrived. A raging winter day, that shook the old house,
sometimes, as if it shivered in the blast. A day to make home doubly
home. To give the chimney corner new delights. To shed a ruddier glow
upon the faces gathered round the hearth; and draw each fireside group
into a closer and more social league, against the roaring elements
without. Such a wild winter day as best prepares the way for shut-out
night; for curtained rooms, and cheerful looks; for music, laughter,
dancing, light, and jovial entertainment!

Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man
of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet, and crush a man or two below.

“I have something lying here that is no love trinket, and sooner than
endure your touch once more, I would use it on you—and you know it,
while I speak—with less reluctance than I would on any other creeping
thing that lives.”

"How do _you_ come here?" he asked.

Is there within thy heart a need
That mine cannot fulfil?
One chord that any other hand
Could better wake or still?
Speak now--lest at some future day my whole life wither and decay.

‘Indeed I don’t know,’ returned the child.

It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any
very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist’s ninth birthday
found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and
decidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had
implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver’s breast. It had had plenty
of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment;
and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any
ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth
birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select
party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating
with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously
presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house,
was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the
beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.

‘I have always expected that he and I would be brought together again in
the course of business,’ said Slyme, taking a fresh handful of nuts from
his pocket; ‘but I thought he would be wanted for some swindling job; it
never entered my head that I should hold a warrant for the apprehension
of his murderer.’

‘You want some one?’ said the lady in a stern manner.

‘Dearest Lavinia,’ urged Mr Sampson, pathetically, ‘I adore you.’

‘Dear uncle!’ murmured the young lady, and turned her face aside to hide
her tears.

“Nor me,” interposed the Manager.

Mr. Hewson said preremptorily=> Mr. Hewson said peremptorily {pg 235}

"I found out a English gentleman as was in authority," said Mr.
Peggotty, "and told him I was a going to seek my niece. He got me them
papers as I wanted fur to carry me through--I doen't rightly know how
they're called--and he would have give me money, but that I was thankful
to have no need on. I thank him kind, for all he done, I'm sure! 'I've
wrote afore you,' he says to me, 'and I shall speak to many as will come
that way, and many will know you, fur distant from here, when you're a
travelling alone.' I told him, best as I was able, what my gratitoode
was, and went away through France."

‘No, not at all. I have no such intention.’

I have no energy whatever, I am very miserable. I loathe domestic
hearths. I yearn to be a vagabond. Why can't I marry Mary?[38] Why have I
seven children--not engaged at sixpence a-night apiece, and dismissable
for ever, if they tumble down, not taken on for an indefinite time at a
vast expense, and never,--no never, never,--wearing lighted candles
round their heads.[39] I am deeply miserable. A real house like this is
insupportable, after that canvas farm wherein I was so happy. What is a
humdrum dinner at half-past five, with nobody (but John) to see me eat
it, compared with _that_ soup, and the hundreds of pairs of eyes that
watched its disappearance? Forgive this tear.[40] It is weak and foolish,
I know.

Here, both Mr. and Mrs. Wititterly, who had talked rather at the Nicklebys
than to each other, left off speaking, and looked at their two hearers,
with an expression of countenance which seemed to say, ‘What do you
think of all this?’

With the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house
by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we
inaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see
us. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in
drawing to an end, but when I write of him, my tears will have their
way.

“Where are they?” he inquired.

“I never will!” exclaimed the child.

Morley, Mr., i. 399

‘Then you return my love?’ said Harry. ‘Say but that, dear Rose; say
but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!’

Somehow, a canopy of wet blanket seems to descend upon the company, and
Lady Tippins was never known to turn so very greedy or so very cross.
Mortimer Lightwood alone brightens. He has been asking himself, as to
every other member of the Committee in turn, ‘I wonder whether you are
the Voice!’ But he does not ask himself the question after Twemlow has
spoken, and he glances in Twemlow’s direction as if he were grateful.
When the company disperse—by which time Mr and Mrs Veneering have had
quite as much as they want of the honour, and the guests have had quite
as much as THEY want of the other honour—Mortimer sees Twemlow home,
shakes hands with him cordially at parting, and fares to the Temple,
gaily.

It was fine in the morning, particularly in the fine mornings. It looked
a very fresh, free life, by daylight: still fresher, and more free, by
sunlight. But as the day declined, the life seemed to go down too. I
don't know how it was; it seldom looked well by candle-light. I wanted
somebody to talk to, then. I missed Agnes. I found a tremendous blank,
in the place of that smiling repository of my confidence. Mrs. Crupp
appeared to be a long way off. I thought about my predecessor, who had
died of drink and smoke; and I could have wished he had been so good as
to live, and not bother me with his decease.

His voice, more and more faltering in the utterance of these words,
stopped for a few moments; then he went on:

‘It can’t be, sir. It cannot be,’ said the old lady energetically.

‘“Oh, don’t tell me,” said Tom, “I know him.”

All this was very genteel and pleasant; and, to make matters still more
comfortable, Mr. Smangle assured Mr. Pickwick a great many more times
that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman;
which sentiment, indeed, did him infinite credit, as he could be in no
wise supposed to understand them.

‘I am not going abroad again. My brother is, but I am not. He was always
attached to me, and he is so grateful to me now--so much too grateful,
for it is only because I happened to be with him in his illness--that
he says I shall be free to stay where I like best, and to do what I like
best. He only wishes me to be happy, he says.’

‘I mean to say, you’re quite wore out.’

"I have said already that I never dance," replied I. "Go on."

"I'll tell you what it is," cried Steiner, and a flush overspread his
face; "Taylor has been using you for his own purposes. You have been
endeavouring to undermine our connexion, and have been serving him at
the same time that you have taken our wages."

“No, sir; my husband was.”

The indignation of Dot at this presumptuous assertion is not to be
described. What next? His imagination would compass the possibility of
just such another Baby, perhaps. The man was mad.

"If your journey is not a long one," he added to the travellers, "you're
very welcome to pass another night here.  I should really be glad if you
would do so, as I am very lonely to-day."

_Mr. B._ I will--with great pleasure. [_Exit_, R.]

“Yes,” replied Oliver.

‘Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere?’ said the dressmaker, with an
inquiring look.

‘I WILL speak!’ she said, turning on me with her lightning eyes. ‘Be
silent, you! Look at me, I say, proud mother of a proud, false son! Moan
for your nurture of him, moan for your corruption of him, moan for your
loss of him, moan for mine!’

With that she began to bustle about most vigorously; presenting, as she
did so, an appearance sufficiently peculiar to justify a word of
introduction.

XXX

“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”

There was something so odd in the old man’s sudden energy, and the
subject which had called it forth, that Mr. Pickwick was prepared with
no observation in reply; and the old man checking his impetuosity, and
resuming the leer, which had disappeared during his previous excitement,
said--

"Yes, sir," rejoined Mr. Weller. "Wotever is, is right, as the young
nobleman sveetly remarked ven they put him down in the pension list
'cos his mother's uncle's vife's grandfather vunce lit the king's pipe
vith a portable tinder-box."

“The housekeeping keys, miss.”

The Captain put down the paper, took off his spectacles, and brought
his eyes to bear on the deserter.

"I do," replied Bob Sawyer.

"Oh! I know their tricks and their manners."

Here the entry terminates, as we have no doubt the debate did also,
after arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point.
We have no official statement of the facts which the reader will find
recorded in the next chapter, but they have been carefully collated
from letters and other MS. authorities, so unquestionably genuine as to
justify their narration in a connected form.

Toodle was evidently not to be bought over.

Knowing this, I thought it very likely that, however artful
Bourgonef might be, a severe examination might extort from him
sufficient confirmation of my suspicion to warrant further
procedure.  But knowing also that THIS resort was open to me when
all others had failed, I resolved to wait and watch.

On the little bell giving clamorous notice of a visitor’s approach (for
Mr Bailey came in at the door with a lunge, to get as much sound out of
the bell as possible), Poll Sweedlepipe desisted from the contemplation
of a favourite owl, and gave his young friend hearty welcome.

Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been
wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder, whether all
boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards
from thenceforth, on that account.

A long silence ensued, during which the Jew was plunged in deep
thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villany perfectly
demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time; and Nancy,
apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes
fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.

Biler whimpered, would he though? oh no he wouldn’t—and what was he
doing of—and why didn’t he strangle some—body of his own size and not
him: but Biler was quelled by the extraordinary nature of his
reception, and, as his head became stationary, and he looked the
gentleman in the face, or rather in the teeth, and saw him snarling at
him, he so far forgot his manhood as to cry.

“Master,” returned the other, shaking his head, “I have begun to
understand a little that most calamities will come from us, as this one
did, and that none will stop at our poor doors, until we are united with
that great squabbling family yonder, to do the things that are right.  We
cannot live healthily and decently, unless they who undertook to manage
us provide the means.  We cannot be instructed unless they will teach us;
we cannot be rationally amused, unless they will amuse us; we cannot but
have some false gods of our own, while they set up so many of theirs in
all the public places.  The evil consequences of imperfect instruction,
the evil consequences of pernicious neglect, the evil consequences of
unnatural restraint and the denial of humanising enjoyments, will all
come from us, and none of them will stop with us.  They will spread far
and wide.  They always do; they always have done—just like the
pestilence.  I understand so much, I think, at last.”

Never mind the aberrations of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the religion or
the politics of Tom Paine, or the biography of Tom Moore. On all these
matters I may hold my own opinions, but they are not wanted now; but
have we not here the feelings of Jaques? Here are the gloomy expressions
of general sorrow over climate, privation, disease, thankless toil,
advancing years, unstrung frame. But here also we have ecstatic
emotions of Arab-like independence, generous reflections upon political
adversaries, and high-minded adherence to the views and principles which
in his honour and conscience he believed to be in all circumstances
inflexibly right, coming from the heart of a forest. The Backwoodsman is
Dunlop; and is he, in spite of this sad-sounding passage, melancholy?
Not he, in good sooth. The very next page to that which I have quoted is
a description of the pleasant mode of travelling in Canada, before the
march of improvement had made it comfortable and convenient.[102]

Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor’s court this murky afternoon
besides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three
counsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before
mentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;
and there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or
whatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,
for no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the
cause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The
short-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of
the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when
Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on
a seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained
sanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is
always in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting
some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say
she really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for
certain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a
reticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of
paper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in
custody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application “to
purge himself of his contempt,” which, being a solitary surviving
executor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts
of which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is
not at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life
are ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from
Shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at
the close of the day’s business and who can by no means be made to
understand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence
after making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself
in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out “My
Lord!” in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.
A few lawyers’ clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger
on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal
weather a little.

‘I say, Rosa, not a word! If he can stake his all upon the lightest
object, I can stake my all upon a greater purpose. Let him go where he
will, with the means that my love has secured to him! Does he think to
reduce me by long absence? He knows his mother very little if he does.
Let him put away his whim now, and he is welcome back. Let him not put
her away now, and he never shall come near me, living or dying, while
I can raise my hand to make a sign against it, unless, being rid of her
for ever, he comes humbly to me and begs for my forgiveness. This is my
right. This is the acknowledgement I WILL HAVE. This is the separation
that there is between us! And is this,’ she added, looking at her
visitor with the proud intolerant air with which she had begun, ‘no
injury?’

‘I don’t know why she should, though there are many likely reasons,’ said
the client, smiling at the attention and perplexity expressed in Mr.
Snitchey’s shining eye, and at his cautious way of carrying on the
conversation, and making himself informed upon the subject; ‘but I know
she does.  She was very young when she made the engagement—if it may be
called one, I am not even sure of that—and has repented of it, perhaps.
Perhaps—it seems a foppish thing to say, but upon my soul I don’t mean it
in that light—she may have fallen in love with me, as I have fallen in
love with her.’

The girl turned her face towards him with a start, and rowed in silence.
Her face was very pale. He was a hook-nosed man, and with that and his
bright eyes and his ruffled head, bore a certain likeness to a roused
bird of prey.

‘Ugh!’ said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; ‘a couple of
glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good.
Wouldn’t they, Tom White, eh?’

‘I believe you, Muster Gashford,’ interposed the hangman with a grave
nod. ‘The uncertainties as I’ve seen in reference to this here state of
existence, the unexpected contingencies as have come about!--Oh my eye!’
Feeling the subject much too vast for expression, he puffed at his pipe
again, and looked the rest.

We have already had occasion to observe that Mrs. Chirrup is an
incomparable housewife.  In all the arts of domestic arrangement and
management, in all the mysteries of confectionery-making, pickling, and
preserving, never was such a thorough adept as that nice little body.
She is, besides, a cunning worker in muslin and fine linen, and a special
hand at marketing to the very best advantage.  But if there be one branch
of housekeeping in which she excels to an utterly unparalleled and
unprecedented extent, it is in the important one of carving.  A roast
goose is universally allowed to be the great stumbling-block in the way
of young aspirants to perfection in this department of science; many
promising carvers, beginning with legs of mutton, and preserving a good
reputation through fillets of veal, sirloins of beef, quarters of lamb,
fowls, and even ducks, have sunk before a roast goose, and lost caste and
character for ever.  To Mrs. Chirrup the resolving a goose into its
smallest component parts is a pleasant pastime—a practical joke—a thing
to be done in a minute or so, without the smallest interruption to the
conversation of the time.  No handing the dish over to an unfortunate man
upon her right or left, no wild sharpening of the knife, no hacking and
sawing at an unruly joint, no noise, no splash, no heat, no leaving off
in despair; all is confidence and cheerfulness.  The dish is set upon the
table, the cover is removed; for an instant, and only an instant, you
observe that Mrs. Chirrup’s attention is distracted; she smiles, but
heareth not.  You proceed with your story; meanwhile the glittering knife
is slowly upraised, both Mrs. Chirrup’s wrists are slightly but not
ungracefully agitated, she compresses her lips for an instant, then
breaks into a smile, and all is over.  The legs of the bird slide gently
down into a pool of gravy, the wings seem to melt from the body, the
breast separates into a row of juicy slices, the smaller and more
complicated parts of his anatomy are perfectly developed, a cavern of
stuffing is revealed, and the goose is gone!

‘Stay a minute,’ said Short.  ‘A man of the name of Jerry--you know
Jerry, Thomas?’

MY DEAR LETITIA,

Mrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a
family of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost. She
regards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, a
genteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.

‘Oh! I really don’t know what to say,’ replied Mrs. Curdle. ‘It’s not as
if the theatre was in its high and palmy days--you needn’t stand, Miss
Snevellicci--the drama is gone, perfectly gone.’

'Will you, or will you not answer my question, sir?'

But, before his daughter could make him any answer, she was taken with
a troublesome cough, and it was such a very unpleasant cough, that,
when she left off, the tears were starting in her bright eyes. The
good-natured locksmith was still patting her on the back and applying
such gentle restoratives, when a message arrived from Mrs Varden, making
known to all whom it might concern, that she felt too much indisposed
to rise after her great agitation and anxiety of the previous night; and
therefore desired to be immediately accommodated with the little black
teapot of strong mixed tea, a couple of rounds of buttered toast, a
middling-sized dish of beef and ham cut thin, and the Protestant Manual
in two volumes post octavo. Like some other ladies who in remote
ages flourished upon this globe, Mrs Varden was most devout when most
ill-tempered. Whenever she and her husband were at unusual variance,
then the Protestant Manual was in high feather.

CHAPTER VII
MRS. SPARSIT

“Why, who can she be?” said I.

‘Would the last remedy be fair?’

Walter paused to ascertain if the Captain had any particular
information to add to this, but as he said no more, went on.

‘Yes, for my nephew,’ said my aunt.

FAMILIAR EPISTLE FROM A PARENT TO A CHILD
AGED TWO YEARS AND TWO MONTHS

‘Is nothing to be said to me?’ cried Wardle, with open arms.

"It only remains," said Grandmarina in conclusion, "to make an end of the
fish-bone."

On his first discovery of his situation, he had determined to take
the utmost care of his health and intellect that the place allowed,
as the sole basis of his hope of deliverance.  But as that hope
declined, he neglected the means of realizing it.  He had at first
risen early, walked incessantly about his cell, and availed himself
of every opportunity of being in the open air.  He took the
strictest care of his person in point of cleanliness, and with or
without appetite, regularly forced down his miserable meals; and
all these efforts were even pleasant, as long as hope prompted
them.  But now he began to relax them all.  He passed half the day
in his wretched bed, in which he frequently took his meals,
declined shaving or changing his linen, and, when the sun shone
into his cell, he turned from it on his straw with a sigh of
heartbroken despondency.  Formerly, when the air breathed through
his grating, he used to say, "Blessed air of heaven, I shall
breathe you once more in freedom!--Reserve all your freshness for
that delicious evening when I shall inhale you, and be as free as
you myself."  Now when he felt it, he sighed and said nothing.  The
twitter of the sparrows, the pattering of rain, or the moan of the
wind, sounds that he used to sit up in his bed to catch with
delight, as reminding him of nature, were now unheeded.

Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr. Weller, and
said in a stern voice, “Take his skaits off.”

There is your monster who thinks of it as a place to which a man
does not walk but into which he slinks to drink; and there is your
monster who thinks of it as a place to be reached in a railway train
and there to put on fine clothes for dinner and to be waited upon by
Germans. There is your more amiable monster, who says: "I hear there
is a good inn at Little Studley or Bampton Major. Let us go there."
He waits until he has begun to be hungry, and he shoots there in an
enormous automobile. There is your still more amiable monster, who in a
hippo-mobile hippogriffically tools into a town and throws the ribbons
to the person in gaiters with a straw in his mouth, and feels (oh, men,
my brothers) that he is doing something like someone in a book. All
these men, whether they frankly hate or whether they pretend to love,
are the enemies of inns, and the enemies of inns are accursed before
their Creator and their kind.

“Ay!” the Dean echoes; “Durdles, Durdles!”

“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.

‘I have been so habituated,’ returned Arthur, at a loss, ‘during
the short time I have known her, to consider Little--I have been so
habituated to consider Miss Dorrit in a light altogether removed from
that in which you present her to me, that you quite take me by surprise.
Does she know your son?’

‘My one room,’ replied that much-injured gentleman, ‘was on the coffee-
room flight.’

Something clicked in his throat, as if he had works in him like a clock,
and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged, rough sleeve over
his eyes.

He turned on Florence, as if it were she who had spoken, and bade her
leave the room. Florence with her covered face obeyed, trembling and
weeping as she went.

‘I should like to hear that same story,’ said the red-faced man with the
cigar.

"I think I heard you mention Doctor Jeddler's name, as I came in,"
inquired the stranger. "That bill reminds me of him; for I happen to
know something of that story, by hearsay, and through certain connexions
of mine.--Is the old man living?"

(BURNS) from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread
before us.

‘Why, of course not, Pa,’ said Bella, giving him another shake or two.

Over the prisoner’s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it, and had passed from its surface and this earth’s together. Haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner’s mind. Be
that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his
face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.

‘The contest,’ said Pott, ‘shall be prolonged so long as I have health
and strength, and that portion of talent with which I am gifted. From
that contest, Sir, although it may unsettle men’s minds and excite their
feelings, and render them incapable for the discharge of the everyday
duties of ordinary life; from that contest, sir, I will never shrink,
till I have set my heel upon the Eatanswill _Independent_. I wish the
people of London, and the people of this country to know, sir, that they
may rely upon me--that I will not desert them, that I am resolved to
stand by them, Sir, to the last.’

‘Well! Look after him for the present, and--let me see--three days from
this time let the other woman come here, and we’ll see if we can make
a bargain of it. About nine or ten o’clock at night, say. Keep your eye
upon him in the meanwhile, and don’t talk about it. He’s as mad as a
March hare!’

“Wish you good evening, sir,” says the woman, in such a sudden way, and
in such a cracked voice, that it was quite startling to hear her.  “Chilly
weather, ain’t it, sir?  Please to walk in.  You come from good Mr.
Forley, don’t you, sir?”

‘Believe me, dear Uncle,
‘Yours affectionately,
‘Charles Kitterbell.

"You are a man," returned the Captain, with grave indignation, "of
education and superior advantages; and if you say that, meaning what you
say, you have sunk lower than I had believed. How low that must be, I
leave you to consider, knowing what I know of your disgrace, and seeing
what I see."

CHAPTER XXI.
THE EXPEDITION

‘Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees,
and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a
street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the
information you can.’

‘I do not doubt it. Yet Arthur is, of the whole world, the one person
from whom I would conceal this, while I am in it. I kept over him as
a child, in the days of his first remembrance, my restraining and
correcting hand. I was stern with him, knowing that the transgressions
of the parents are visited on their offspring, and that there was an
angry mark upon him at his birth. I have sat with him and his father,
seeing the weakness of his father yearning to unbend to him; and forcing
it back, that the child might work out his release in bondage and
hardship. I have seen him, with his mother’s face, looking up at me in
awe from his little books, and trying to soften me with his mother’s
ways that hardened me.’

_Pop._ I smother!

‘I mean, enough.’

But, in order that the reader may understand what a monument of folly
these frog-eaters have raised in their abattoirs and cattle-markets, and
may compare it with what common counselling has done for us all these
years, and would still do but for the innovating spirit of the times,
here follows a short account of a recent visit to these places:

One day she was sitting in a market-place on a bench outside an inn,
with her little wares for sale, when the deadness that she strove
against came over her so heavily that the scene departed from before
her eyes; when it returned, she found herself on the ground, her head
supported by some good-natured market-women, and a little crowd about
her.

"It's a conspiracy," said Ben Allen.

"You think that may be taken for granted?" said Mr. Magnus; "because if
she did not do that at the right place, it would be embarrassing."

“Now, Miss Summerson,” he said to me as we walked quickly away.
“They’ve got her ladyship’s watch among ’em. That’s a positive fact.”

"True," said the old man, faintly.  "Yes. But tell me again, Nell.  My
head fails me. What was it that he told you?  Nothing more than that he
would see me to-morrow or next day?  That was in the note."

She now urged the Dauphin (who always kept out of the way when there
was any fighting) to proceed to Rheims, as the first part of her
mission was accomplished; and to complete the whole by being crowned
there. The Dauphin was in no particular hurry to do this, as Rheims was
a long way off, and the English and the Duke of Burgundy were still
strong in the country through which the road lay. However, they set
forth, with ten thousand men, and again the Maid of Orleans rode on and
on, upon her white war-horse, and in her shining armour. Whenever they
came to a town which yielded readily, the soldiers believed in her;
but, whenever they came to a town which gave them any trouble, they
began to murmur that she was an impostor. The latter was particularly
the case at Troyes, which finally yielded, however, through the
persuasion of one Richard, a friar of the place. Friar Richard was in
the old doubt about the Maid of Orleans, until he had sprinkled her
well with holy water, and had also well sprinkled the threshold of the
gate by which she came into the city. Finding that it made no change in
her or the gate, he said, as the other grave old gentlemen had said,
that it was all right, and became her great ally.

Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.

“Yes, Captain, since you put it in that shape, I have got another
berth,” cried Rob, backing more and more; “a better berth than I’ve got
here, and one where I don’t so much as want your good word, Captain,
which is fort’nate for me, after all the dirt you’ve throw’d at me,
because I’m poor, and can’t afford to stand in my own light for your
good. Yes, I have got another berth; and if it wasn’t for leaving you
unprovided, Captain, I’d go to it now, sooner than I’d take them names
from you, because I’m poor, and can’t afford to stand in my own light
for your good. Why do you reproach me for being poor, and not standing
in my own light for your good, Captain? How can you so demean
yourself?”

‘This is the man,’ he said, extending his hand towards Jonas. ‘Is it?’

‘In the pound,’ replied the mob.

_Blow._ (_to O'T._)--He's wide awake, Tim. (_To the Capt._) Con.
  you're up to snuff!

"Hallo," said that eccentric functionary, "furniter's cheap vere you
come from, sir. Self-acting ink, that 'ere; it's wrote your mark upon
the wall, old gen'lm'n. Hold still, sir: wot's the use o' runnin' arter
a man as has made his lucky, and got to t'other end of the Borough by
this time?"

"Not a whisper of my name," replied Pott; "this is a buff neighbourhood.
If the excited and irritable populace knew I was here, I should be torn
to pieces."

Will was deeply grieved. He had been old enough to be told the family
shame when, more than two years before, his father had had his letter to
his daughter returned by her mistress in Manchester, telling him that
Lizzie had left her service some time--and why. He had sympathized with
his father’s stern anger; though he had thought him something hard, it
is true, when he had forbidden his weeping, heart-broken wife to go and
try to find her poor sinning child, and declared that henceforth they
would have no daughter that she should be as one dead, and her name
never more be named at market or at meal time, in blessing or in prayer.
He had held his peace, with compressed lips and contracted brow, when
the neighbors had noticed to him how poor Lizzie’s death had aged both
his father and his mother; and how they thought the bereaved couple
would never hold up their heads again. He himself had felt as if that
one event had made him old before his time; and had envied Tom the tears
he had shed over poor, pretty, innocent, dead Lizzie. He thought about
her sometimes, till he ground his teeth, and could have struck her down
in her shame. His mother had never named her to him until now.

"Ain't you!" said the waiter. "Young gentlemen is generally tired of
beef and mutton, have a weal cutlet!"

XII.  THE THREE STRANGERS. By Thomas Hardy (1840)

"My dear sir," urged the little man.

“Ah! you’re not used to it. I’m as fresh as a four-year-old. Well, what
did you do last night, Spooney?”

It occurred to young Holliday, the moment he heard these words, that the
stranger had been asked an exorbitant price for a bed at The Two Robins;
and that he was unable or unwilling to pay it.  The moment his back was
turned, Arthur, comfortably conscious of his own well-filled pockets,
addressed himself in a great hurry, for fear any other benighted
traveller should slip in and forestall him, to the sly-looking landlord
with the dirty apron and the bald head.

In all other respects I think the entire change has done me undoubted
service already. I am free of the book, and am red-faced; and feel
marvellously disposed to sleep.

‘Then you had better avoid her for a short time, if she does,’ said Mrs
Todgers, ‘and come to know her again, by degrees. That’s my advice.’

CHAPTER 58

The brief and sanguinary affray, which was fully detailed in the
evidence given on the trial of the chief conspirator, we think will
bear us out regarding the in competency of the leaders and the general
inefficiency of an Irish mob. More was in Emmett’s favour than he was
entitled to have expected. The government, although rumour was rife
with alarm, had turned a deaf ear to every attempt to awake it from its
culpable security. The detective police of that day, a crew of mercenary
bloodhounds, showed that within the heart of the city treasonable plans
could be matured, and not a functionary suspect it. To stimulate
Sirr and his myrmidons to exertion, crime was not to be prevented but
committed, and a regular price must first be placed upon the offender.
The apathy of the government and the imbecility of the conspiracy were
worthy of each other. On the night of the 23rd of July one hundred
determined men, by a well-arranged _coup de main_, might have easily
obtained possession of the castle.

“Pray tell us the story,” says Watt in a half whisper.

[Sidenote: Mr. William Charles Kent.]

The artist was perplex'd--the case was alter'd:
      Distrust, stirr'd up by doubt, his bosom warps;
    "God bless my soul!" he falter'd;
      "But, surely, you can let me see the corpse?
    An artist but requires a hint:
    There are the features--give the cheeks a tint--
    Paint in the eyes--and, though the task's a hard 'un,
      You'll find the thing, I'll swear,
    As like as he can,--no, I beg your pardon,--
      As like as he _could_ stare!"

"A strange legend has got abroad that after the deed was done, the
figure rose, took the head from the basket, walked forth through
the garden, and by the screaming porters at the gate, and went and
laid itself down at the Morgue.  But for this I will not vouch.
Only of this be sure.  'There are more things in heaven and earth,
Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.'  More and more
the light peeps through the chinks.  Soon, amidst music ravishing,
the curtain will rise, and the glorious scene be displayed.  Adieu!
Remember me.  Ha! 'tis dawn," Pinto said.  And he was gone.

‘Riches became mine, wealth poured in upon me, and I rioted in pleasures
enhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousness of my well-kept
secret. I inherited an estate. The law--the eagle-eyed law itself--had
been deceived, and had handed over disputed thousands to a madman’s
hands. Where was the wit of the sharp-sighted men of sound mind? Where
the dexterity of the lawyers, eager to discover a flaw? The madman’s
cunning had overreached them all.

‘Nor is it my uncle’s nature either,’ she replied, with a heightened
colour in her cheek. ‘It is not his nature to stab in the dark, nor is
it mine to love such deeds.’

"Indeed?"

He ordered me like a dog, and I obeyed like a dog.

“A creature,” continued the young man, passionately, “a creature as
fair and innocent of guile as one of God’s own angels, fluttered
between life and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to
which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to
the sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were
passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts
upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who
linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that
you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and
the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all
these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved
you—these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine,
by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,
and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never
know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in
its course. You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some
drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream
of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a
high and rushing tide. I have watched you change almost from death, to
life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep
affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has
softened my heart to all mankind.”

With the last days of the old year came an unexpected chance of spending
an evening with Marguerite, which Vendale resolved should be a chance of
speaking privately to her as well.  A cordial note from Obenreizer
invited him, on New Year's Day, to a little family dinner in Soho Square.
"We shall be only four," the note said.  "We shall be only two," Vendale
determined, "before the evening is out!"

"Indian chiefs, arise!
      The glorious hour's gone forth,
    And in the world's eyes
      Display who gave you birth!
    Indian chiefs, let us go
    In arms to Mexico;
    Till the Spanish blood shall flow
      In a river at our feet.

‘Oh yes,’ replied Nicholas: ‘it’s very true, no doubt.’

Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might
have been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and
bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to
proceed.

THE FUNNY YOUNG GENTLEMAN

‘Lizzie Hexam’s friend?’

‘Don’t look at him!’ said my aunt, as I turned my head indignantly, ‘but
get me a coach, my dear, and wait for me in St. Paul’s Churchyard.’

III.   The Shadow

‘Edmund, Edmund, you would wear out a Saint. Am I not expressly speaking
of my poor uncle?’

THE IVY GREEN

Arthur being far too ill to be spoken with on subjects of emotion or
anxiety, and his recovery greatly depending on the repose into which
his weakness could be hushed, Little Dorrit’s sole reliance during this
heavy period was on Mr Meagles. He was still abroad; but she had written
to him through his daughter, immediately after first seeing Arthur in
the Marshalsea and since, confiding her uneasiness to him on the points
on which she was most anxious, but especially on one. To that one,
the continued absence of Mr Meagles abroad, instead of his comforting
presence in the Marshalsea, was referable.

‘Perfecté,’ replied Sir Norfolk coolly. But he did not on that account
accelerate his movements.

Mr. Bucket, supporting me with his arm, lowered me gently into my
chair. “Cheer up! Don’t think me hard with you, my dear, but as soon
as ever you feel equal to it, get your shoes on and be ready.”

‘A matter of good five mile, my dear,’ was the reply, ‘but you’re not
going on to-night?’

‘A quotation from one of his speeches, when a lad at Dublin University,
proves the early political bias of his mind. After a brilliant eulogy
on the French republic, he concluded with a remark sufficiently
expressive:--“When a people, advancing rapidly in knowledge and power,
perceive at last how far their government is lagging behind them, what
then, I ask, is to be done in such a case? Why, _pull the government up
to the people!_” The consequences of indulging in such language at
such a time may be imagined--Emmett was struck off the College
roll.’--_Memoir of Robert Emmett._

"Monsieur, she is a very pretty child," returned the Corporal, with a
stress on his polite correction of the phrase.

This was my thought as I walked the dock-quays at Liverpool, keeping
watch on poor Mercantile Jack.  Alas for me!  I have long outgrown the
state of sweet little cherub; but there I was, and there Mercantile Jack
was, and very busy he was, and very cold he was: the snow yet lying in
the frozen furrows of the land, and the north-east winds snipping off the
tops of the little waves in the Mersey, and rolling them into hailstones
to pelt him with.  Mercantile Jack was hard at it, in the hard weather:
as he mostly is in all weathers, poor Jack.  He was girded to ships’
masts and funnels of steamers, like a forester to a great oak, scraping
and painting; he was lying out on yards, furling sails that tried to beat
him off; he was dimly discernible up in a world of giant cobwebs, reefing
and splicing; he was faintly audible down in holds, stowing and
unshipping cargo; he was winding round and round at capstans melodious,
monotonous, and drunk; he was of a diabolical aspect, with coaling for
the Antipodes; he was washing decks barefoot, with the breast of his red
shirt open to the blast, though it was sharper than the knife in his
leathern girdle; he was looking over bulwarks, all eyes and hair; he was
standing by at the shoot of the Cunard steamer, off to-morrow, as the
stocks in trade of several butchers, poulterers, and fishmongers, poured
down into the ice-house; he was coming aboard of other vessels, with his
kit in a tarpaulin bag, attended by plunderers to the very last moment of
his shore-going existence.  As though his senses, when released from the
uproar of the elements, were under obligation to be confused by other
turmoil, there was a rattling of wheels, a clattering of hoofs, a
clashing of iron, a jolting of cotton and hides and casks and timber, an
incessant deafening disturbance on the quays, that was the very madness
of sound.  And as, in the midst of it, he stood swaying about, with his
hair blown all manner of wild ways, rather crazedly taking leave of his
plunderers, all the rigging in the docks was shrill in the wind, and
every little steamer coming and going across the Mersey was sharp in its
blowing off, and every buoy in the river bobbed spitefully up and down,
as if there were a general taunting chorus of ‘Come along, Mercantile
Jack!  Ill-lodged, ill-fed, ill-used, hocussed, entrapped, anticipated,
cleaned out.  Come along, Poor Mercantile Jack, and be tempest-tossed
till you are drowned!’

“Thereabouts, I suppose, Sir,” answered Toodle, after more reflection

Mr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched
the piano by which he was seated.

This occupation was, to take down from the shelves of a worm-eaten
wardrobe a quantity of frouzy garments, one by one; to subject each to
a careful and minute inspection by holding it up against the light, and
after folding it with great exactness, to lay it on one or other of
two little heaps beside him. He never took two articles of clothing out
together, but always brought them forth, singly, and never failed to
shut the wardrobe door, and turn the key, between each visit to its
shelves.

"What!" repeated Charley Bates.

The ground most commonly taken by these better men among the advocates of
slavery, is this: ‘It is a bad system; and for myself I would willingly
get rid of it, if I could; most willingly.  But it is not so bad, as you
in England take it to be.  You are deceived by the representations of the
emancipationists.  The greater part of my slaves are much attached to me.
You will say that I do not allow them to be severely treated; but I will
put it to you whether you believe that it can be a general practice to
treat them inhumanly, when it would impair their value, and would be
obviously against the interests of their masters.’

‘Hearts,’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!’

‘If he hasn’t been,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, ‘and got, from somewhere or
other, a couple of roots of those flowers that I said I was so fond of,
the other night, and asked you if you were not--no, that YOU said YOU
were so fond of, the other night, and asked me if I wasn’t--it’s the
same thing. Now, upon my word, I take that as very kind and attentive
indeed! I don’t see,’ added Mrs. Nickleby, looking narrowly about her,
‘any of them on my side, but I suppose they grow best near the gravel.
You may depend upon it they do, Kate, and that’s the reason they are all
near you, and he has put the gravel there, because it’s the sunny side.
Upon my word, that’s very clever now! I shouldn’t have had half as much
thought myself!’

‘No, I don’t, Pa, for I like to have you all to myself to-day. I was
always your little favourite at home, and you were always mine. We have
run away together often, before now; haven’t we, Pa?’

We made our journey through an incessant snowstorm on Wednesday night;
at last got snowed up among the Welsh mountains in a tremendous storm of
wind, came to a stop, and had to dig the engine out. We went to bed at
Holyhead at six in the morning of Thursday, and got aboard the packet at
two yesterday afternoon. It blew hard, but as the wind was right astern,
we only rolled and did not pitch much. As I walked about on the bridge
all the four hours, and had cold salt beef and biscuit there and
brandy-and-water, you will infer that my Channel training has not worn
out.

.        .        .        .        .

Rendered giddy enough by these things, Messieurs Idle and Goodchild
repaired to the quarters they had secured beforehand, and Mr. Goodchild
looked down from the window into the surging street.

Your kind invitation to me to come and see you and yours, and hear the
nightingales, I shall not fail to discuss with Forster, and with an eye
to spring. I expect to see him presently; the rather as I found a note
from him when I came back yesterday, describing himself somewhat
gloomily as not having been well, and as feeling a little out of heart.

"Do you think so?" returned Traddles. "Really? Perhaps he was, rather.
But it's all over, a long while. Old Creakle!"

‘You’ve two,’ said Riderhood.

‘I believe, Mr. Snitchey,’ said Alfred, ‘there are quiet victories and
struggles, great sacrifices of self, and noble acts of heroism, in
it—even in many of its apparent lightnesses and contradictions—not the
less difficult to achieve, because they have no earthly chronicle or
audience—done every day in nooks and corners, and in little households,
and in men’s and women’s hearts—any one of which might reconcile the
sternest man to such a world, and fill him with belief and hope in it,
though two-fourths of its people were at war, and another fourth at law;
and that’s a bold word.’

"It is _just_ the very thing," observed the other.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT

“Blest if she ain’t in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more and
more disturbed. “Wot can she have been a takin’, to keep her courage up?
Hark! There’s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?”

"But I see it," said the Ghost, "notwithstanding."

As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading
murmur came rushing along.

Having divested himself of this encumbrance, Mr. Weller gave his body a
sudden wrench to one side, and by a dexterous twist, contrived to get
his right hand into a most capacious pocket, from whence, after a great
deal of panting and exertion, he extricated a pocket-book of the large
octavo size, fastened by a huge leathern strap. From this ledger he drew
forth a couple of whiplashes, three or four buckles, a little sample-bag
of corn, and, finally, a small roll of very dirty bank-notes, from which
he selected the required amount, which he handed over to Sam.

“Do what, Ma dear?”

"No," returned the child quietly, "they are grandfather's."

“We are going to have some music, Mr Dombey, I hope?” said Cleopatra.

‘I wish,’ said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, ‘that you had picked
out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not
come here, my fine feller.’

MY DEAR MR. RUSSELL STURGIS,

‘And dreams,’ said Tigg, ‘and cries out in an ugly manner; and when the
candle burns down in the night, is in an agony; and all that sort of
thing. I see!’

_Charles Cheeryble._

Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle
for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to
what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.
Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be
equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the
Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived
the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman
said, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise and
propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure
that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to
this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.

"Stop half a moment," said the captain.  "We want a name here.  You could
ask Tregarthen (or if you couldn't I could) what names of old men he
remembers in his time in those diggings?  Hey?"

"Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady," whispered
Sowerberry in the old woman's ear; "we are rather late, and it won't do
to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,--as quick as you like."

‘“It’s off my mind now, Peggotty,” she told me, when I laid her in her
bed that night. “He will believe it more and more, poor fellow, every
day for a few days to come; and then it will be past. I am very tired.
If this is sleep, sit by me while I sleep: don’t leave me. God bless
both my children! God protect and keep my fatherless boy!”

"No, no!" cried Mrs. Gummidge, coming between them, in a fit of crying.
"No, no, Dan'l, not as you are now. Seek her in a little while, my lone
lorn Dan'l, and that'll be but right; but not as you are now. Sit ye
down, and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you,
Dan'l--what have _my_ contrairies ever been to this!--and let us speak a
word about them times when she was first an orphan, and when Ham was
too, and when I was a poor widder woman, and you took me in. It'll
soften your poor heart, Dan'l," laying her head upon his shoulder, "and
you'll bear your sorrow better; for you know the promise, Dan'l, 'As you
have done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto me';
and that can never fail under this roof, that's been our shelter for so
many, many year!"

She had not withdrawn her hand, when the sleeper opened her eyes and
started.

‘Besides,’ said Em’ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles, ‘your
father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father was a
fisherman and my mother was a fisherman’s daughter, and my uncle Dan is
a fisherman.’

I wish I could find in your welcome letter some hint of an intention to
visit England. I can't. I have held it at arm's length, and taken a
bird's-eye view of it, after reading it a great many times, but there is
no greater encouragement in it this way than on a microscopic
inspection. I should love to go with you--as I have gone, God knows how
often--into Little Britain, and Eastcheap, and Green Arbour Court, and
Westminster Abbey. I should like to travel with you, outside the last of
the coaches down to Bracebridge Hall. It would make my heart glad to
compare notes with you about that shabby gentleman in the oilcloth hat
and red nose, who sat in the nine-cornered back-parlour of the Masons'
Arms; and about Robert Preston and the tallow-chandler's widow, whose
sitting-room is second nature to me; and about all those delightful
places and people that I used to walk about and dream of in the daytime,
when a very small and not over-particularly-taken-care-of boy. I have a
good deal to say, too, about that dashing Alonzo de Ojeda, that you
can't help being fonder of than you ought to be; and much to hear
concerning Moorish legend, and poor unhappy Boabdil. Diedrich
Knickerbocker I have worn to death in my pocket, and yet I should show
you his mutilated carcass with a joy past all expression.

Then, I should ride, I said. I could not have come through Canterbury
today without stopping, if I had been coming to anyone but her.

May uttered no word, good or bad, but sat quite still, with her eyes
cast down, and made no sign of interest in what had passed. The good
lady her mother now interposed, observing, in the first instance, that
girls were girls, and bygones bygones, and that, so long as young people
were young and thoughtless, they would probably conduct themselves like
young and thoughtless persons: with two or three other positions of a no
less sound and incontrovertible character. She then remarked, in a
devout spirit, that she thanked Heaven she had always found in her
daughter May a dutiful and obedient child: for which she took no credit
to herself, though she had every reason to believe it was entirely owing
to herself. With regard to Mr. Tackleton, she said, That he was in a
moral point of view an undeniable individual, and That he was in an
eligible point of view a son-in-law to be desired, no one in their
senses could doubt. (She was very emphatic here.) With regard to the
family into which he was so soon about, after some solicitation, to be
admitted, she believed Mr. Tackleton knew that, although reduced in
purse, it had some pretensions to gentility; and that if certain
circumstances, not wholly unconnected, she would go so far as to say,
with the Indigo Trade, but to which she would not more particularly
refer, had happened differently, it might perhaps have been in
possession of wealth. She then remarked that she would not allude to the
past, and would not mention that her daughter had for some time rejected
the suit of Mr. Tackleton; and that she would not say a great many other
things which she did say at great length. Finally, she delivered it as
the general result of her observation and experience, that those
marriages in which there was least of what was romantically and sillily
called love, were always the happiest; and that she anticipated the
greatest possible amount of bliss--not rapturous bliss; but the solid,
steady-going article--from the approaching nuptials. She concluded by
informing the company that to-morrow was the day she had lived for
expressly; and that, when it was over, she would desire nothing better
than to be packed up and disposed of in any genteel place of burial.

"And what the devil do you mean," retorted Steerforth, "by putting Mr.
Copperfield into a little loft over a stable?"

“Never mind,” retorted Mr. Bolter; “and don’t yer take liberties with
yer superiors, little boy, or yer’ll find yerself in the wrong shop.”

‘A little earlier. Her time is half past eight.’ ‘I assure you, my dear
boy,’ says Traddles, ‘I am almost as pleased as if I were going to
be married myself, to think that this event is coming to such a happy
termination. And really the great friendship and consideration of
personally associating Sophy with the joyful occasion, and inviting
her to be a bridesmaid in conjunction with Miss Wickfield, demands my
warmest thanks. I am extremely sensible of it.’

Very often afterwards, in the midst of their talk, he would break off to
try to understand what it was that the waves were always saying; and
would rise up in his couch to look towards that invisible region far
away.

Mr Nadgett picked out a certain chair from among the rest, and having
planted it in a particular spot, as carefully as if he had been going to
vault over it, placed another chair in front of it; leaving room for his
own legs between them. He then sat down in chair number two, and laid
his pocket-book, very carefully, on chair number one. He then untied the
pocket-book, and hung the string over the back of chair number one. He
then drew both the chairs a little nearer Mr Montague, and opening
the pocket-book spread out its contents. Finally he selected a certain
memorandum from the rest, and held it out to his employer, who, during
the whole of these preliminary ceremonies, had been making violent
efforts to conceal his impatience.

‘When I came here, I respected you and honoured you, and I soon loved
you,’ cried Bella. ‘And now I can’t bear the sight of you. At least, I
don’t know that I ought to go so far as that—only you’re a—you’re a
Monster!’ Having shot this bolt out with a great expenditure of force,
Bella hysterically laughed and cried together.

‘What’s the matter with the boy?’ exclaimed Wardle.

‘What! My father asleep again?’ he cried, as he hung up his hat, and
cast a look at him. ‘Ah! and snoring. Only hear!’

‘Light him down,’ said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. ‘It’s a pity
he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers.
Show him a light.’

‘Well, me, Phib, if you will have it so,’ said Miss Squeers. ‘I must
say, that if she would, she would be all the better for it.’

With this extemporary adaptation of a popular ballad to the distressing
circumstances of his own case, Mr Swiveller folded up the parcel again,
beat it very flat between the palms of his hands, thrust it into his
breast, buttoned his coat over it, and folded his arms upon the whole.

"My time grows short," observed the Spirit. "Quick!"

With these and other expressions of confidence of the like flattering
kind, Mr Dennis gave him a hearty slap on the back, which Hugh was not
slow to return.

Belinda, as I have mentioned, occupied the Picture Room.  We had but
three other chambers: the Corner Room, the Cupboard Room, and the Garden
Room.  My old friend, Jack Governor, “slung his hammock,” as he called
it, in the Corner Room.  I have always regarded Jack as the
finest-looking sailor that ever sailed.  He is gray now, but as handsome
as he was a quarter of a century ago—nay, handsomer.  A portly, cheery,
well-built figure of a broad-shouldered man, with a frank smile, a
brilliant dark eye, and a rich dark eyebrow.  I remember those under
darker hair, and they look all the better for their silver setting.  He
has been wherever his Union namesake flies, has Jack, and I have met old
shipmates of his, away in the Mediterranean and on the other side of the
Atlantic, who have beamed and brightened at the casual mention of his
name, and have cried, “You know Jack Governor?  Then you know a prince of
men!”  That he is!  And so unmistakably a naval officer, that if you were
to meet him coming out of an Esquimaux snow-hut in seal’s skin, you would
be vaguely persuaded he was in full naval uniform.

‘Beast!’ cried Miss Pecksniff, sweeping past him. ‘Augustus! He is
beneath your notice!’ Augustus had been making some faint and sickly
demonstration of shaking his fist. ‘Come away, child,’ screamed Miss
Pecksniff, ‘I command you!’

Mr. Tupman did as he was requested, and the additional stimulus of the
last glass settled his determination.

A little while afterwards, when he appeared to be sinking into
insensibility, she said, in a calm loving voice: ‘Eugene, my dear
husband!’ He immediately answered: ‘There again! You see how you can
recall me!’ And afterwards, when he could not speak, he still answered
by a slight movement of his head upon her bosom.

"You are fairly in for it," said the jolly host. "You must satisfy the
curiosity of these gentlemen, sooner or later; so you had better take
advantage of this favourable opportunity, and do so at once."

‘Curious circumstance about those initials, sir,’ said Mr. Magnus. ‘You
will observe--P.M.--post meridian. In hasty notes to intimate
acquaintance, I sometimes sign myself “Afternoon.” It amuses my friends
very much, Mr. Pickwick.’

The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.

LITTLE DORRIT. 2 vols.

The loving couple were thus loving all the way to Twickenham, but when
we arrived there (by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty
and vicious) they were more playful than ever, for Mrs. Leaver threw
stones at Mr. Leaver, and Mr. Leaver ran after Mrs. Leaver on the
grass, in a most innocent and enchanting manner. At dinner, too, Mr.
Leaver _would_ steal Mrs. Leaver’s tongue, and Mrs. Leaver _would_
retaliate upon Mr. Leaver’s fowl; and when Mrs. Leaver was going to
take some lobster salad, Mr. Leaver wouldn’t let her have any, saying
that it made her ill, and she was always sorry for it afterwards, which
afforded Mrs. Leaver an opportunity of pretending to be cross, and
showing many other prettinesses. But this was merely the smiling
surface of their loves, not the mighty depths of the stream, down to
which the company, to say the truth, dived rather unexpectedly, from
the following accident. It chanced that Mr. Leaver took upon himself to
propose the bachelors who had first originated the notion of that
entertainment, in doing which, he affected to regret that he was no
longer of their body himself, and pretended grievously to lament his
fallen state. This Mrs. Leaver’s feelings could not brook, even in
jest, and consequently, exclaiming aloud, ‘He loves me not, he loves me
not!’ she fell in a very pitiable state into the arms of Mrs. Starling,
and, directly becoming insensible, was conveyed by that lady and her
husband into another room. Presently Mr. Leaver came running back to
know if there was a medical gentleman in company, and as there was, (in
what company is there not?) both Mr. Leaver and the medical gentleman
hurried away together.

At dinner they met again, after a five and twenty mile walk, undertaken
by the males at Wardle’s recommendation, to get rid of the effects of
the wine at breakfast; the poor relations had lain in bed all day, with
the view of attaining the same happy consummation, but, as they had been
unsuccessful, they stopped there. Mr. Weller kept the domestics in a
state of perpetual hilarity; and the fat boy divided his time into small
alternate allotments of eating and sleeping.

But all these diversions are nothing to the subsequent excitement when
grandmamma in a high cap, and slate-coloured silk gown; and grandpapa
with a beautifully plaited shirt-frill, and white neckerchief; seat
themselves on one side of the drawing-room fire, with uncle George’s
children and little cousins innumerable, seated in the front, waiting
the arrival of the expected visitors. Suddenly a hackney-coach is heard
to stop, and uncle George, who has been looking out of the window,
exclaims ‘Here’s Jane!’ on which the children rush to the door, and
helter-skelter down-stairs; and uncle Robert and aunt Jane, and the
dear little baby, and the nurse, and the whole party, are ushered
up-stairs amidst tumultuous shouts of ‘Oh, my!’ from the children, and
frequently repeated warnings not to hurt baby from the nurse. And
grandpapa takes the child, and grandmamma kisses her daughter, and the
confusion of this first entry has scarcely subsided, when some other
aunts and uncles with more cousins arrive, and the grown-up cousins
flirt with each other, and so do the little cousins too, for that
matter, and nothing is to be heard but a confused din of talking,
laughing, and merriment.

After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and
knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can
assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a
good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red
in the face over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and
played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you
might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to
the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been
reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music
sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind;
he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened
to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of
life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to
the sexton's spade that buried Jacob Marley.

In a word, things came to that pass that nearly the whole family sat
down before the Blue Dragon, and formally invested it; and Martin
Chuzzlewit was in a state of siege. But he resisted bravely; refusing
to receive all letters, messages, and parcels; obstinately declining to
treat with anybody; and holding out no hope or promise of capitulation.
Meantime the family forces were perpetually encountering each other
in divers parts of the neighbourhood; and, as no one branch of the
Chuzzlewit tree had ever been known to agree with another within the
memory of man, there was such a skirmishing, and flouting, and snapping
off of heads, in the metaphorical sense of that expression; such a
bandying of words and calling of names; such an upturning of noses and
wrinkling of brows; such a formal interment of good feelings and violent
resurrection of ancient grievances; as had never been known in those
quiet parts since the earliest record of their civilized existence.

He has merely to add, that there has been no _book-making_ in this
case. He has not swelled the quantity of matter, but materially
abridged it. The account of Grimaldi's first courtship may appear
lengthy in its present form; but it has undergone a double and most
comprehensive process of abridgment. The old man was garrulous upon a
subject on which the youth had felt so keenly; and as the feeling did
him honour in both stages of life, the Editor has not had the heart to
reduce it further.

‘Pray tell me, Affery,’ the stranger repeated in his turn, ‘who--ha, ha,
ha!--who is this gentleman?’

CHAPTER X

Slyme looked at him; gave it into his hands; and shook his head.

‘“Don’t be frightened,” said Tom Smart. He slowly drew forth the letter,
and unfolded it. “You won’t scream?” said Tom doubtfully.

A rumour had now got into circulation, too, which diffused a greater
dread all through London, even than these publicly announced intentions
of the rioters, though all men knew that if they were successfully
effected, there must ensue a national bankruptcy and general ruin. It
was said that they meant to throw the gates of Bedlam open, and let all
the madmen loose. This suggested such dreadful images to the people’s
minds, and was indeed an act so fraught with new and unimaginable
horrors in the contemplation, that it beset them more than any loss or
cruelty of which they could foresee the worst, and drove many sane men
nearly mad themselves.

CHAPTER 43 -- HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE FORTUNES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE. MR PECKSNIFF IS EXHIBITED IN THE PLENITUDE OF POWER; AND WIELDS THE SAME WITH FORTITUDE AND MAGNANIMITY

There was a bad fever raging in England at this time, and I am glad to
write that the Queen took it, and the hour of her death came. ‘When I
am dead and my body is opened,’ she said to those around those around
her, ‘ye shall find Calais written on my heart.’ I should have thought,
if anything were written on it, they would have found the words—Jane
Grey, Hooper, Rogers, Ridley, Latimer, Cranmer, and three hundred
people burnt alive within four years of my wicked reign, including
sixty women and forty little children. But it is enough that their
deaths were written in Heaven.

She had repeated the question before I could collect my senses around
me. Then, for the first time it occurred to me that, in the event of my
having no engagement abroad, my landlady meant to invite me! "There will
at least be the two daughters," I whispered to myself; "and after all,
Lucy Matthews is a charming girl, and touches the harp divinely. She has
a very small, pretty hand, I recollect; only her fingers are so
punctured by the needle--and I rather think she bites her nails. No, I
will not even now give up my hope. It was yesterday but a straw--to-day
it is but the thistledown; but I will cling to it to the last moment.
There are still four hours left; they will not dine till six. One
desperate struggle, and the peril is past; let me not be seduced by this
last golden apple, and I may yet win my race." The struggle was made--"I
should not dine at home." This was the only phrase left me, for I could
not say that "I should dine out." Alas! that an event should be at the
same time so doubtful and so desirable. I only begged that if any letter
arrived, it might be brought to me immediately.

XV.

‘Oh yes, I know you very well; too well, perhaps, and perhaps he does
too, and sorry am I that I should have to say it.’

They came, at length, to the poor little town of Brieg, at the foot of
the Simplon.  They came there after dark, but yet could see how dwarfed
men's works and men became with the immense mountains towering over them.
Here they must lie for the night; and here was warmth of fire, and lamp,
and dinner, and wine, and after-conference resounding, with guides and
drivers.  No human creature had come across the Pass for four days.  The
snow above the snow-line was too soft for wheeled carriage, and not hard
enough for sledge.  There was snow in the sky.  There had been snow in
the sky for days past, and the marvel was that it had not fallen, and the
certainty was that it must fall.  No vehicle could cross.  The journey
might be tried on mules, or it might be tried on foot; but the best
guides must be paid danger-price in either case, and that, too, whether
they succeeded in taking the two travellers across, or turned for safety
and brought them back.

But, by the time when I came home to England again, the thing was as
clear as your hand held up before you at noon-day.  There was Californian
gold in the museums and in the goldsmiths' shops, and the very first time
I went upon 'Change, I met a friend of mine (a seafaring man like
myself), with a Californian nugget hanging to his watch-chain.  I handled
it.  It was as like a peeled walnut with bits unevenly broken off here
and there, and then electrotyped all over, as ever I saw anything in my
life.

‘Mrs. Strong,’ I said, ‘there is something within my knowledge, which
I have been earnestly entreated by Doctor Strong to conceal, and have
concealed until tonight. But, I believe the time has come when it would
be mistaken faith and delicacy to conceal it any longer, and when your
appeal absolves me from his injunction.’

‘Oh dear me, dear me!’ sighs Mr Venus, heavily, snuffing the candle,
‘the world that appeared so flowery has ceased to blow! You’re casting
your eye round the shop, Mr Wegg. Let me show you a light. My working
bench. My young man’s bench. A Wice. Tools. Bones, warious. Skulls,
warious. Preserved Indian baby. African ditto. Bottled preparations,
warious. Everything within reach of your hand, in good preservation.
The mouldy ones a-top. What’s in those hampers over them again, I don’t
quite remember. Say, human warious. Cats. Articulated English baby.
Dogs. Ducks. Glass eyes, warious. Mummied bird. Dried cuticle, warious.
Oh, dear me! That’s the general panoramic view.’

The landlady flung a pair of lady's shoes into the yard, and bustled
away.

He appeared so miserable, sitting with his head upon his hand, and I
appeared so unwelcome, that I was going to offer an apology when Mr.
Bucket took the matter on himself.

‘Why, I was rather so, over the water, sir,’ returned Mr Tapley; ‘and
not entirely without credit. But Human Natur’ is in a conspiracy again’
me; I can’t get on. I shall have to leave it in my will, sir, to be
wrote upon my tomb: “He was a man as might have come out strong if he
could have got a chance. But it was denied him.”’

[Picture: The Double Bedded Room, Great White Horse, Ipswich]

I saw, in my aunt’s face, that she began to give way now, and Dora
brightened again, as she saw it too.

‘Without the numbers, sir, that is my name,’ replied the ‘prentice.
‘They are merely intended as directions to the washerwoman, and have no
connection with myself or family. YOUR name, sir,’ said Mr Tappertit,
looking very hard at his nightcap, ‘is Chester, I suppose? You needn’t
pull it off, sir, thank you. I observe E. C. from here. We will take the
rest for granted.’

THE SUITORS OF CIRRHA, AND THE YOUNG LADY; WITH A REFERENCE TO HER PAPA.

‘I hope,’ returned her little friend, with a gravity very unusual in
her, ‘it may. I hope, for the sake of that poor lad, it may. However,’
said Miss La Creevy, relapsing into the cheerful, chattering tone, which
was habitual to her, ‘I have said my say, and a very long say it is, and
a very wrong say too, I shouldn’t wonder at all. I shall cheer him up
tonight, at all events, for if he is to be my squire all the way to the
Strand, I shall talk on, and on, and on, and never leave off, till I
have roused him into a laugh at something. So the sooner he goes, the
better for him, and the sooner I go, the better for me, I am sure, or
else I shall have my maid gallivanting with somebody who may rob the
house--though what there is to take away, besides tables and chairs,
I don’t know, except the miniatures: and he is a clever thief who can
dispose of them to any great advantage, for I can’t, I know, and that’s
the honest truth.’

“O, I am such a mite of a thing, and you are so womanly and handsome.
You seem to have resolution and power enough to crush me. I shrink into
nothing by the side of your presence even.”

“Fagin,” said Mr. Brownlow; “what of him?”

BY HEZEKIAH BUTTERWORTH.

"Contented?" he answered, merrily. "I am never contented, except with
your freshness, my gentle Daisy. As to fitfulness, I have never learnt
the art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the Ixions of
these days are turning round and round. I missed it somehow in a bad
apprenticeship, and now don't care about it.--You know I have bought a
boat down here?"

"Sartain!" returned the American. "I guess that we had purty
considerable tough skrimmageing about us. What with the Indians, and the
riglars, and the skinners, and the cow-boys, there warn't no keeping a
beef-cretur in the pen, nor sleeping ten winks at a time. You'd have
thought the devil was let loose."

‘Do they live here?’

"And I have only to add, sir," said Mr. Pickwick, now thoroughly angry,
"that I consider you a rascal, and a--a ruffian--and--and worse than
any man I ever saw, or heard of, except that pious and sanctified
vagabond in the mulberry livery."

Thus directed, Little Dorrit dutifully rose and obeyed: only pausing
for a moment as she went out of the room, to give her sister a kiss of
reconciliation. Upon which, that young lady, feeling much harassed
in her mind, and having for the time worn out the wish with which she
generally relieved it, conceived and executed the brilliant idea of
wishing Old Nandy dead, rather than that he should come bothering there
like a disgusting, tiresome, wicked wretch, and making mischief between
two sisters.

“Put it down,” he said, faintly—“anywhere—for the present.”

IT is nearly eight years since this book was first published.  I present
it, unaltered, in the Cheap Edition; and such of my opinions as it
expresses, are quite unaltered too.

“So, you’re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?” inquired Sikes.

“I don’t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but
only for children’s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in
proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it that it would have a superb
effect.”

‘_Half-past nine_.

Henry of Richmond landed with six thousand men at Milford Haven, and
came on against King Richard, then encamped at Leicester with an army
twice as great, through North Wales. On Bosworth Field the two armies
met; and Richard, looking along Henry’s ranks, and seeing them crowded
with the English nobles who had abandoned him, turned pale when he
beheld the powerful Lord Stanley and his son (whom he had tried hard to
retain) among them. But, he was as brave as he was wicked, and plunged
into the thickest of the fight. He was riding hither and thither,
laying about him in all directions, when he observed the Earl of
Northumberland—one of his few great allies—to stand inactive, and the
main body of his troops to hesitate. At the same moment, his desperate
glance caught Henry of Richmond among a little group of his knights.
Riding hard at him, and crying ‘Treason!’ he killed his
standard-bearer, fiercely unhorsed another gentleman, and aimed a
powerful stroke at Henry himself, to cut him down. But, Sir William
Stanley parried it as it fell, and before Richard could raise his arm
again, he was borne down in a press of numbers, unhorsed, and killed.
Lord Stanley picked up the crown, all bruised and trampled, and stained
with blood, and put it upon Richmond’s head, amid loud and rejoicing
cries of ‘Long live King Henry!’

It was at this stage of the undertaking that Mr. Pickwick, with many
smiles and various other indications of great self-satisfaction,
produced from one of his coat pockets a dark lantern, with which he had
specially provided himself for the occasion, and the great mechanical
beauty of which he proceeded to explain to Mr. Winkle as they walked
along, to the no small surprise of the few stragglers they met.

There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the
burden was Old Clem.  This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
homage to a patron saint; for I believe Old Clem stood in that relation
towards smiths.  It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem's
respected name.  Thus, you were to hammer boys round--Old Clem!  With a
thump and a sound--Old Clem!  Beat it out, beat it out--Old Clem!  With
a clink for the stout--Old Clem!  Blow the fire, blow the fire--Old
Clem!  Roaring dryer, soaring higher--Old Clem!  One day soon after the
appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the
impatient movement of her fingers, "There, there, there!  Sing!"  I was
surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor.  It
happened so to catch her fancy that, she took it up in a low brooding
voice as if she were singing in her sleep.  After that, it became
customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often
join in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were
three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the
lightest breath of wind.

Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,
looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when
the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by
the foremost of the pursuers.

Nell pointed at hazard towards the west, upon which the man asked if she
meant a certain town which he named.  Nell, to avoid more questions,
said, "Yes, that was the place."

‘D’ye think not?’ said Dick.

Upon the following day at noon, Mrs Jarley established herself behind
the highly-ornamented table, attended by the distinguished effigies
before mentioned, and ordered the doors to be thrown open for the
readmission of a discerning and enlightened public.  But the first
day’s operations were by no means of a successful character, inasmuch
as the general public, though they manifested a lively interest in Mrs
Jarley personally, and such of her waxen satellites as were to be seen
for nothing, were not affected by any impulses moving them to the
payment of sixpence a head.  Thus, notwithstanding that a great many
people continued to stare at the entry and the figures therein
displayed; and remained there with great perseverance, by the hour at a
time, to hear the barrel-organ played and to read the bills; and
notwithstanding that they were kind enough to recommend their friends
to patronise the exhibition in the like manner, until the door-way was
regularly blockaded by half the population of the town, who, when they
went off duty, were relieved by the other half; it was not found that
the treasury was any the richer, or that the prospects of the
establishment were at all encouraging.

‘Mrs Merdle is going to have a great farewell Assembly, dear, and a
dinner before it. She has been expressing her anxiety that you should
return in time. She has invited both you and me to her dinner.’

_Mrs. C._ I'll drink his health for your sake and the day's, not for
his. Long life to him. A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! He'll be
very merry and very happy, I have no doubt.

The glory of the day is on the wane; the full round moon arises bright
and beautiful, like a gigantic pearl from the coral caverns of the
ocean; but there is a sort of sallow mistiness upon the verge of the
western horizon, tinged with vermeil streaks from the last rays of the
setting sun, that produce feelings of an undefined and undefinable
nature: yet there is nothing threatening, for all is delightfully
tranquil; no cloud appears to excite apprehensions, for there is a
smile upon the face of the heavens, and its dimples are reflected on
the surface of the clear waters as assurances of safety. Yet, why are
there many keen and experienced eyes glancing at that sickly aspect of
the west, as if it were something which tells them of sudden squalls,
of whirling hurricanes, like the unnatural flush that gives warning of
approaching fever.

The next morning he began his journey. It was now cold, winter weather:
forcibly recalling to his mind under what circumstances he had first
travelled that road, and how many vicissitudes and changes he had
since undergone. He was alone inside the greater part of the way, and
sometimes, when he had fallen into a doze, and, rousing himself, looked
out of the window, and recognised some place which he well remembered as
having passed, either on his journey down, or in the long walk back
with poor Smike, he could hardly believe but that all which had since
happened had been a dream, and that they were still plodding wearily on
towards London, with the world before them.

“Dombey and Son,” interrupted Paul, who had been tutored early in the
phrase.

Little Dorrit had put his hand to her lips, and would have kneeled to
him, but he gently prevented her, and replaced her in her chair. Her
eyes, and the tones of her voice, had thanked him far better than she
thought. He was not able to say, quite as composedly as usual, ‘There,
Little Dorrit, there, there, there! We will suppose that you did know
this person, and that you might do all this, and that it was all done.
And now tell me, Who am quite another person--who am nothing more than
the friend who begged you to trust him--why you are out at midnight, and
what it is that brings you so far through the streets at this late hour,
my slight, delicate,’ child was on his lips again, ‘Little Dorrit!’

"You may reasonably ask yourselves of what Pickwick was afraid--or why
did he dread the presence of witnesses?  Was he simply beguiling the
lady, as he attempted to beguile that lady at Ipswich, without 'meaning
business,' as the phrase runs.  I must say the Plaintiff had rather
reasonable grounds for assuming that the Defendant _did_ mean business.
But all this is for you, Gentlemen, not for me.

This was the life, and this the history, of Little Dorrit; now going
home upon a dull September evening, observed at a distance by Arthur
Clennam. This was the life, and this the history, of Little Dorrit;
turning at the end of London Bridge, recrossing it, going back again,
passing on to Saint George’s Church, turning back suddenly once more,
and flitting in at the open outer gate and little court-yard of the
Marshalsea.

‘Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,’
rejoined the girl, clinging to him. ‘Bill, dear Bill, you cannot
have the heart to kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only
this one night, for you. You _shall_ have time to think, and save
yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me
off. Bill, Bill, for dear God’s sake, for your own, for mine, stop
before you spill my blood! I have been true to you, upon my guilty
soul I have!’

"Nonsense!" said Allen.

“Release me, then,” said Edith, immoveable in voice, in look, and
bearing, as she had been throughout, “from the chain by which I am
bound. Let me go.”

While we were at breakfast, a letter was delivered to me from my aunt.
As it contained matter on which I thought Steerforth could advise me as
well as any one, and on which I knew I should be delighted to consult
him, I resolved to make it a subject of discussion on our journey home.
For the present we had enough to do, in taking leave of all our friends.
Mr. Barkis was far from being the last among them, in his regret at our
departure; and I believe would even have opened the box again, and
sacrificed another guinea, if it would have kept us eight-and-forty
hours in Yarmouth. Peggotty, and all her family, were full of grief at
our going. The whole house of Omer and Joram turned out to bid us good
bye; and there were so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on
Steerforth, when our portmanteaus went to the coach, that if we had had
the baggage of a regiment with us, we should hardly have wanted porters
to carry it. In a word, we departed to the regret and admiration of all
concerned, and left a great many people very sorry behind us.

"What have you got in that bottle?" said the goblin.

But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
      Assailed the monarch’s high estate;
    (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow
      Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
    And, round about his home, the glory
      That blushed and bloomed
    Is but a dim-remembered story
      Of the old time entombed.

Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When
he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The
look and the action had occupied but an instant.

But exclusive of the same interests which unite us, we have powerful
motives to love and defend you.

“Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry.

[Sidenote: Mr. W. C Macready.]

It has now become matter of history; it is recorded in the Newgate
Calendar; and we wish we could attribute this piece of daring heroism
to Mr. Barker. We regret being compelled to state that it was not
performed by him. Would, for the family credit we could add, that it
was achieved by his brother!

‘Is that you?’ inquired Peg.

‘For Mr. Alfred’s sake,’ said Clemency, with homely earnestness.  ‘Him
that you used to love so dearly, once!’

"Yes," said Joram. "As you said we could make a little trip of it, and
go over together, if it was done, Minnie and me--and you."

“Certainly,” said I. “Don’t wake Miss Clare.”

With which words Trotty, in a breathless state, set the child down
before his daughter in the middle of the floor. The little visitor
looked once at Meg; and doubting nothing in that face, but trusting
everything she saw there; ran into her arms.

‘How glad should we be!’

‘Certainly.’

When our time came for returning to Bleak House again, we were
punctual to the day and were received with an overpowering welcome. I
was perfectly restored to health and strength, and finding my
housekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room, rang myself in as if
I had been a new year, with a merry little peal. “Once more, duty,
duty, Esther,” said I; “and if you are not overjoyed to do it, more
than cheerfully and contentedly, through anything and everything, you
ought to be. That’s all I have to say to you, my dear!”

‘He speaks French?’ said the surgeon.

He was tender of the very slippers she had been warming, as he put them
on, and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender.

“Where is he now?” at length he asked, in a hoarse voice.

AN ANNIVERSARY OCCASION

They tried him with Mrs General, but he had not the faintest knowledge
of her. Some injurious suspicion lodged itself in his brain, that she
wanted to supplant Mrs Bangham, and that she was given to drinking. He
charged her with it in no measured terms; and was so urgent with his
daughter to go round to the Marshal and entreat him to turn her out,
that she was never reproduced after the first failure.

‘They tell me I must not even mention your name to him for a long, long
time,’ rejoined the child, ‘I dare not; and even if I might, what good
would a kind word do you, Kit?  We shall be very poor.  We shall
scarcely have bread to eat.’

Listen, and I will tell thee
The song Creation sings,
From the humming of bees in the heather,
To the flutter of angels' wings.

Orient wrapped the shawls about the doleful little woman, while Reymund
opened his knapsack for any remnants of lunch that might afford them
consolation. He kindled the fire, too, for the colors were fading away
beneath, and the sky was getting gloomy overhead; and, warmed and
enlivened in the genial light of the briefly crackling blaze, they
forgot that they were lost upon the mountain, and all the possible
horrors of their fate. But to Reymund there were few horrors in it, for
if he died of exposure and starvation there on the bald, pitiless
mountain, it would be with Orient in his arms at last.

“Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”

‘She said so!’ cried the Carrier.  ‘True!’

"Come in, Mr. Copperfield," said Mr. Jorkins. "Come in!"

“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.

The feather of a Bird of Paradise in Mrs. Snitchey's turban, trembled as
if the bird of Paradise were alive again, when she said that doubtless
Mr. Craggs knew. _She_ was never told.

‘Wot! is she so wery fond on you?’ inquired Sam.

So Joey was produced, and shaken hands with, and that became an
Institution.

I had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before,
and had strolled out of the village to read them while my supper was
making ready. Other packets had missed me, and I had received none for a
long time. Beyond a line or two, to say that I was well, and had arrived
at such a place, I had not had fortitude or constancy to write a letter
since I left home.

The housekeeper obstinately repeated, "Please to favour me, sir, by
saying whether you lunch, or dine, in the middle of the day?"

CHAPTER 64

"Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box. Glad to see you, sir."

"No. I was a young boy, and she exasperated me, and I threw a hammer at
her. A promising young angel I must have been!"

‘I hope it hasn’t got any fevers or anything of that sort in it,’ said
Dick, sitting himself down discontentedly, between Mr Sampson and the
chaste Sally.  ‘One of the legs is longer than the others.’

Here they parted: the neighbour's family went home in a hackney-coach,
and Grimaldi, bidding them good-bye, walked away to Gracechurch-street,
not forgetting to thank the young lady for her humanity and compassion.

‘Did you say, sir, that you were detained also?’

"Thankee, sir. You won't forget, sir?" said Sam.

‘I examined the newspapers every day for tidings that I was missing, but
saw none. Going out that night to walk (for I kept retired while it was
light), I found a crowd assembled round a placard posted at Whitehall.
It described myself, John Harmon, as found dead and mutilated in the
river under circumstances of strong suspicion, described my dress,
described the papers in my pockets, and stated where I was lying for
recognition. In a wild incautious way I hurried there, and there—with
the horror of the death I had escaped, before my eyes in its most
appalling shape, added to the inconceivable horror tormenting me at
that time when the poisonous stuff was strongest on me—I perceived that
Radfoot had been murdered by some unknown hands for the money for which
he would have murdered me, and that probably we had both been shot into
the river from the same dark place into the same dark tide, when the
stream ran deep and strong.

The worst object of the Earl of Essex, and some friends of his who used
to meet at Lord Southampton’s house, was to obtain possession of the
Queen, and oblige her by force to dismiss her ministers and change her
favourites. On Saturday the seventh of February, one thousand six
hundred and one, the council suspecting this, summoned the Earl to come
before them. He, pretending to be ill, declined; it was then settled
among his friends, that as the next day would be Sunday, when many of
the citizens usually assembled at the Cross by St. Paul’s Cathedral, he
should make one bold effort to induce them to rise and follow him to
the Palace.

"Ding, dong!"

"Oh, thank God, all who see it, for that older
        fashion yet, of immortality!"

What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no
ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that
not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.

‘You will decide quickly,’ said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness
and composure. ‘If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and
consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can,
with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for
you know the way. If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the
mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a
word, in that chair. It has waited for you two whole days.’

‘The men were concealed in a lower chamber,’ said Randulph.

Mr Dennis, who had been bred and nurtured in the good old school, and
had administered the good old laws on the good old plan, always once
and sometimes twice every six weeks, for a long time, bore these appeals
with a deal of philosophy. Being at last, however, rather disturbed in
his pleasant reflection by their repetition, he rapped at one of the
doors with his stick, and cried:

I looked up, and the specters had vanished.  The sky was tinged
with sulphurous hues, the red and the black intermixed.  I
replenished the lamps and the ring in front, thriftily, heedfully;
but when I came to the sixth lamp, not a drop in the vessel that
fed them was left.  In a vague dismay, I now looked round the half
of the wide circle in rear of the two bended figures intent on the
caldron.  All along that disk the light was already broken, here
and there flickering up, here and there dying down; the six lamps
in that half of the circle still twinkled, but faintly, as stars
shrinking fast from the dawn of day.  But it was not the fading
shine in that half of the magical ring which daunted my eye and
quickened with terror the pulse of my heart; the Bush-land beyond
was on fire.  From the background of the forest rose the flame and
the smoke--the smoke, there, still half smothering the flame.  But
along the width of the grasses and herbage, between the verge of
the forest and the bed of the water creek just below the raised
platform from which I beheld the dread conflagration, the fire was
advancing--wave upon wave, clear and red against the columns of
rock behind; as the rush of a flood through the mists of some Alp
crowned with lightnings.

‘Ay?’ said Lord George, looking thoughtfully at him. ‘And you?’

“Yes, dear lady, I will, and tell you true. I’ll tell true, indeed,
Mrs. Snagsby.”

Mr. Tupman said nothing; but he thought of Donna Christina, the stomach
pump, and the fountain; and his eyes filled with tears.

“I hope,” said Mr. Kenge, “that the genial influence of Miss
Summerson,” he bowed to me, “may have induced Mr. Jarndyce,” he bowed
to him, “to forego some little of his animosity towards a cause and
towards a court which are—shall I say, which take their place in the
stately vista of the pillars of our profession?”

Said Mr Podsnap to Mrs Podsnap, ‘Georgiana is almost eighteen.’

“I saw her, in the fire, but now. I hear her in music, in the wind, in
the dead stillness of the night,” returned the haunted man.

And this I know, that the first unpurchasable blessing earned by every
man who makes an effort to improve himself in such a place as the
Athenæum, is self-respect—an inward dignity of character, which, once
acquired and righteously maintained, nothing—no, not the hardest
drudgery, nor the direst poverty—can vanquish.  Though he should find it
hard for a season even to keep the wolf—hunger—from his door, let him but
once have chased the dragon—ignorance—from his hearth, and self-respect
and hope are left him.  You could no more deprive him of those sustaining
qualities by loss or destruction of his worldly goods, than you could, by
plucking out his eyes, take from him an internal consciousness of the
bright glory of the sun.

"I was a little out of humour at the conclusion drawn by Clavijo from
this base fabrication. I reproached him gently for taking such an
unreasonable view of the matter; and, as I found him unwell, I promised
that as soon as he was able to go out, we should go everywhere together,
and that I should make it appear that I looked upon him as a brother and
an honourable man.

Ma’amselle was a little slow to observe it, as though she were not yet
well accustomed to the French tongue. Mrs General, however, observed it
for her.

‘The ladies want you not to say anything to the old gentleman about the
young gentleman having been upstairs; and I want you too.’

Mr. Dawkin’s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the
comforts which his patron’s interest obtained for those whom he took
under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute
mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate
friends he was better known by the sobriquet of ‘The Artful Dodger,’
Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the
moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon
him. Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the
good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if
he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he
should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.

‘But think how cheerful and how happy you have been, Bertha!  How good,
and how much loved, by many people.’

"And who do you want it for?" repeated the postmaster.

The light was a lamp, and the bearer was an old woman: very dirty, very
wrinkled and dry. ‘She’s at home,’ she said (and the voice was the same
that had spoken before); ‘she’ll come directly.’ Having set the lamp
down on the table, the old woman dusted her hands on her apron, which
she might have done for ever without cleaning them, looked at the
visitors with a dim pair of eyes, and backed out.

The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver’s not expressing any greater
curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt
very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of
Fagin’s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries
just then. He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly
and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad.

An ancient English Cathedral Tower? How can the ancient English
Cathedral tower be here! The well-known massive gray square tower of
its old Cathedral? How can that be here! There is no spike of rusty
iron in the air, between the eye and it, from any point of the real
prospect. What is the spike that intervenes, and who has set it up?
Maybe it is set up by the Sultan’s orders for the impaling of a horde
of Turkish robbers, one by one. It is so, for cymbals clash, and the
Sultan goes by to his palace in long procession. Ten thousand scimitars
flash in the sunlight, and thrice ten thousand dancing-girls strew
flowers. Then, follow white elephants caparisoned in countless gorgeous
colours, and infinite in number and attendants. Still the Cathedral
Tower rises in the background, where it cannot be, and still no
writhing figure is on the grim spike. Stay! Is the spike so low a thing
as the rusty spike on the top of a post of an old bedstead that has
tumbled all awry? Some vague period of drowsy laughter must be devoted
to the consideration of this possibility.

“‘Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I
recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,
and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,
and not spoken of.’

‘If you will come back to it, Thomas,’ said Mr Pecksniff, with an icy
look, ‘I shall feel obliged.’

"Go down stairs, Evelina," said I, "and leave Darby and me alone!"

"During the whole of this time, and when the poor creature often bore
about her marks of ill-usage and violence which she could not wholly
conceal, she was a constant attendant at our little church. Regularly
every Sunday, morning and afternoon, she occupied the same seat with
the boy at her side; and though they were both poorly dressed--much
more so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station--they
were always neat and clean. Every one had a friendly nod and a kind
word for 'poor Mrs. Edmunds'; and sometimes, when she stopped to
exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service
in the little row of elm trees which leads to the church porch, or
lingered behind to gaze with a mother's pride and fondness upon her
healthy boy, as he sported before her with some little companions,
her care-worn face would lighten up with an expression of heartfelt
gratitude; and she would look, if not cheerful and happy, at least
tranquil and contented.

‘Oh, the man--the man--behind the door!’ screamed Miss Smithers.

“My dear Jack,
“Ever your most affectionate,
“EDWIN DROOD.

It appeared on the whole, to Little Dorrit herself, that this same
society in which they lived, greatly resembled a superior sort of
Marshalsea. Numbers of people seemed to come abroad, pretty much
as people had come into the prison; through debt, through idleness,
relationship, curiosity, and general unfitness for getting on at home.
They were brought into these foreign towns in the custody of couriers
and local followers, just as the debtors had been brought into the
prison. They prowled about the churches and picture-galleries, much in
the old, dreary, prison-yard manner. They were usually going away again
to-morrow or next week, and rarely knew their own minds, and seldom did
what they said they would do, or went where they said they would go: in
all this again, very like the prison debtors. They paid high for poor
accommodation, and disparaged a place while they pretended to like it:
which was exactly the Marshalsea custom. They were envied when they went
away by people left behind, feigning not to want to go: and that again
was the Marshalsea habit invariably. A certain set of words and phrases,
as much belonging to tourists as the College and the Snuggery belonged
to the jail, was always in their mouths. They had precisely the same
incapacity for settling down to anything, as the prisoners used to have;
they rather deteriorated one another, as the prisoners used to do; and
they wore untidy dresses, and fell into a slouching way of life: still,
always like the people in the Marshalsea.

Wellington, Duke of, 2, 10, 11, _et sæpe_.

At last the Miss Willises’ door opened; the door of the first
glass-coach did the same. Two gentlemen, and a pair of ladies to
correspond—friends of the family, no doubt; up went the steps, bang
went the door, off went the first class-coach, and up came the second.

“The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we
will call--Blacksmith’s work, Blacksmith’s work. We will say, to put a
case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him?”

“Bow to the board,” said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears
that were lingering in his eyes, and seeing no board but the table,
fortunately bowed to that.

“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the same
luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”

While we were thus engaged, I revolved in my mind a hundred different
explanations of the riddle and rejected them every one. I really felt
ashamed to take advantage of the ingenuousness or grateful feeling of
the child for the purpose of gratifying my curiosity. I love these
little people; and it is not a slight thing when they, who are so fresh
from God, love us. As I had felt pleased at first by her confidence I
determined to deserve it, and to do credit to the nature which had
prompted her to repose it in me.

The Joyous Story of Toto, by L. E. Richards.

A glow of delight shone over the old man's wasted face, like the last
rays of the sunlight over a winter landscape. He half arose upon his
elbow, and leaned forward as if trying to see the speaker.

A good many fingers pointed at me, and a good many voices cried “He
does!”  For it was the year when you were all away; and rather low I was
about it, I can tell you.

‘I’ll come anywhere you like,’ said Steerforth, ‘or do anything you
like. Tell me where to come to; and in two hours I’ll produce myself in
any state you please, sentimental or comical.’

It is my intention constantly to address my readers from the
chimney-corner, and I would fain hope that such accounts as I shall give
them of our histories and proceedings, our quiet speculations or more
busy adventures, will never be unwelcome.  Lest, however, I should grow
prolix in the outset by lingering too long upon our little association,
confounding the enthusiasm with which I regard this chief happiness of my
life with that minor degree of interest which those to whom I address
myself may be supposed to feel for it, I have deemed it expedient to
break off as they have seen.

Having uttered these words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone,
to the immeasurable delight of her hearers, Miss Nancy paused, winked
to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.

"Not quite," replied Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.

_11, HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT GARDEN, W.C._
                    (_Late 193, Piccadilly, W._)

I wonder why metropolitan gales always blow so hard at Walworth.  I
cannot imagine what Walworth has done, to bring such windy punishment
upon itself, as I never fail to find recorded in the newspapers when the
wind has blown at all hard.  Brixton seems to have something on its
conscience; Peckham suffers more than a virtuous Peckham might be
supposed to deserve; the howling neighbourhood of Deptford figures
largely in the accounts of the ingenious gentlemen who are out in every
wind that blows, and to whom it is an ill high wind that blows no good;
but, there can hardly be any Walworth left by this time.  It must surely
be blown away.  I have read of more chimney-stacks and house-copings
coming down with terrific smashes at Walworth, and of more sacred
edifices being nearly (not quite) blown out to sea from the same accursed
locality, than I have read of practised thieves with the appearance and
manners of gentlemen—a popular phenomenon which never existed on earth
out of fiction and a police report.  Again: I wonder why people are
always blown into the Surrey Canal, and into no other piece of water!
Why do people get up early and go out in groups, to be blown into the
Surrey Canal?  Do they say to one another, ‘Welcome death, so that we get
into the newspapers’?  Even that would be an insufficient explanation,
because even then they might sometimes put themselves in the way of being
blown into the Regent’s Canal, instead of always saddling Surrey for the
field.  Some nameless policeman, too, is constantly, on the slightest
provocation, getting himself blown into this same Surrey Canal.  Will SIR
RICHARD MAYNE see to it, and restrain that weak-minded and feeble-bodied
constable?

‘Blessings on you, dearest Mr Fledgeby!’

‘Will you speak?’ thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that
his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.

‘I have no appetite now,’ said Newman, putting the flask in his pocket.
‘I’ve had MY dinner.’

"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral," said the same
speaker; "for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go
to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?"

‘Why, you don’t mean to say, you’d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,’
said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.

The deputy shepherd seemed by no means best pleased with Sam's arrival;
and when the first effervescence of the compliment had subsided, even
Mrs. Weller looked as if she could have spared him without the smallest
inconvenience. However, there he was; and as he couldn't be decently
turned out, they all three sat down to tea.

*I.  MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTIONS*

She had quitted the place to which they were travelling, directly after
the event which had changed her whole existence; and for two-and-twenty
years had never had courage to revisit it. It was her native village.
How many recollections crowded on her mind when it appeared in sight!

‘I think so, sir,’ said Bounderby, with a defiant nod.  ‘I think so.  But
there are more of ’em in it.  There’s an old woman.  One never hears of
these things till the mischief’s done; all sorts of defects are found out
in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there’s an old woman turns
up now.  An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a
broomstick, every now and then.  _She_ watches the place a whole day
before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals
away with him and holds a council with him—I suppose, to make her report
on going off duty, and be damned to her.’

Again the staring figures turned upon him all at once, and seemed to
say, "Is this the wife who has forsaken you?"

‘I never thought,’ said Mrs. Micawber, when she came up, twin and all,
to show me the apartment, and sat down to take breath, ‘before I was
married, when I lived with papa and mama, that I should ever find it
necessary to take a lodger. But Mr. Micawber being in difficulties, all
considerations of private feeling must give way.’

Here the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation, while
another clerk, who was mixing a Seidlitz powder, under cover of the lid
of his desk, laughed approvingly.

This gossip, if old Walter heard,
He checked it with a scornful word:
I never durst such tales repeat;
He was too serious and discreet
To speak of what his lord might do;
Besides, he loved my lady too.
And many a time, I recollect,
They were together in the wood;
He, with an air of grave respect,
And earnest look, uncovered stood.
And though their speech I never heard,
(Save now and then a louder word,)
I saw he spake as none but one
She loved and trusted, durst have done;
For oft I watched them in the shade
That the close forest branches made,
Till slanting golden sunbeams came
And smote the fir-trees into flame,
A radiant glory round her lit,
Then down her white robes seemed to flit,
Gilding the brown leaves on the ground,
And all the waving ferns around.
While by some gloomy pine she leant
And he in earnest talk would stand,
I saw the tear-drops, as she bent,
Fall on the flowers in her hand.--
Strange as it seemed and seems to be,
That one so sad, so cold as she,
Could love a little child like me--
Yet so it was.  I never heard
Such tender words as she would say,
And murmurs, sweeter than a word,
Would breathe upon me as I lay.
While I, in smiling joy, would rest,
For hours, my head upon her breast.
Our neighbours said that none could see
In me the common childish charms,
(So grave and still I used to be,)
And yet she held me in her arms,
In a fond clasp, so close, so tight--
I often dream of it at night.
She bade me tell her all--no other
My childish thoughts e'er cared to know:
For I--I never knew my mother;
I was an orphan long ago.
And I could all my fancies pour,
That gentle loving face before.
She liked to hear me tell her all;
How that day I had climbed the tree,
To make the largest fir-cones fall;
And how one day I hoped to be
A sailor on the deep blue sea--
She loved to hear it all!

‘When she was a child,’ he said, lifting up his head soon after we were
left alone, ‘she used to talk to me a deal about the sea, and about
them coasts where the sea got to be dark blue, and to lay a-shining and
a-shining in the sun. I thowt, odd times, as her father being drownded
made her think on it so much. I doen’t know, you see, but maybe she
believed--or hoped--he had drifted out to them parts, where the flowers
is always a-blowing, and the country bright.’

“No word of any kind?”

"The lantern, the spade, and the wicker bottle, were found, that day,
in the churchyard. There were a great many speculations about the
sexton's fate, at first, but it was speedily determined that he had
been carried away by the goblins; and there were not wanting some
very credible witnesses who had distinctly seen him whisked through
the air on the back of a chestnut horse blind of one eye, with the
hind-quarters of a lion, and the tail of a bear. At length all this was
devoutly believed; and the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious,
for a trifling emolument, a good-sized piece of the church weathercock
which had been accidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his
aërial flight, and picked up by himself in the churchyard, a year or
two afterwards.

"Ah! let me see;" and Lord John opened an elegant little note, penned on
a rose-leaf,--at least, in colour and fragrance it resembled one.

His Grandfather and Father--His Birth and first appearance at
        Drury Lane Theatre, and at Sadler's Wells--His Father's
        severity--Miss Farren--The Earl of Derby and the Wig--The
        Fortune-box and Charity's reward--His Father's pretended death,
        and the behaviour of himself and his brother thereupon.

‘No, my love,’ replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. ‘She has
not moved, and will not till we are gone.’

[Sidenote: Miss Hogarth.]

“No,” said Laura, “do not tell him yet, Sally, for you would be sorry to
disappoint him afterwards, if I could not undertake it. Wait a day or
two, and I will give you an answer; or, if possible, it shall be sooner.
Now, thank you for the nice brushing: I will put up my hair while you go
and dress; it is getting late. If you require assistance, and Fanny is
not in your room, tap at my door, for I shall be pleased to help you
to-day.”

‘Oh!’ said Miss Wade, coldly subduing and removing her glance; ‘if you
had any desire to see the place where you led the life from which I
rescued you because you had found out what it was, that is another
thing. But is that your truth to me? Is that your fidelity to me? Is
that the common cause I make with you? You are not worth the confidence
I have placed in you. You are not worth the favour I have shown you. You
are no higher than a spaniel, and had better go back to the people who
did worse than whip you.’

‘I do, my love.’

Feeling my brain going after this, I only trust it with loves from all
to all.

He thought this, and forbore to say another word. With the thought, her
purity and goodness came before him in their brightest light. The little
spot made them the more beautiful.

"Ah!  He need have a eye," said the man.

"And in short, my dear friend," said I, "you feel as blest as you
deserve to feel!"

On our way back, my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted that
the life I was now to lead would make me firm and self-reliant, which
was all I wanted. She repeated this several times next day, in the
intervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes and books
from Mr. Wickfield's; relative to which, and to all my late holiday, I
wrote a long letter to Agnes, of which my aunt took charge, as she was
to leave on the succeeding day. Not to lengthen these particulars, I
need only add, that she made a handsome provision for all my possible
wants during my month of trial; that Steerforth, to my great
disappointment and hers too, did not make his appearance before she went
away; that I saw her safely seated in the Dover coach, exulting in the
coming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys, with Janet at her side; and
that when the coach was gone, I turned my face to the Adelphi, pondering
on the old days when I used to roam about its subterranean arches, and
on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface.

‘That’s my name,’ replied the other.

Meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily. Isabella Wardle and
Mr. Trundle ‘went partners,’ and Emily Wardle and Mr. Snodgrass did the
same; and even Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint-
stock company of fish and flattery. Old Mr. Wardle was in the very
height of his jollity; and he was so funny in his management of the
board, and the old ladies were so sharp after their winnings, that the
whole table was in a perpetual roar of merriment and laughter. There was
one old lady who always had about half a dozen cards to pay for, at
which everybody laughed, regularly every round; and when the old lady
looked cross at having to pay, they laughed louder than ever; on which
the old lady’s face gradually brightened up, till at last she laughed
louder than any of them, Then, when the spinster aunt got ‘matrimony,’
the young ladies laughed afresh, and the Spinster aunt seemed disposed
to be pettish; till, feeling Mr. Tupman squeezing her hand under the
table, she brightened up too, and looked rather knowing, as if matrimony
in reality were not quite so far off as some people thought for;
whereupon everybody laughed again, and especially old Mr. Wardle, who
enjoyed a joke as much as the youngest. As to Mr. Snodgrass, he did
nothing but whisper poetical sentiments into his partner’s ear, which
made one old gentleman facetiously sly, about partnerships at cards and
partnerships for life, and caused the aforesaid old gentleman to make
some remarks thereupon, accompanied with divers winks and chuckles,
which made the company very merry and the old gentleman’s wife
especially so. And Mr. Winkle came out with jokes which are very well
known in town, but are not all known in the country; and as everybody
laughed at them very heartily, and said they were very capital, Mr.
Winkle was in a state of great honour and glory. And the benevolent
clergyman looked pleasantly on; for the happy faces which surrounded the
table made the good old man feel happy too; and though the merriment was
rather boisterous, still it came from the heart and not from the lips;
and this is the right sort of merriment, after all.

Covent Garden re-opened in September; and this year he was in constant
requisition before Christmas, as well as after, Aladdin being found an
extremely profitable piece. "Harlequin and the Swans, or the Bath of
Beauty," was produced at Christmas,[63] and followed at Easter by "Sadak
and Kalasrade," in which Grimaldi played Hassan.

‘Is it not possible,’ said Mr Witherden, after a long pause, ‘that this
note may have found its way into the hat by some accident,--such as
the removal of papers on the desk, for instance?’

I

On the way to this crisis Mr Wegg’s wooden leg had gradually elevated
itself more and more, and he had nudged Mr Venus with his opposite
elbow deeper and deeper, until at length the preservation of his balance
became incompatible with the two actions, and he now dropped over
sideways upon that gentleman, squeezing him against the settle’s edge.
Nor did either of the two, for some few seconds, make any effort to
recover himself; both remaining in a kind of pecuniary swoon.

"Father, jewel! Terence, my only love!" screamed Miss Biddy, over the
staircase. "What is the matter?"--"He wants to be off!" roared the
quartermaster.

“No,” replied the doctor; “of course not! Bless the bright eyes of your
sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any
question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to
them.”

‘Mr Lightwood, me and Mrs Boffin have fixed the sum together, and we
stand to it.’

‘Mr. Slug stated to the section the result of some calculations he had
made with great difficulty and labour, regarding the state of infant
education among the middle classes of London. He found that, within a
circle of three miles from the Elephant and Castle, the following were
the names and numbers of children’s books principally in circulation:—

‘The very thing we say!’ cried Traddles. ‘You see, my dear Copperfield,’
falling again into the low confidential tone, ‘after I had delivered my
argument in DOE dem. JIPES versus WIGZIELL, which did me great service
with the profession, I went down into Devonshire, and had some serious
conversation in private with the Reverend Horace. I dwelt upon the fact
that Sophy--who I do assure you, Copperfield, is the dearest girl!--’

We knew that the voices and oars must come up slowly against the stream;
and our seamen knew, by the set of the stream, under which bank they
would come.  I was put ashore accordingly.  The raft got off well, and I
broke into the wood.

"It's this evil-inclined blue bag," said Clemency, "always tripping up
somebody!"

He threw up his ungrateful and ungracious hand as if it set up a barrier
between them, and flung himself upon his heel and left her. She remained
impassive on the same spot, silent and motionless, until the striking
of the church clock roused her, and she turned away. But then, with the
breaking up of her immobility came the breaking up of the waters that
the cold heart of the selfish boy had frozen. And ‘O that I were lying
here with the dead!’ and ‘O Charley, Charley, that this should be the
end of our pictures in the fire!’ were all the words she said, as she
laid her face in her hands on the stone coping.

But for that resolution so often recalled, Clennam might have wished him
in the crater of Mount Etna, in return for this civility.

“Something old,” said the gentleman. “Take my hat down for a moment
from that peg, will you? No, I don’t want it; look into it. What do you
see written there?”

‘Good-bye, Sir.’

At this moment her brother sauntered into view close by. She darted to
him, and caught him by the hand. Bradley followed, and laid his heavy
hand on the boy’s opposite shoulder.

‘I must, if she is only to be purchased in this way,’ replied Randulph,
in the same tone.

“Hey?” cried the blatant Stryver. “Did he though? Is that the sort of
fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!”

To this, Joe made no answer, but beckoning Hugh, leaped into the saddle
and rode away; and a very stalwart, manly horseman he looked, deserving
a better charger than it was his fortune to bestride. John stood staring
after him, or rather after the grey mare (for he had no eyes for her
rider), until man and beast had been out of sight some twenty minutes,
when he began to think they were gone, and slowly re-entering the house,
fell into a gentle doze.

Mr. Dickens replies:—

It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed
lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there
was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large
moon. In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in
among the piled mountains of cloud.

‘Pray don’t, Edmund! Your habit of interrupting without having the least
thing in the world to say, distracts one. You must be broken of it.
Speaking of Amy;--my poor little pet was devotedly attached to poor
papa, and no doubt will have lamented his loss exceedingly, and grieved
very much. I have done so myself. I have felt it dreadfully. But Amy
will no doubt have felt it even more, from having been on the spot the
whole time, and having been with poor dear papa at the last; which I
unhappily was not.’

‘Oh, come,’ rejoined Mrs. Browdie, disregarding all the endeavours of
her spouse to restrain her, and forcing herself into a front row, ‘don’t
talk such nonsense as that.’

‘Wot are you up to, old feller?’ added Mr Bailey, with the same graceful
rakishness. He was quite the man-about-town of the conversation, while
the easy-shaver was the child.

"Phelim," said I solemnly, "did you hear nothing?"

The haunted man, with his head resting on his hands, replied “I had!”
The Phantom, with an evil smile, drew closer to the chair, and resting
its chin upon its folded hands, its folded hands upon the back, and
looking down into his face with searching eyes, that seemed instinct with
fire, went on:

“Is it as potent as it used to be?”

‘Halloa, friend!’ said Eugene, calling after him, ‘are you blind?’

"Strew thy poppies o'er his head,
      Calm the fever of his mind."

“Yes,” I assented. “I am told it’s very like your Shropshire.”

‘Is it possible, mother,’ her son leaned forward to be the nearer to her
while he whispered it, and laid his hand nervously upon her desk, ‘is
it possible, mother, that he had unhappily wronged any one, and made no
reparation?’

"Oh, come!" cried Grimaldi, "it's not so bad as I thought,--333_l._
13_s._ is not so much among six persons!" which was the number of
proprietors at that time.

As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known
who had died upon the scaffold—some of them through his means. They
rose up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them. He
had seen some of them die,—and joked too, because they died with
prayers upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down;
and how suddenly they changed from strong and vigorous men to dangling
heaps of clothes!

‘I want him to come with me to look after this bracelet and letter,’
answered Joe. ‘Halloa there! Hugh!’

‘Messieurs et Mesdames, I present to you at this Fair, as a mark of my
confidence in the people of this so-renowned town, and as an act of
homage to their good sense and fine taste, the Ventriloquist, the
Ventriloquist!  Further, Messieurs et Mesdames, I present to you the
Face-Maker, the Physiognomist, the great Changer of Countenances, who
transforms the features that Heaven has bestowed upon him into an endless
succession of surprising and extraordinary visages, comprehending,
Messieurs et Mesdames, all the contortions, energetic and expressive, of
which the human face is capable, and all the passions of the human heart,
as Love, Jealousy, Revenge, Hatred, Avarice, Despair!  Hi hi!  Ho ho!  Lu
lu!  Come in!’  To this effect, with an occasional smite upon a sonorous
kind of tambourine—bestowed with a will, as if it represented the people
who won’t come in—holds forth a man of lofty and severe demeanour; a man
in stately uniform, gloomy with the knowledge he possesses of the inner
secrets of the booth.  ‘Come in, come in!  Your opportunity presents
itself to-night; to-morrow it will be gone for ever.  To-morrow morning
by the Express Train the railroad will reclaim the Ventriloquist and the
Face-Maker!  Algeria will reclaim the Ventriloquist and the Face-Maker!
Yes!  For the honour of their country they have accepted propositions of
a magnitude incredible, to appear in Algeria.  See them for the last time
before their departure!  We go to commence on the instant.  Hi hi!  Ho
ho!  Lu lu!  Come in!  Take the money that now ascends, Madame; but after
that, no more, for we commence!  Come in!’

‘It’s the worst of having to do with women,’ said the Jew, replacing
his club; ‘but they’re clever, and we can’t get on, in our line,
without ‘em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.’

WATERLOO HOTEL, EDINBURGH, _Wednesday, April 18th, 1866._

Smike became alarmingly ill; so reduced and exhausted that he could
scarcely move from room to room without assistance; and so worn and
emaciated, that it was painful to look upon him. Nicholas was warned,
by the same medical authority to whom he had at first appealed, that the
last chance and hope of his life depended on his being instantly removed
from London. That part of Devonshire in which Nicholas had been
himself bred was named as the most favourable spot; but this advice was
cautiously coupled with the information, that whoever accompanied
him thither must be prepared for the worst; for every token of rapid
consumption had appeared, and he might never return alive.

Mr. Crisparkle bowed submissively: “It is hard to prejudge his case,
sir, but I am sensible that—”

Whereunto Bella replied, with probably the least successful attempt at
looking matronly that ever was seen: ‘Indeed, I think so, John, dear.’

At the close of the year he went to Leeds, to take the chair at a
meeting of the Mechanics' Institute, and on the 28th December he
presided at the opening of the Glasgow Athenæum; he and his wife being
the guests of the historian--_then_ Mr. Sheriff, afterwards Sir
Archibald Alison. From a letter to his sister-in-law, written from
Edinburgh, it will be seen that Mrs. Dickens was prevented by sudden
illness from being present at the "demonstration." At the end of that
letter there is another illustration of the odd names he was in the
habit of giving to his children, the last of the three, the "Hoshen
Peck," being a corruption of "Ocean Spectre"--a name which had,
afterwards, a sad significance, as the boy (Sydney Smith) became a
sailor, and died and was buried at sea two years after his father's
death.

So we went on. Dora was hardly less affectionate to my aunt than to me,
and often told her of the time when she was afraid she was ‘a cross old
thing’. I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone. She
courted Jip, though Jip never responded; listened, day after day, to the
guitar, though I am afraid she had no taste for music; never attacked
the Incapables, though the temptation must have been severe; went
wonderful distances on foot to purchase, as surprises, any trifles that
she found out Dora wanted; and never came in by the garden, and missed
her from the room, but she would call out, at the foot of the stairs, in
a voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house:

Dolby, George, ii. 245, 252-255, 267, 273, 280, 295, 296, 308, 310,
        311, 317-323, 328, 330, 335, 336, 340, 345-347, 352-360, 363,
        367, 381

‘I shall be stronger, and keep the deadness off better, this way, than
any way left open to me, sir.’

‘It’s light enough for me,’ said Mr Merdle.

‘I wish I could give it to _you_,’ said Tackleton.  ‘As I can’t;
thank’ee.  Between ourselves, (as I told you before, eh?) I don’t much
think I shall have the less joy in my married life, because May hasn’t
been too officious about me, and too demonstrative.  Good bye!  Take care
of yourself.’

‘One thing!’ said I. ‘Martha!’

The doctor came in too, to see how it fared with Johnny. And he and
Rokesmith stood together, looking down with compassion on him.

“It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,” said
Mr. Sikes. “Give him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make
haste! It’s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase
shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.”

When shall I disconnect the combined smells of oranges, brown paper, and
straw, from those other birthdays at school, when the coming hamper casts
its shadow before, and when a week of social harmony—shall I add of
admiring and affectionate popularity—led up to that Institution?  What
noble sentiments were expressed to me in the days before the hamper, what
vows of friendship were sworn to me, what exceedingly old knives were
given me, what generous avowals of having been in the wrong emanated from
else obstinate spirits once enrolled among my enemies!  The birthday of
the potted game and guava jelly, is still made special to me by the noble
conduct of Bully Globson.  Letters from home had mysteriously inquired
whether I should be much surprised and disappointed if among the
treasures in the coming hamper I discovered potted game, and guava jelly
from the Western Indies.  I had mentioned those hints in confidence to a
few friends, and had promised to give away, as I now see reason to
believe, a handsome covey of partridges potted, and about a hundredweight
of guava jelly.  It was now that Globson, Bully no more, sought me out in
the playground.  He was a big fat boy, with a big fat head and a big fat
fist, and at the beginning of that Half had raised such a bump on my
forehead that I couldn’t get my hat of state on, to go to church.  He
said that after an interval of cool reflection (four months) he now felt
this blow to have been an error of judgment, and that he wished to
apologise for the same.  Not only that, but holding down his big head
between his two big hands in order that I might reach it conveniently, he
requested me, as an act of justice which would appease his awakened
conscience, to raise a retributive bump upon it, in the presence of
witnesses.  This handsome proposal I modestly declined, and he then
embraced me, and we walked away conversing.  We conversed respecting the
West India Islands, and, in the pursuit of knowledge he asked me with
much interest whether in the course of my reading I had met with any
reliable description of the mode of manufacturing guava jelly; or whether
I had ever happened to taste that conserve, which he had been given to
understand was of rare excellence.

“Not proper!” said Rosa, flushing to her temples, “what monstrous
ideas! What impropriety can there be in a party of young people amusing
themselves with dancing or anything else convenable?”

It appears to me that the first question in reference to my reading (I
have not advanced an inch in my "Copperfield" trials by-the-bye) is,
whether you think you could devise any plan in connection with the room
at Dee's, which would certainly bring my help in money up to five
hundred pounds. That is what I want. If it could be done by a
subscription for two nights, for instance, I would not be chary of my
time and trouble. But if you cannot see your way clearly to that result
in that connection, then I think it would be better to wait until we can
have the Town Hall at Christmas. I have promised to read, about
Christmas time, at Sheffield and at Peterboro'. I _could_ add Birmingham
to the list, then, if need were. But what I want is, to give the
institution in all five hundred pounds. That is my object, and nothing
less will satisfy me.

“You can be when you choose?”

‘I suppose, Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, his indignation rising while he
spoke--‘I suppose, Sir, that it is the intention of your employers to
seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends?’

Mrs. Guppy, whose incessant smiling gave her quite a waggish
appearance, did as her son requested and then sat down in a corner,
holding her pocket handkerchief to her chest, like a fomentation,
with both hands.

After the delivery of which expressions, he retired again.

He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death.  Above all the
noise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying out--I
heard my mother crying out--and Peggotty.  Then he was gone; and the
door was locked outside; and I was lying, torn and sore and raging, upon
the floor.

‘Slap through the town,’ whispered Sikes; ‘there’ll be nobody in the
way, to-night, to see us.’

This would not do, it was quite clear. I was flying too high, and should
never get on, so. I resorted to Traddles for advice; who suggested that
he should dictate speeches to me, at a pace, and with occasional
stoppages, adapted to my weakness. Very grateful for this friendly aid,
I accepted the proposal; and night after night, almost every night, for
a long time, we had a sort of private Parliament in Buckingham Street,
after I came home from the Doctor's.

"What do you mean," said the tinker, "by wearing my brother's silk
hankercher? Give it over here!" And he had mine off my neck in a moment,
and tossed it to the woman.

‘Are you sure, Sam?’ said Mr. Pickwick.

_Russia_, s.s., the, 249, 276

‘So I _do_ do as she bids me,’ replied Mr. Chitling; ‘I shouldn’t
have been milled, if it hadn’t been for her advice. But it turned
out a good job for you; didn’t it, Fagin! And what’s six weeks of
it? It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter
time when you don’t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?’

Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up. She took out an old
black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes; but instead of putting it in
her pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, and still kept it out,
ready for use.

She was scared at first, but seemed to take courage while he spoke to
her.

VIII.
    The veteran rush'd sword in hand on the foe,
    And cut him in two with a desperate blow.
    His master exclaim'd, "I'm delighted to see
    How neatly you've settled the humble-bee!"
                          The humble-bee--
    So there was an end of the humble-bee.

It was only for a moment, however, that Joe forgot himself, for speedily
reviving he thrust his drowsy father aside--to Mr Willet’s mighty and
inexpressible indignation--and darting out, stood ready to help them to
alight. It was necessary for Dolly to get out first. Joe had her in his
arms;--yes, though for a space of time no longer than you could count
one in, Joe had her in his arms. Here was a glimpse of happiness!

"Peggotty," says I, suddenly, "were you ever married?"

"Than whom," said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, "no more
sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined."

‘None o’ wot?’ inquired Mr. Weller.

I, from that rich plain was gazing
Towards the snowy mountains high,
Who their gleaming peaks were raising
Up against the purple sky.

‘But I want you to know, my love. Put Jip down.’

‘The old gentleman makes him no answer, but climbs up the ladder in a
greater bustle than ever.  Tom looked after his legs till there was
nothing of him left, and then sat down to wait; feeling (so he used to
say) as comfortable as if he was going to be made a freemason, and they
were heating the pokers.

[36] This and following letters to Mr. and Mrs. Cowden Clarke appeared
in a volume entitled "Recollections of Writers."

Living much out of doors, in the sun and wind, will no doubt produce
a certain roughness of character--will cause a thicker cuticle to
grow over some of the finer qualities of our nature, as on the face
and hands, or as severe manual labour robs the hands of some of
their delicacy of touch. So staying in the house, on the other hand,
may produce a softness and smoothness, not to say thinness of skin,
accompanied by an increased sensibility to certain impressions. Perhaps
we should be more susceptible to some influences important to our
intellectual and moral growth if the sun had shone and the wind blown
on us a little less; and no doubt it is a nice matter to proportion
rightly the thick and thin skin. But methinks that is a scurf that
will fall off fast enough--that the natural remedy is to be found in
the proportion which the night bears to the day, the winter to the
summer, thought to experience. There will be so much the more air
and sunshine in our thoughts. The callous palms of the labourer are
conversant with finer tissues of self-respect and heroism, whose touch
thrills the heart, than the languid fingers of idleness. That is mere
sentimentality that lies abed by day and thinks itself white, far from
the tan and callus of experience.

The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an
instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.
That was the only answer he received.

The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,
painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break
the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver
appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to
the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately
admitted into the lodge.

1866.

‘My friend, Doctor Slammer, requested me to add, that he was firmly
persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening, and
possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of. He
commissioned me to say, that should this be pleaded as an excuse for
your behaviour, he will consent to accept a written apology, to be
penned by you, from my dictation.’

The old couple sit side by side, and the old time seems like yesterday
indeed. Looking back upon the path they have travelled, its dust and
ashes disappear; the flowers that withered long ago, show brightly
again upon its borders, and they grow young once more in the youth of
those about them.

PROPPED MY EYELIDS OPEN WITH MY TWO FOREFINGERS AND LOOKED PERSEVERINGLY
AT HER, AS SHE SAT AT WORK--Chap. ii.]

Gone into the deepening night, and howling wind, and pelting rain;
urging her way on towards the mist-enshrouded city where the blurred
lights gleamed; and with her black hair, and disordered head-gear,
fluttering round her reckless face.

[With the “Christmas Carol” and “The Trial from Pickwick,” Mr. Charles
Dickens brought to a brilliant close the memorable series of public
readings which have for sixteen years proved to audiences unexampled in
numbers, the source of the highest intellectual enjoyment.  Every portion
of available space in the building was, of course, last night occupied
some time before the appointed hour; but could the St. James’s Hall have
been specially enlarged for the occasion to the dimensions of Salisbury
Plain, it is doubtful whether sufficient room would even then have been
provided for all anxious to seize the last chance of hearing the
distinguished novelist give his own interpretation of the characters
called into existence by his own creative pen.  As if determined to
convince his auditors that, whatever reason had influenced his
determination, physical exhaustion was not amongst them, Mr. Dickens
never read with greater spirit and energy.  His voice to the last
retained its distinctive clearness, and the transitions of tone, as each
personage in the story, conjured up by a word, rose vividly before the
eye, seemed to be more marvellous than ever.  The vast assemblage, hushed
into breathless attention, suffered not a syllable to escape the ear, and
the rich humour and deep pathos of one of the most delightful books ever
written found once again the fullest appreciation.  The usual burst of
merriment responsive to the blithe description of Bob Cratchit’s
Christmas day, and the wonted sympathy with the crippled child “Tiny
Tim,” found prompt expression, and the general delight at hearing of
Ebenezer Scrooge’s reformation was only checked by the saddening
remembrance that with it the last strain of the “carol” was dying away.
After the “Trial from Pickwick,” in which the speeches of the opposing
counsel, and the owlish gravity of the judge, seemed to be delivered and
depicted with greater dramatic power than ever, the applause of the
audience rang for several minutes through the hall, and when it had
subsided, Mr. Dickens, with evidently strong emotion, but in his usual
distinct and expressive manner, spoke as follows:—]

“Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. “Courage,
courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”

‘Yes,’ said Bella, nodding thoughtfully; ‘I understand. That seems wise,
and considerate.’

A watchful pause.

Nobody, however, volunteered to obey the command; and Mr. Winkle, after
darting a rebellious glance at Mr. Pickwick, reloaded his gun, and
proceeded onwards with the rest.

“That can do little for an unhappy mind,” said I.

Agate, John, ii. 136;
    letter to, ii. 154

“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his
elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing Fool?”

The rider, giving his bridle to one of those who surrounded him,
dismounted, and approached John, hat in hand, but with great haste.

‘No,’ the man assented in a surly way; ‘my letter—it’s wrote by my
daughter, but it’s mine—is about my business, and my business ain’t
nobody else’s business.’

‘Yes,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘yes, I believe you have tried hard; I have
observed you, and I can find no fault in that respect.’

CHAPTER 15 -- THE BURDEN WHEREOF, IS HAIL COLUMBIA!

‘The other one,’ said Mr Jonas, after a pause. ‘Does SHE ever have the
nightmare?’

“Mother! thy gentle hand hath mighty power,
    For thou alone may’st train, and guide, and mould
    Plants that shall blossom, with an odor sweet,
    Or, like the cursed fig-tree, wither, and become
    Vile cumberers of the ground.”

So far as I understand the dinner arrangements here, they are much too
long. As to the acoustics of that hall, and the position of the tables
(both as bad as bad can be), my only consolation is that, if anybody can
be heard, _I_ probably can be. The honorary secretary tells me that six
hundred people are to dine. The mayor, being no speaker and out of
health besides, hands over the toast of the evening to Lord Dufferin.
The town is full of the festival. The Theatre Royal, touched up for the
occasion, will look remarkably bright and well for the readings, and our
lets are large. It is remarkable that our largest let as yet is for
Thursday, not Friday. I infer that the dinner damages Friday, but Dolby
does not think so. There appears to be great curiosity to hear the
"Murder." (On Friday night last I read to two thousand people, and odd
hundreds.)

"Mr. Saville!" repeated the man. "Oh, sir, we have heard that
name mentioned frequently of late. You will come again, or send,
perhaps;--will you not, sir?"

"Two children, each of spell-bound mother,
    Shall meet, and one shall love the other;
    But mother young, and mother old,
    Each the blessing shall withhold.
    When by parent's tooth is child's flesh riven,
    When by child's hand, parent hurl'd from heaven,
    Then shall the serfs with joy be tipsy,
    For then shall the robber espouse the gipsy."

Giovanna witnessed the Count’s emotion with sadness. “To have,” she said
mournfully, “one’s first, pure, ardent, passionate affection
unrequited, scorned, made a jest of, is indeed a bitterness, almost
equal to that of death.”

"We are here, and must go on," said the child boldly.

“Now, I wonder who it can be about?” said I, pretending to consider.

“Pardon! There was the supper! It should be eaten on the instant.
Monsieur (who spoke French like an Angel—or a Frenchman—it was all the
same) had spoken with great emphasis of his punctuality. But the
English nation had so grand a genius for punctuality. Ah! what noise!
Great Heaven, here was Monsieur. Behold him!”

Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.

‘You know I am not, sir,’ replied Mrs. Nickleby.

After a great deal of trouble, and the administration of many slaps on
the head to the infant Kenwigses, whereof two of the most rebellious
were summarily banished, the cloth was laid with much elegance, and a
pair of boiled fowls, a large piece of pork, apple-pie, potatoes and
greens, were served; at sight of which, the worthy Mr. Lillyvick vented a
great many witticisms, and plucked up amazingly: to the immense delight
and satisfaction of the whole body of admirers.

‘Mr. Parsons?’ said the man, looking at the superscription of a note he
held in his hand, and addressing Gabriel with an inquiring air.

‘Pretty well, I thank you, sir. I hope you are the same.’

The head of the Dedlocks has motioned towards a sofa between himself
and my Lady. Mr. Rouncewell quietly takes his seat there.

Contibutor’s Note:

First I complimented Charley on the room, and indeed it was so fresh
and airy, so spotless and neat, that I could scarce believe I had
been lying there so long. This delighted Charley, and her face was
brighter than before.

The travellers’ room at the White Horse Cellar is of course
uncomfortable; it would be no travellers’ room if it were not. It is the
right-hand parlour, into which an aspiring kitchen fireplace appears to
have walked, accompanied by a rebellious poker, tongs, and shovel. It is
divided into boxes, for the solitary confinement of travellers, and is
furnished with a clock, a looking-glass, and a live waiter, which latter
article is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses, in a corner of
the apartment.

Chapter 26

Mr. and Mrs. Snodgrass settled at Dingley Dell, where they purchased
and cultivated a small farm, more for occupation than profit. Mr.
Snodgrass, being occasionally abstracted and melancholy, is to this day
reputed a great poet among his friends and acquaintance, although we
do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief.
There are many celebrated characters, literary, philosophical, and
otherwise, who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure.

“Oh, yes, my dear!” returned Richard. “I’m all right enough.”

‘I was going to say, what on earth do you call it unchristian for?
Which would be most unchristian, Martha--to sit quietly down and let our
houses be sacked by a foreign army, or to turn out like men and drive
‘em off? Shouldn’t I be a nice sort of a Christian, if I crept into
a corner of my own chimney and looked on while a parcel of whiskered
savages bore off Dolly--or you?’

‘In the workhouse,’ he returned.  ‘What are workhouses made for?’

‘Really nothing, my dear,’ said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter,
‘really nothing.’

The three years for which Egerton had taken Sadler's Wells having now
expired, he was requested by the proprietors to state what views he
entertained as to retaining or giving up the property. It being found
impossible to comply with his terms, and a Mr. Williams,[82] who at
that time had the Surrey, having made an offer for the theatre, they
agreed to let it to him for one season. Soon after this agreement was
entered into, Williams called upon Grimaldi one morning upon business,
and in the course of the interview the latter inquired by what plan he
proposed to make both theatres answer.

‘“I have wronged you,” shrieked the old man, falling on his knees, and
clasping his hands together. “Be revenged; take my all, my life; cast me
into the water at your feet, and, if human nature can repress a
struggle, I will die, without stirring hand or foot. Do it, Heyling, do
it, but save my boy; he is so young, Heyling, so young to die!”

You will be interested in knowing that, encouraged by the success of
summer cricket-matches, I got up a quantity of foot-races and rustic
sports in my field here on the 26th last past: as I have never yet had a
case of drunkenness, the landlord of The Falstaff had a drinking-booth
on the ground. All the prizes I gave were in money, too. We had two
thousand people here. Among the crowd were soldiers, navvies, and
labourers of all kinds. Not a stake was pulled up, or a rope slackened,
or one farthing's-worth of damage done. To every competitor (only) a
printed bill of general rules was given, with the concluding words: "Mr.
Dickens puts every man upon his honour to assist in preserving order."
There was not a dispute all day, and they went away at sunset rending
the air with cheers, and leaving every flag on a six hundred yards'
course as neat as they found it when the gates were opened at ten in the
morning. Surely this is a bright sign in the neighbourhood of such a
place as Chatham!

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Tuesday Morning, June 19th, 1855._

The resolution having been communicated throughout the country, and
an hour appointed for the catastrophe, though it had nigh broken the
hearts of some petted ponies and favourites, it was obeyed with all
the stubborn _sted_-fastness of this illustrious creature. Racers and
hunters, coach and cart, high-bred and low, drays and galloways, saddle
and side ditto, Suffolk punches and dogsmeat, cobs and cabs, hacks
and shelties, respectables and rips, old and young, stallions, mares,
geldings, colts, foals, and fillies,--all perished at the same time.
O'Connell's tail was the only one that remained extant in England,
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland; but this our tale hath no reference to
that. It may be inquired by the physiologist what were the means of
death to which the abhorrence of steam induced the horses to resort; and
it is gratifying to be able to satisfy their thirst for knowledge by
stating that they died of the _Vapours_.

I threw off my coat immediately, and, seizing the boy, wrapt him
closely in it.

Glasgow, 270

Little Dorrit opened the door from without, and they both entered. He
was sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap, in the sunlight
by the window, reading his newspaper. His glasses were in his hand, and
he had just looked round; surprised at first, no doubt, by her step upon
the stairs, not expecting her until night; surprised again, by seeing
Arthur Clennam in her company. As they came in, the same unwonted look
in both of them which had already caught attention in the yard below,
struck him. He did not rise or speak, but laid down his glasses and his
newspaper on the table beside him, and looked at them with his mouth
a little open and his lips trembling. When Arthur put out his hand,
he touched it, but not with his usual state; and then he turned to his
daughter, who had sat down close beside him with her hands upon his
shoulder, and looked attentively in her face.

At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the
breakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation,
begged permission to speak with her for a few moments.

Little Dorrit did not say who had taken pains to teach and encourage the
poor half-witted creature, but Mr. Clennem guessed from the name Little
Mother, and the fondness of the poor creature for Amy.

‘Good gracious bless me, how my poor head is vexed and worried by that
girl Jupe’s so perseveringly asking, over and over again, about her
tiresome letters!  Upon my word and honour I seem to be fated, and
destined, and ordained, to live in the midst of things that I am never to
hear the last of.  It really is a most extraordinary circumstance that it
appears as if I never was to hear the last of anything!’

"These--these--are very awkward skates; ain't they, Sam?" inquired Mr.
Winkle, staggering.

In less than another minute she was on her road to the railway, under
Joe’s protection. Joe waited on her when she got there, put her safely
into the railway carriage, and handed in the very little bag after her,
as though it were some enormous trunk, hundredweights heavy, which she
must on no account endeavour to lift.

He had been asked if he came on business, and had answered No; he had
come for the pleasure of seeing me, and had come a long way. He was an
old man, my servant said, and looked like a farmer.

It was not that he looked many years older, though still dressed
with the old scrupulous cleanliness; or that there was an unwholesome
ruddiness upon his face; or that his eyes were full and bloodshot; or
that there was a nervous trembling in his hand, the cause of which I
knew, and had for some years seen at work. It was not that he had lost
his good looks, or his old bearing of a gentleman--for that he had
not--but the thing that struck me most, was, that with the evidences of
his native superiority still upon him, he should submit himself to that
crawling impersonation of meanness, Uriah Heep. The reversal of the
two natures, in their relative positions, Uriah’s of power and Mr.
Wickfield’s of dependence, was a sight more painful to me than I can
express. If I had seen an Ape taking command of a Man, I should hardly
have thought it a more degrading spectacle.

‘I love Amy,’ cried Miss Fanny, sobbing and weeping, ‘as well as I love
my life--better than I love my life. I don’t deserve to be so treated. I
am as grateful to Amy, and as fond of Amy, as it’s possible for any
human being to be. I wish I was dead. I never was so wickedly wronged.
And only because I am anxious for the family credit.’

And then the lady comes back, and explains that Mrs. W. is a widow.

"Nothing can be fairer," observed Mr. Ben Allen.

‘Poor fellow!’ said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the
charity-boy.

The relation of this affecting incident of private life brought master
and man to Mr. Perker’s chambers. Lowten, holding the door half open,
was in conversation with a rustily-clad, miserable-looking man, in boots
without toes and gloves without fingers. There were traces of privation
and suffering--almost of despair--in his lank and care-worn countenance;
he felt his poverty, for he shrank to the dark side of the staircase as
Mr. Pickwick approached.

‘Did you think for me at all, Lizzie?’ he asked, as if he were a little
stung.

We achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to
Doctors’ Commons, and anticipating the distant days when I should be a
proctor there, which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and
whimsical lights, that made us both merry. When we came to our journey’s
end, he went home, engaging to call upon me next day but one; and I
drove to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where I found my aunt up, and waiting
supper.

She won't scratch it out, and quite honourable; because we have made an
understanding that everything is to be taken down, and that nothing that
is once taken down shall be scratched out.  I have the great misfortune
not to be able to read and write, and I am speaking my true and faithful
account of those Adventures, and my lady is writing it, word for word.

‘No offence, I hope,’ returned the old man.

"Marchioness," said Mr. Swiveller, rising, "the word of a gentleman is
as good as his bond--sometimes better; as in the present case, where his
bond might prove but a doubtful sort of security. I am your friend, and
I hope we shall play many more rubbers together in the same saloon. But,
Marchioness," added Richard, stopping on his way to the door, and
wheeling slowly round upon the small servant, who was following with the
candle, "it occurs to me that you must be in the constant habit of
airing your eye at keyholes, to know all this."

She appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there,
and repeating “Hush!” went before us on tiptoe as though even the
sound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said.

"I'm pretty sure of it," said Mr. Britain.

But the very intensity of his purpose became almost a substitute for
action in it. While he was yet uninformed of the traitor’s retreat, it
served to divert his mind from his own calamity, and to entertain it
with another prospect. The brother and sister of his false favourite
had no such relief; everything in their history, past and present, gave
his delinquency a more afflicting meaning to them.

‘Ah, to be sure, my dear,’ replied the Jew.

"I suppose the English of all this is, you want me to take him?" said
the squire.--"Throth, an' your honour, that's just it--if your honour
would be plazed."

I notice the latest piece of poisoning ingenuity in Pritchard's case.
When he had made his medical student boarders sick, by poisoning the
family food, he then quietly walked out, took an emetic, and made
himself sick. This with a view to ask them, in examination on a
possible trial, whether he did not present symptoms at the time like the
rest?--A question naturally asked for him and answered in the
affirmative. From which I get at the fact.

‘I see it all,’ said the Byron-quoter; ‘Simpson marries Julia Maplesone
to-morrow morning!’

My daughter and her aunt declare that they know the true scent of the
true article (which I don't in the least believe), and sometimes they
exclaim, "That's not a Morgan," and the worst of it is they were once
right by accident. . . . I hope you will have seen the Christmas number
of "All the Year Round."[71] Here and there, in the description of the
sea-going hero, I have given a touch or two of remembrance of Somebody
you know; very heartily desiring that thousands of people may have some
faint reflection of the pleasure I have for many years derived from the
contemplation of a most amiable nature and most remarkable man.

THREATENING LETTER TO THOMAS HOOD
FROM AN ANCIENT GENTLEMAN

‘But look at this food before our eyes, if one may so misuse the word,’
said I.  ‘Would any Inspector who did his duty, pass such abomination?’

"Very good, Mr. Nugent," said his lordship; "let them blaze away with
the bow-guns, but be careful not to shot them."

The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,
and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he
looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a
handsome man, not past the prime of life.

‘Good-bye, dearest Pa. Good-bye!’

"Some men are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and others
     with a wooden ladle."--_Ancient Proverb._

‘Sorry, master!’ cried Hugh.

The following list has been compiled from such toys as have delighted
as well as have helped the children of kindergarten-trained mothers.

The old conspiracy to make me happy! Everybody seemed to be in it!

‘Hem!’ said the gentleman. ‘No, I know you’re not. He is not hungry,
Mrs. Bedwin,’ said the gentleman: looking very wise.

I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to
them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I
still lay there.

‘I am not afraid of anything,’ replied the other, whose looks and manner
were in flat contradiction to his words. ‘But we’ll keep together.’

“The present editor of these volumes has felt it necessary to say
    thus much in explanation of their origin.  His own share in them is
    stated in a few words.  Being much struck by several incidents in the
    manuscript—such as the description of Grimaldi’s infancy, the
    burglary, the brother’s return from sea, and many other passages—and
    thinking that they might be related in a more attractive manner, he
    accepted a proposal from the publisher to edit the book, and _has_
    edited it to the best of his ability, altering its form throughout,
    and making such other alterations as he conceived would improve the
    narration of the facts, without any departure from the facts
    themselves.”

He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death. Above all the
noise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying out--I
heard my mother crying out--and Peggotty. Then he was gone; and the door
was locked outside; and I was lying, fevered, and hot, and torn, and
raging in my puny way, upon the floor.

But don't let the thing spoil your holiday. If we try to do our duty by
people we employ, by exacting their proper service from them on the one
hand, and treating them with all possible consistency, gentleness, and
consideration on the other, we know that we do right. Their doing wrong
cannot change our doing right, and that should be enough for us.

‘Well?’ said Martin.

Meanwhile the mother watched her child in the room above.

Their young friend Bailey sympathized in these feelings to the
fullest extent, and, abating nothing of his patronage, gave them every
encouragement in his power; favouring them, when the general attention
was diverted from his proceedings, with many nods and winks and other
tokens of recognition, and occasionally touching his nose with a
corkscrew, as if to express the Bacchanalian character of the meeting.
In truth, perhaps even the spirits of the two Miss Pecksniffs, and the
hungry watchfulness of Mrs Todgers, were less worthy of note than the
proceedings of this remarkable boy, whom nothing disconcerted or put out
of his way. If any piece of crockery, a dish or otherwise, chanced to
slip through his hands (which happened once or twice), he let it go with
perfect good breeding, and never added to the painful emotions of the
company by exhibiting the least regret. Nor did he, by hurrying to and
fro, disturb the repose of the assembly, as many well-trained servants
do; on the contrary, feeling the hopelessness of waiting upon so large a
party, he left the gentlemen to help themselves to what they wanted, and
seldom stirred from behind Mr Jinkins’s chair, where, with his hands
in his pockets, and his legs planted pretty wide apart, he led the
laughter, and enjoyed the conversation.

This was the time for bringing the poker to bear on the billet of wood.  I
tapped it three times, like an enchanted talisman, and a brilliant host
of merry-makers burst out of it, and sported off by the chimney,--rushing
up the middle in a fiery country dance, and never coming down again.
Meanwhile, by their sparkling light, which threw our lamp into the shade,
I filled the glasses, and gave my Travellers, CHRISTMAS!--CHRISTMAS-EVE,
my friends, when the shepherds, who were Poor Travellers, too, in their
way, heard the Angels sing, "On earth, peace.  Good-will towards men!"

‘Who’s he, Little Mother?’ said Maggy. She had joined her at the window
and was leaning on her shoulder. ‘I see him come in and out often.’

‘Mr Clennam’s mother?’ asked the young man.

"At this very moment, the gentleman in sky-blue turning round, and
seeing the young lady with her face uncovered, vented an exclamation of
rage and jealousy, and, turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom,
pointed a thrust at her heart, which caused my uncle to utter a cry
of apprehension that made the building ring. The lady stepped lightly
aside, and snatching the young man's sword from his hand, before he had
recovered his balance, drove him to the wall, and running it through
him, and the panelling, up to the very hilt, pinned him there, hard
and fast. It was a splendid example. My uncle, with a loud shout of
triumph, and a strength that was irresistible, made his adversary
retreat in the same direction, and plunging the old rapier into the
very centre of a large red flower in the pattern of his waistcoat,
nailed him beside his friend; there they both stood, gentlemen, jerking
their arms and legs about, in agony, like the toy-shop figures that are
moved by a piece of packthread. My uncle always said, afterwards, that
this was one of the surest means he knew of, for disposing of an enemy;
but it was liable to one objection on the ground of expense, inasmuch
as it involved the loss of a sword for every man disabled.

Not having the happiness to know Griggins, we became extremely desirous
to see so pleasant a fellow, the more especially as a stout gentleman
with a powdered head, who was sitting with his breeches buckles almost
touching the hob, whispered us he was a wit of the first water, when
the door opened, and Mr. Griggins being announced, presented himself,
amidst another shout of laughter and a loud clapping of hands from the
younger branches. This welcome he acknowledged by sundry contortions of
countenance, imitative of the clown in one of the new pantomimes, which
were so extremely successful, that one stout gentleman rolled upon an
ottoman in a paroxysm of delight, protesting, with many gasps, that if
somebody didn’t make that fellow Griggins leave off, he would be the
death of him, he knew. At this the company only laughed more
boisterously than before, and as we always like to accommodate our tone
and spirit if possible to the humour of any society in which we find
ourself, we laughed with the rest, and exclaimed, ‘Oh! capital,
capital!’ as loud as any of them.

‘Well!’ said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking
reflectively at the fire; ‘I’m sure we have all on us a great deal
to be grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!’

‘You OUGHT to know, certainly,’ thought Nicholas; ‘but whether you do or
not, is another question.’

“Then, to be told that you discontinued your study with me, was to be
politely told that you abandoned it altogether?” he suggested.

"Still--might she not have been happier with Sam? Be honest, now, and
say just what you think."

He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl’s retreating
figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he
considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the
better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or
thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind
her, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk
with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative
distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.

‘Your loss is great, and your misfortune a heavy one,’ said Mr Haredale,
looking restlessly towards the door: ‘and this is not a time to comfort
you. If it were, I am in no condition to do so. Before I leave you, tell
me one thing, and try to tell me plainly, I implore you. Have you seen,
or heard of Emma?’

The mercer gave him a stealthy glance, which the old man’s keen look
immediately detected. Neither could repress a smile; these good souls
understood one another perfectly, and Ramin saw that this was not the
Excellent Opportunity he desired, and departed.

While he was welcoming them, and passing some high-flown compliments on
the fair Thomasine’s charms, Mr. Jukes was shown into the room; but as
he was in his butler’s dress, his nephew did not condescend to speak to
him.

'You hear what the learned counsel says, Sir,' observed the Judge,
    turning to the miserable and agonized Mr. Winkle.  'Describe the
    occasion to which you refer.'

“Number two, you mean,” said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with
the quality of selfishness.

‘Yes, it were, Sir,’ replied Mrs. Cluppins.

Mrs. Tetterby had him into the parlour by the collar, in that same flash
of time, and repaid him the assault with usury thereto.

‘I think you will,’ said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the
refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. ‘Just a leetle
drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.’

"I mean a bird, sir."

“That is a good fortune,” said I. “But why is it to be mine?”

It was indeed a glad hearing to him, he replied.

‘I should like it very much. We would all be gentlefolks together, then.
Me, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn’t mind then, when
there comes stormy weather.---Not for our own sakes, I mean. We would
for the poor fishermen’s, to be sure, and we’d help ‘em with money when
they come to any hurt.’ This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and
therefore not at all improbable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the
contemplation of it, and little Em’ly was emboldened to say, shyly,

[Sidenote: Miss Dickens.]

‘You will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this
place, of course, Mr. Copperfield?’ said she, looking over her shoulder
at me with the same expression.

‘In times for ever fled Arthur,’ returned Mrs Finching, ‘pray excuse
me Doyce and Clennam infinitely more correct and though unquestionably
distant still ‘tis distance lends enchantment to the view, at least I
don’t mean that and if I did I suppose it would depend considerably on
the nature of the view, but I’m running on again and you put it all out
of my head.’

But through all the confusion and lowness of spirits in which we had
been, so unexpectedly to me, involved, I plainly discerned that Mr. and
Mrs. Micawber and their family were going away from London, and that a
parting between us was near at hand. It was in my walk home that night,
and in the sleepless hours which followed when I lay in bed, that the
thought first occurred to me--though I don’t know how it came into my
head--which afterwards shaped itself into a settled resolution.

‘Wot does he mean by the soft sex, Sammy?’ inquired Mr. Weller, in a
whisper.

With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an
unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.

There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of
that churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing half so
quiet as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel
up, early in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my
mother's room, to look out at it; and I see the red light shining on
the sun-dial, and think within myself, "Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder,
that it can tell the time again?"

‘Both, eh? Why, to say the truth, both have taken a little out of me
to-day, my dear, but that was to be expected. There’s no royal road to
learning; and what is life but learning!’

“Perhaps,” said Carker, with an unusual and indefinable taunt in his
air, “you mistook my position, when you honoured me with the
negotiations in which I have been engaged here”—with a motion of his
hand towards Mrs Dombey.

The plain, frank kindness of the honest schoolmaster, the affectionate
earnestness of his speech and manner, the truth which was stamped upon
his every word and look, gave the child a confidence in him, which the
utmost arts of treachery and dissimulation could never have awakened in
her breast.  She told him all--that they had no friend or
relative--that she had fled with the old man, to save him from a
madhouse and all the miseries he dreaded--that she was flying now, to
save him from himself--and that she sought an asylum in some remote
and primitive place, where the temptation before which he fell would
never enter, and her late sorrows and distresses could have no place.

“Never; oh, God knows, never! My family have never asked a penny of a
parish. They would die first, and so would I, sir; but they said I might
do it, and I had better go to my husband’s parish at once--and they
offered me money to go.”

‘About what, in the devil’s name?’ said Ralph. ‘You spy and speculate on
people’s business with me, do you?’

"Yes, it were, sir."

“If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?”

"Up Newgate Street."

‘I admire your taste, sir,’ says Mr. Chestle. ‘It does you credit. I
suppose you don’t take much interest in hops; but I am a pretty
large grower myself; and if you ever like to come over to our
neighbourhood--neighbourhood of Ashford--and take a run about our
place,--we shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like.’

“That is a bad business,” said Nubis, who already felt his own drops
exercising that absorbent power for which water is so famous, and
incorporating in their substance matters that the Rain-Cloud never
knew.

‘Oh, Master, Master,’ returned Betty Higden, ‘I’ve fought against the
Parish and fled from it, all my life, and I want to die free of it!’

Of course, a sufficient force was immediately sent to the alder clump;
but there was nothing there but some charred sticks, and some clean pork
bones, this time, instead of feathers of fowls, and a cabbage leaf or
two. The boy had had his whipping at noon, after a conference with his
little brother at the keyhole, which had caused him to withdraw the
bolt, and offer no resistance. Considering his cries and groans, he had
run off with surprising agility, and was now, no doubt, far away.

‘I’m bletht if I know what to call it,’ repeated Sleary, shaking his
head, ‘but I have had dogth find me, Thquire, in a way that made me think
whether that dog hadn’t gone to another dog, and thed, “You don’t happen
to know a perthon of the name of Thleary, do you?  Perthon of the name of
Thleary, in the Horthe-Riding way—thtout man—game eye?”  And whether that
dog mightn’t have thed, “Well, I can’t thay I know him mythelf, but I
know a dog that I think would be likely to be acquainted with him.”  And
whether that dog mightn’t have thought it over, and thed, “Thleary,
Thleary!  O yeth, to be thure!  A friend of mine menthioned him to me at
one time.  I can get you hith addreth directly.”  In conthequenth of my
being afore the public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there mutht
be a number of dogth acquainted with me, Thquire, that _I_ don’t know!’

Oh!  He did remember it!  The rain that fell upon the roof, the wind
that mourned outside the door, had foreknowledge in their melancholy
sound.  He knew now what he had done.  He knew now that he had called
down that upon his head, which bowed it lower than the heaviest stroke
of fortune.  He knew now what it was to be rejected and deserted; now,
when every loving blossom he had withered in his innocent daughter's
heart was snowing down in ashes on him.

"Recall the time when you started for Switzerland with Mr. Vendale,"
Bintrey begin.  "You had not left England four-and-twenty hours before
your niece committed an act of imprudence which not even your penetration
could foresee.  She followed her promised husband on his journey, without
asking anybody's advice or permission, and without any better companion
to protect her than a Cellarman in Mr. Vendale's employment."

“I think I see him now,” cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.

‘It goes against me,’ Rachael answered, in a gentler manner, ‘to mistrust
any one; but when I am so mistrusted—when we all are—I cannot keep such
things quite out of my mind.  I ask your pardon for having done you an
injury.  I don’t think what I said now.  Yet I might come to think it
again, wi’ the poor lad so wronged.’

Analytical Chemist again bends and whispers.

‘Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,’ returned Bounderby, ‘and that’s the man.’

‘They took this way?’ demanded Harry: ‘are you sure?’

Of course her relations towards that young gentleman had been already
imparted in Minor Canon Corner.

Joe made no effort to reply. It was the crowning circumstance of his
degradation. He extricated himself from his father’s grasp, darted an
angry look at the departing guest, and returned into the house.

The Doctor was sitting in his easy-chair by the fireside, and his young
wife was on a stool at his feet. The Doctor, with a complacent smile,
was reading aloud some manuscript explanation or statement of a theory
out of that interminable Dictionary, and she was looking up at him. But
with such a face as I never saw. It was so beautiful in its form, it was
so ashy pale, it was so fixed in its abstraction, it was so full of a
wild, sleep-walking, dreamy horror of I don’t know what. The eyes
were wide open, and her brown hair fell in two rich clusters on her
shoulders, and on her white dress, disordered by the want of the lost
ribbon. Distinctly as I recollect her look, I cannot say of what it was
expressive, I cannot even say of what it is expressive to me now, rising
again before my older judgement. Penitence, humiliation, shame, pride,
love, and trustfulness--I see them all; and in them all, I see that
horror of I don’t know what.

‘Mr. Lillyvick,’ said Kenwigs, ‘I hope, for the sake of your niece, that
you won’t object to be reconciled.’

"What are you doing there?" asked Mr. Mell.

If they have ever a fanciful and idle air, perhaps the reader will
suppose them written in the shade of a Sunny Day, in the midst of the
objects of which they treat, and will like them none the worse for having
such influences of the country upon them.

"A disgraceful imposition," observed the old lady.

Sir Leicester leans back in his chair, and breathlessly ejaculates,
“Good heaven!”

That Mr Quilp was himself perplexed, and that in no small degree, by
the contents of the letter, was sufficiently obvious. Before he had got
through the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very
wide and to frown most horribly, the next two or three caused him to
scratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner, and when he came to
the conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and
dismay. After folding and laying it down beside him, he bit the nails
of all of his ten fingers with extreme voracity; and taking it up
sharply, read it again. The second perusal was to all appearance as
unsatisfactory as the first, and plunged him into a profound reverie
from which he awakened to another assault upon his nails and a long
stare at the child, who with her eyes turned towards the ground awaited
his further pleasure.

‘I have the satisfaction to know you are, sir,’ said Mr. Snawley. ‘I
asked one of your references, and he said you were pious.’

“Mischief,” said the daughter.

And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly
indeed, and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance
occurred. Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in
my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as
belonging to a part of my life that was gone—gone like my infancy or
my childhood. I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that
subject, but have written them as faithfully as my memory has
recalled them. And I hope to do, and mean to do, the same down to the
last words of these pages, which I see now not so very far before me.

“You say, yourself, you are not leading a very settled life.”

She set the light upon a bracket in the hall, and laid her hand upon her
heart; upon her eyes; upon her burning head. Then she came on towards
the door with such a wild and hurried step that Mr Bailey lost his
self-possession, and still had his eye where the keyhole had been, when
she opened it.

FRANK. But I have! I'm sorry for him! I couldn't be angry with him if I
tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself! He loves a good
dinner--pleasant moments, and pleasanter companions than he can find in
his own thoughts, or in his mouldy chambers. He may rail at Christmas
till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it, I defy him! If he
finds me going there, year after year and saying, Uncle Scrooge, how are
you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty
pounds, that's something, and I think I shook him yesterday! (_All
laugh._) Well, he has given us plenty of merriment so here's his health.
Uncle Scrooge!

The old sexton soon got better, and was about again.  From him the
child learnt many other things, though of a different kind.  He was not
able to work, but one day there was a grave to be made, and he came to
overlook the man who dug it.  He was in a talkative mood; and the
child, at first standing by his side, and afterwards sitting on the
grass at his feet, with her thoughtful face raised towards his, began
to converse with him.

Every boy was there, but every boy was afraid to speak; so Squeers
glared along the lines to assure himself; and every eye drooped, and
every head cowered down, as he did so.

The bard made no reply, but leaned over his harp again, and spanned its
golden strings. He sang of the chase. The game was a beauteous hind;
eager was the hunter, but too swift was her light foot for his wish.
She distanced him like the wind, which at one moment brushes the cheek,
and the next will be leagues away; and now she was safe, pressing the
mossy sward in the region of the mountain and the lake, where the waters
mingle and spread one silvery sheet for the fair tall heavens to look
into.

I was particularly pleased to see the Irishmen, who formed a distinct
society among themselves, and mustered very strong with their green
scarves; carrying their national Harp and their Portrait of Father
Mathew, high above the people’s heads.  They looked as jolly and
good-humoured as ever; and, working (here) the hardest for their living
and doing any kind of sturdy labour that came in their way, were the most
independent fellows there, I thought.

‘You needn’t, if you don’t like, ma’am,’ was his answer. ‘It’s not of
the least consequence.’

Next to the Spotted Boy, the performer whom Richardson most boasted of
having belonged to his company was Edmund Kean. He, with Mrs. Carey,
_quasi_ mamma, and Henry, _quasi_ brother, were engaged by our spirited
manager; and Kean, over his cups, used to brag of having, by tumbling in
front of the booth, tumbled hundreds of bumpkins in to the spectacles
within. He did Tom Thumb as tiny Booth does now at the St. James's
Theatre; and at a later period, viz. 1806, is stated to have played
Norval, and Motley in the Castle Spectre, for him at Battersea fair.
Another story adds, that he was called on to recite his Tom-Thumbery
before George the Third at Windsor; but we will not vouch for the truth
of the newspaper anecdote.

"Sitting in the open air, John?"

CHAPTER XL -- A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST
CHAMBER

But, assuming the gentleman's title to be considered as an "author" as
established, there is no question that it comes within the scope of the
Literary Fund. They would habitually "lend" money if they did what I
consider to be their duty; as it is they only give money, but they give
it in such instances.

Quilp was plainly staggered by this intelligence, over which he brooded
for some time in moody silence, often raising his eyes to Mr
Swiveller’s face, and sharply scanning its expression.  As he could
read in it, however, no additional information or anything to lead him
to believe he had spoken falsely; and as Mr Swiveller, left to his own
meditations, sighed deeply, and was evidently growing maudlin on the
subject of Mrs Cheggs; the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took
his departure, leaving the bereaved one to his melancholy ruminations.

‘Any such!’ rejoined the mistress; ‘a-dozen-such. An’t there, Tom?’

‘I ha’ coom,’ Stephen began, raising his eyes from the floor, after a
moment’s consideration, ‘to ask yo yor advice.  I need ’t overmuch.  I
were married on Eas’r Monday nineteen year sin, long and dree.  She were
a young lass—pretty enow—wi’ good accounts of herseln.  Well!  She went
bad—soon.  Not along of me.  Gonnows I were not a unkind husband to her.’

Here she whispered him again.

‘Are you going?’ demanded Mrs. Bumble.

‘Went to and fro, and high and low,’ said Mrs Tickit, ‘and saw no sign
of her!’

‘So awful,’ I returned, ‘at night.  The Seine at Paris is very gloomy
too, at such a time, and is probably the scene of far more crime and
greater wickedness; but this river looks so broad and vast, so murky and
silent, seems such an image of death in the midst of the great city’s
life, that—’

“We were right, I needn’t tell the present hearers. Hi! To be sure,
how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the
cause was on! How my noble and learned brother, and all the rest of
’em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they
hadn’t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they
had—Oh, dear me!—nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of
it by any chance!”

“Don’t mind me, my dear,” said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. “Ha!
ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very
lucky it was only me.”

A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking
round, he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider
their verdict. As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see
the people rising above each other to see his face: some hastily
applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their
neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence. A few there were,
who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in
impatient wonder how they could delay. But in no one face--not even
among the women, of whom there were many there--could he read
the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of
all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned.

‘They lived and died very miserably. Did they not, sir?’

‘If I fall,’ said Mr. Winkle, ‘or if the doctor falls, you, my dear
friend, will be tried as an accessory before the fact. Shall I involve
my friend in transportation--possibly for life!’

“Second: convenience, and even elegance.”

‘I understand what you mean by that, but you are not justified in it. I
don’t want, as I raise myself to shake you off, Liz. I want to carry you
up with me. That’s what I want to do, and mean to do. I know what I owe
you. I said to Mr Headstone this very evening, “After all, my sister got
me here.” Well, then. Don’t pull me back, and hold me down. That’s all I
ask, and surely that’s not unconscionable.’

I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME.

There is no time or weather, in England at least, in which a man
walking does not feel this cousinship with everything round. There
are weathers that are intolerable if you are doing anything else but
walking: if you are crouching still against a storm or if you are
driving against it; or if you are riding in extreme cold; or if you are
running too quickly in extreme heat; but it is not so with walking.
You may walk by night or by day, in summer or in winter, in fair
weather or in foul, in calm or in a gale, and in every case you are
doing something native to yourself and going the best way you could go.
All men have felt this.

A modest ring at the bell at length allayed her fears, and Miss Benton,
hurrying into her own room and shutting herself up, in order that she
might preserve that appearance of being taken by surprise which is so
essential to the polite reception of visitors, awaited their coming with
a smiling countenance.

Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.

Not exactly keepin up with his meanin, I shook my head, put on a deep
look, and said, “You’re right there, Mr. Chops.”

“No, my Lady! Oh, no!” Rosa looks up for the first time, quite
frightened at the thought.

"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and
content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly
fortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made,
you were another man."

[Illustration]

‘To be sure, to be sure,’ said the mayor, encouragingly, ‘you could not
have managed it better. Well, sir; it will be necessary for you to
leave here to-night in a post-chaise and four. And the harder the boys
drive, the better. You are not safe from pursuit.’

‘Then you shall hear before I sleep--and in six words, for I want
sleep--how I appear before you, I, Lagnier. Remember that. Not the
other.’

'Sir,' said Mrs. Bardell.

‘Hush, hush!’ said one of the women, stooping over her. ‘Lie down,
lie down!’

--"On the fman's deck, where a man should be,
    With his sword in his hand, and his f at his knee.
    Cockswain, or boatswain, or reefer may try,
    But the first man on board will be Hamilton Tighe!"

‘Oh! but the master wins,’ returned the jailer, with a passing look of
no particular liking at the other man, ‘and you lose. It’s quite another
thing. You get husky bread and sour drink by it; and he gets sausage of
Lyons, veal in savoury jelly, white bread, strachino cheese, and good
wine by it. Look at the birds, my pretty!’

The great drawing-room, which I have already mentioned, and the other
chambers on the ground-floor, were crowded to excess.  The company was
not, in our sense of the term, select, for it comprehended persons of
very many grades and classes; nor was there any great display of costly
attire: indeed, some of the costumes may have been, for aught I know,
grotesque enough.  But the decorum and propriety of behaviour which
prevailed, were unbroken by any rude or disagreeable incident; and every
man, even among the miscellaneous crowd in the hall who were admitted
without any orders or tickets to look on, appeared to feel that he was a
part of the Institution, and was responsible for its preserving a
becoming character, and appearing to the best advantage.

‘Oh no,’ replied Mrs. Kenwigs, ‘but if she grew up what she is now,--only
think of the young dukes and marquises.’

‘_A quarter past one_.

"I couldn't have believed it, sir!" said Mrs. Mann, holding up her
hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. "I never see such a hardened
little wretch!"

"Them as she made, arter she was took ill," replied the old gentleman.

STAVE FIVE.

I FALL INTO CAPTIVITY.

Mrs Gamp took two or three backward steps towards the door, and stopped
there.

‘Oh, I’m in no hurry,’ said Miss Squeers, very sharply.

“Steady, steady!” said the Captain to Diogenes, “what’s amiss with you?
You don’t seem easy in your mind tonight, my boy!”

I did not read from Australia till the end, because I was obliged to be
hard at work that day, and thought it best that the MS. should come back
to you rather than that I should detain it. Of course, I _can_ read it,
whenever it suits you. As to Isabel's dying and Fenwick's growing old, I
would say that, beyond question, whatever the meaning of the story tends
to, is the proper end.

‘Just so,’ returned Mrs. Micawber, ‘It is precisely that. And the fact
is, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that we can not live without something
widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up. Now
I am convinced, myself, and this I have pointed out to Mr. Micawber
several times of late, that things cannot be expected to turn up of
themselves. We must, in a measure, assist to turn them up. I may be
wrong, but I have formed that opinion.’

‘Oh!  Habitual drunkards,’ said Pangloss.

Mr. Bucket makes three distinctly different bows to these three
people. A bow of homage to Sir Leicester, a bow of gallantry to
Volumnia, and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin, to whom
it airily says, “You are a swell about town, and you know me, and I
know you.” Having distributed these little specimens of his tact, Mr.
Bucket rubs his hands.

"So she had," cried Scrooge. "You're right. I'll not gainsay it,
Spirit. God forbid!"

‘Indeed she is!’ said Mrs Todgers. ‘I believe it, sir.’

Sorrow, that I wearied
Should remain so long,
Wreathed my starry glory,
The bright Crown of Song.

Mr. Squeers would, very likely, have carried on the farce of being
offended a little longer, if Mrs. Sliderskew, in her anxiety to restore
herself to her former high position in his good graces, had not become
so extremely affectionate that he stood at some risk of being smothered
by her caresses. Repressing, with as good a grace as possible, these
little familiarities--for which, there is reason to believe, the black
bottle was at least as much to blame as any constitutional infirmity on
the part of Mrs. Sliderskew--he protested that he had only been joking:
and, in proof of his unimpaired good-humour, that he was ready to
examine the deeds at once, if, by so doing, he could afford any
satisfaction or relief of mind to his fair friend.

Mrs. Nickleby was too much flurried by these uncommonly kind salutations,
and her regrets at not having on her other bonnet, to make any immediate
reply, so she merely continued to bend and smile, and betray great
agitation.

"'Your soul burns with revenge. You wish me dead. It is my desire also
to die. There is a strong probability that I shall not undergo the last
punishment of the law. If you would render my death certain, and feed
your revenge, send me, in a small phial, an ounce of prussic acid:
and the bearer of your welcome gift shall carry back the fact that
M'Flummery the swindler, highwayman, and forger,--M'Flummery, who has
cheated all through life, has terminated his career by cheating the law!'

This worthy citizen had risen to his great eminence from small
beginnings.  He had once been a very lean, weazen little boy, never
dreaming of carrying such a weight of flesh upon his bones or of money in
his pockets, and glad enough to take his dinner at a baker’s door, and
his tea at a pump.  But he had long ago forgotten all this, as it was
proper that a wholesale fruiterer, alderman, common-councilman, member of
the worshipful Company of Patten-makers, past sheriff, and, above all, a
Lord Mayor that was to be, should; and he never forgot it more completely
in all his life than on the eighth of November in the year of his
election to the great golden civic chair, which was the day before his
grand dinner at Guildhall.

‘The very thing!’ said the Jew. ‘Bet will go; won’t you, my dear?’

"I thought you came from Oxford?" I returned.

‘The Princess was such a wonderful Princess that she had the power of
knowing secrets, and she said to the tiny woman, Why do you keep it
there? This showed her directly that the Princess knew why she lived
all alone by herself spinning at her wheel, and she kneeled down at
the Princess’s feet, and asked her never to betray her. So the Princess
said, I never will betray you. Let me see it. So the tiny woman closed
the shutter of the cottage window and fastened the door, and trembling
from head to foot for fear that any one should suspect her, opened a
very secret place and showed the Princess a shadow.’

How he labored under an apprehension not uncommon to persons in his
degree, to whom the use of pen and ink is an event, that he couldn't
append his name to a document, not of his own writing, without
committing himself in some shadowy manner, or somehow signing away
vague and enormous sums of money; and how he approached the deeds under
protest, and by dint of the Doctor's coercion, and insisted on pausing
to look at them before writing (the cramped hand, to say nothing of the
phraseology, being so much Chinese to him), and also on turning them
round to see whether there was anything fraudulent, underneath; and how,
having signed his name, he became desolate as one who had parted with
his property and rights; I want the time to tell. Also, how the blue bag
containing his signature, afterwards had a mysterious interest for him,
and he couldn't leave it; also, how Clemency Newcome, in an ecstasy of
laughter at the idea of her own importance and dignity, brooded over the
whole table with her two elbows like a spread eagle, and reposed her
head upon her left arm as a preliminary to the formation of certain
cabalistic characters, which required a deal of ink, and imaginary
counterparts whereof she executed at the same time with her tongue.
Also how, having once tasted ink, she became thirsty in that regard, as
tigers are said to be after tasting another sort of fluid, and wanted to
sign everything, and put her name in all kinds of places. In brief, the
Doctor was discharged of his trust and all its responsibilities; and
Alfred, taking it on himself, was fairly started on the journey of life.

‘For Heaven’s sake, where am I to sit?’ inquired the miserable man of
an old gentleman, into whose stomach he had just fallen for the fourth
time.

The Earl of Derby, who was at that time in the constant habit of
frequenting the green-room, happened to walk in at the moment, and
seeing a lonesome-looking little boy dressed and painted after a manner
very inconsistent with his solitary air, good-naturedly called him
towards him.

One of the first consequences of this peace was, that the King went
over to Normandy with his son Prince William and a great retinue, to
have the Prince acknowledged as his successor by the Norman Nobles, and
to contract the promised marriage (this was one of the many promises
the King had broken) between him and the daughter of the Count of
Anjou. Both these things were triumphantly done, with great show and
rejoicing; and on the twenty-fifth of November, in the year one
thousand one hundred and twenty, the whole retinue prepared to embark
at the Port of Barfleur, for the voyage home.

"Ah!" said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes.
"It is gone, you see."

Mr. Mayor, Lord Dufferin in his speech so affecting to me, so eloquently
uttered, and so rapturously received, made a graceful and gracious
allusion to the immediate occasion of my present visit to your noble
city.  It is no homage to Liverpool, based upon a moment’s untrustworthy
enthusiasm, but it is the solid fact built upon the rock of experience
that when I first made up my mind, after considerable deliberation,
systematically to meet my readers in large numbers, face to face, and to
try to express myself to them through the breath of life, Liverpool stood
foremost among the great places out of London to which I looked with
eager confidence and pleasure.  And why was this?  Not merely because of
the reputation of its citizens for generous estimation of the arts; not
merely because I had unworthily filled the chair of its great
self-educational institution long ago; not merely because the place had
been a home to me since the well-remembered day when its blessed roofs
and steeples dipped into the Mersey behind me on the occasion of my first
sailing away to see my generous friends across the Atlantic twenty-seven
years ago.  Not for one of those considerations, but because it had been
my happiness to have a public opportunity of testing the spirit of its
people.  I had asked Liverpool for help towards the worthy preservation
of Shakespeare’s house.  On another occasion I had ventured to address
Liverpool in the names of Leigh Hunt and Sheridan Knowles.  On still
another occasion I had addressed it in the cause of the brotherhood and
sisterhood of letters and the kindred arts, and on each and all the
response had been unsurpassably spontaneous, open-handed, and munificent.

BOATSWAIN'S MATE--_Aboard Ship_]

I did so and found it correct.

As they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was a warm day,
she seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied she was jealous
even of the saucepan on it; and I have reason to know that she took its
impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in
dudgeon; for I saw her, with my own discomfited eyes, shake her fist at
me once, when those culinary operations were going on, and no one else
was looking. The sun streamed in at the little window, but she sat with
her own back and the back of the large chair towards it, screening the
fire as if she were sedulously keeping IT warm, instead of it keeping
her warm, and watching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion
of the preparations for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her
such extreme joy that she laughed aloud--and a very unmelodious laugh
she had, I must say.

_Fitz-Growl._--Ah! he's an old friend of mine. He plays the devil in all
my pieces.

[Later in the evening, Mr. Dickens rose and said:—]

“Have it your own way,” rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. “For no
good, then.”

Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing
her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but
only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. “Tell
the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”

“Restless without the little girl,” the Doctor whispered Mr Dombey. “We
found it best to have her in again.”

"Oh, Floy!" cried her brother, "how I love you!  How I love you, Floy!"

He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house,
which perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have
compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought,
to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned
up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps
towards it.

‘It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air,’ returned Eugene. ‘He has
undeniable intentions that way.’

Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver.
He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and
desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The
boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no
recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and
well-remembered face sunk heavily into his heart. But his heart _was_
heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow
bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be laid in a calm
and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving
gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him
in his sleep.

CHAPTER XXII.
The Sea Still Rises

The bridegroom, who had been staying at the house for two or three
days previous, sallied forth gallantly to Dulwich Church to meet
the bride, attended by Mr. Pickwick, Ben Allen, Bob Sawyer, and Mr.
Tupman; with Sam Weller outside, having at his button-hole a white
favour, the gift of his lady-love, and clad in a new and gorgeous suit
of livery invented for the occasion. They were met by the Wardles,
and the Winkles, and the bride and bridesmaids, and the Trundles; and
the ceremony having been performed, the coaches rattled back to Mr.
Pickwick's to breakfast, where little Mr. Perker already awaited them.

‘You see,’ pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption,
‘we are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that
it must be so. For instance, it’s your object to take care of number
one--meaning yourself.’

“And it may seem remarkable in one who is a mother also,” resumed Mrs
Blimber.

[In acknowledging the vote of thanks, Mr. Dickens said:—]

‘Officer!’ said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with
the newspaper. ‘Who is this fellow?’

The face that had humbled itself before her, looked on her now with
such invincible hatred and defiance; and the hand that had gently
touched her arm, was clenched with such a show of evil purpose, as if
it would gladly strangle her; that she drew close to her brother for
protection.

We were taking an early dinner at this house, on the day after our
arrival, which was Sunday, when a steamboat came in sight, and presently
touched at the wharf.  As she proved to be on her way to Buffalo, we
hurried on board with all speed, and soon left Sandusky far behind us.

‘No doubt you did,’ returned the gentleman. ‘But, Mr Pecksniff, the
whole thing resolves itself into an instance of the peculiarities
of genius. Every man of true genius has his peculiarity. Sir, the
peculiarity of my friend Slyme is, that he is always waiting round the
corner. He is perpetually round the corner, sir. He is round the corner
at this instant. Now,’ said the gentleman, shaking his forefinger before
his nose, and planting his legs wider apart as he looked attentively in
Mr Pecksniff’s face, ‘that is a remarkably curious and interesting trait
in Mr Slyme’s character; and whenever Slyme’s life comes to be written,
that trait must be thoroughly worked out by his biographer or society
will not be satisfied. Observe me, society will not be satisfied!’

‘Mr Chuzzlewit,’ interrupted Pecksniff, shedding tears. ‘I am not angry,
sir. I cannot be angry with you. But did you never, my dear sir,
express a desire that the unnatural young man who by his wicked arts has
estranged your good opinion from me, for the time being; only for the
time being; that your grandson, Mr Chuzzlewit, should be dismissed my
house? Recollect yourself, my Christian friend.’

It was Monks.

‘Oh-h!’

‘No!’ said I, looking from face to face.

‘Widders, Sammy,’ replied Mr. Weller, slightly changing colour. ‘Widders
are ‘ceptions to ev’ry rule. I have heerd how many ordinary women one
widder’s equal to in pint o’ comin’ over you. I think it’s five-and-
twenty, but I don’t rightly know vether it ain’t more.’

‘What’s that?’ asked the father; grinning already in anticipation.

‘I’ll tell you what I am,’ whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it go at last,
with a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes. ‘I’m a
Tartar.’

‘Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without
coming to see me.’

Then good-bye and good-bye, and charming occasion worthy of the Golden
Age, and more about the flitch of bacon, and the like of that; and
Twemlow goes staggering across Piccadilly with his hand to his forehead,
and is nearly run down by a flushed lettercart, and at last drops
safe in his easy-chair, innocent good gentleman, with his hand to his
forehead still, and his head in a whirl.

DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _January 3rd, 1850._

There ain’t a bell, is there, ma’am?’ said the short chairman.

Walter has turned up, rather brilliant on the whole; and that (with
shoals of remembrances and messages which I don't deliver) is all my
present intelligence.

"Snodgrass! Since last Christmas!" were the first broken words that
issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman.

“It was quite a pleasure to know that one of our founders—or more
correctly speaking,” said the old man, with a great glory in his subject
and his knowledge of it, “one of the learned gentlemen that helped endow
us in Queen Elizabeth’s time, for we were founded afore her day—left in
his will, among the other bequests he made us, so much to buy holly, for
garnishing the walls and windows, come Christmas. There was something
homely and friendly in it. Being but strange here, then, and coming at
Christmas time, we took a liking for his very picter that hangs in what
used to be, anciently, afore our ten poor gentlemen commuted for an
annual stipend in money, our great Dinner Hall.—A sedate gentleman in a
peaked beard, with a ruff round his neck, and a scroll below him, in old
English letters, ‘Lord! keep my memory green!’ You know all about him,
Mr. Redlaw?”

It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my
dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not
get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to
remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account
to open the door.

‘That she will, I’ll be bound,’ replied Miss Knag, squeezing Kate’s arm
in her own, to point the joke.

I AM INVOLVED IN MYSTERY.

‘The town’s as flat, my dear feller,’ replied Mr Chuckster, ‘as the
surface of a Dutch oven.  There’s no news.  By-the-bye, that lodger of
yours is a most extraordinary person.  He quite eludes the most
vigorous comprehension, you know.  Never was such a feller!’

"Get along with you!" said Sarah; "and don't call me a lovely vision,
or I'll scream out of my window into the street. It serves you right!"

M. Beaupré came and engaged himself to teach me French, German, and
all the sciences; but he made me teach him my native language, and
taught me many things that did me little good. He was fond of brandy,
and was, as I was told, too ardent an admirer of ladies. I remember
only that one day, when my respected tutor was lying upon his bed in a
hopeless state of drunkenness, and I was cutting up a map of Moscow for
a kite, my father entered the room, boxed my ears, and turned moussié
out of the house, to the great joy of Savéliitch, and to my sorrow. My
education being thus brought to a sudden close, I amused myself until I
had completed my sixteenth year, in playing at leap-frog, and watching
my mother make her exquisite preparations of honey, when one day my
father said to my mother:

“Oh, Harry, Harry,” said the young lady, bursting into tears, “I wish I
could, and spare myself this pain.”

“You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”

The illustrious visitor then put out his coat-cuff, and for a moment
entombed Mrs Sparkler’s hand: wrist, bracelet, and all. Where his own
hand had shrunk to, was not made manifest, but it was as remote from Mrs
Sparkler’s sense of touch as if he had been a highly meritorious Chelsea
Veteran or Greenwich Pensioner.

"Now, I'm going to give you a word or two of good advice, my girl," said
the Alderman, in his nice easy way. "It's my place to give advice, you
know, because I'm a Justice. You know I'm a Justice, don't you?"

"My memory is not very good in such particulars," said I, to the
elegant young man with whom I was speaking; "pray proceed with your
narration, and never mind your ancestors."

‘Tired!’ echoed Caleb, with a great burst of animation, ‘what should tire
me, Bertha?  _I_ was never tired.  What does it mean?’

"And your mamma," said Peggotty.

About this period, a change came over the spirit of the parish. A very
quiet, respectable, dozing old gentleman, who had officiated in our
chapel-of-ease for twelve years previously, died one fine morning,
without having given any notice whatever of his intention. This
circumstance gave rise to counter-sensation the first; and the arrival
of his successor occasioned counter-sensation the second. He was a
pale, thin, cadaverous man, with large black eyes, and long straggling
black hair: his dress was slovenly in the extreme, his manner ungainly,
his doctrines startling; in short, he was in every respect the
antipodes of the curate. Crowds of our female parishioners flocked to
hear him; at first, because he was _so_ odd-looking, then because his
face was _so_ expressive, then because he preached _so_ well; and at
last, because they really thought that, after all, there was something
about him which it was quite impossible to describe. As to the curate,
he was all very well; but certainly, after all, there was no denying
that—that—in short, the curate wasn’t a novelty, and the other
clergyman was. The inconstancy of public opinion is proverbial: the
congregation migrated one by one. The curate coughed till he was black
in the face—it was in vain. He respired with difficulty—it was equally
ineffectual in awakening sympathy. Seats are once again to be had in
any part of our parish church, and the chapel-of-ease is going to be
enlarged, as it is crowded to suffocation every Sunday!

‘Time--for what?’ said the spinster aunt coquettishly.

His daughter Amy gently tried to calm him, but he would not on any
account be calmed. He said his spirit was up, and wouldn’t endure this.

BOULOGNE, _Wednesday, August 2nd, 1854._

There was a fire in Newman’s garret; and a candle had been left burning;
the floor was cleanly swept, the room was as comfortably arranged as
such a room could be, and meat and drink were placed in order upon the
table. Everything bespoke the affectionate care and attention of Newman
Noggs, but Newman himself was not there.

Then did Pea and I once more embark in our four-oared galley, and glide
swiftly down the river with the tide.  And while the shrewd East rasped
and notched us, as with jagged razors, did my friend Pea impart to me
confidences of interest relating to the Thames Police; we, between
whiles, finding ‘duty boats’ hanging in dark corners under banks, like
weeds—our own was a ‘supervision boat’—and they, as they reported ‘all
right!’ flashing their hidden light on us, and we flashing ours on them.
These duty boats had one sitter in each: an Inspector: and were rowed
‘Ran-dan,’ which—for the information of those who never graduated, as I
was once proud to do, under a fireman-waterman and winner of Kean’s Prize
Wherry: who, in the course of his tuition, took hundreds of gallons of
rum and egg (at my expense) at the various houses of note above and below
bridge; not by any means because he liked it, but to cure a weakness in
his liver, for which the faculty had particularly recommended it—may be
explained as rowed by three men, two pulling an oar each, and one a pair
of sculls.

‘You are surprised,’ said Quilp.  ‘Well, perhaps that’s natural.  You
have no secret from me now, I say; no, not one.  For now, I know, that
all those sums of money, that all those loans, advances, and supplies
that you have had from me, have found their way to--shall I say the
word?’

There was a lovely garden to Mr. Spenlow's house; and though that was
not the best time of the year for seeing a garden, it was so beautifully
kept, that I was quite enchanted. There was a charming lawn, there were
clusters of trees, and there were perspective walks that I could just
distinguish in the dark, arched over with trellis-work, on which shrubs
and flowers grew in the growing season. "Here Miss Spenlow walks by
herself," I thought. "Dear me!"

(Others in preparation)

Nell was taught a little speech about each one of them, and so apt was
she that one rehearsal rendered her able to take the willow wand, which
Mrs. Jarley had formerly wielded, and tell the interesting history of
this very select Waxwork show to the audiences which presently began to
come.

“Well. We were speaking, the other evening, of my black humours.”

If the conventional Cherub could ever grow up and be clothed, he might
be photographed as a portrait of Wilfer. His chubby, smooth, innocent
appearance was a reason for his being always treated with condescension
when he was not put down. A stranger entering his own poor house at
about ten o’clock P.M. might have been surprised to find him sitting up
to supper. So boyish was he in his curves and proportions, that his
old schoolmaster meeting him in Cheapside, might have been unable to
withstand the temptation of caning him on the spot. In short, he was
the conventional cherub, after the supposititious shoot just mentioned,
rather grey, with signs of care on his expression, and in decidedly
insolvent circumstances.

‘In confidence.’

‘Keeps the organ moist, does it, Wegg?’ asked Mr Boffin, with innocent
eagerness.

‘Nonsense,’ rejoined the girl coolly, ‘Go on, Fagin. I know what
he’s going to say, Bill; he needn’t mind me.’

[Illustration: HE SOON CAST HIS EYES UPON A CHAIR, INTO WHICH HE SKIPPED
WITH UNCOMMON AGILITY, AND, PERCHING HIMSELF ON THE BACK WITH HIS FEET
UPON THE SEAT, WAS THUS ENABLED TO LOOK ON--Chap. ix.]

"Why, Mr. Weller," replied Job, "I don't mind telling you my little
secrets, because, you know, we took such a fancy for each other when we
first met. You recollect how pleasant we were that morning?"

The search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent
footsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,
commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.
There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain
that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must
have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could
have accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood skirted the
meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that
covert for the same reason.

‘Not if your wish is gratified,’ replied Nicholas. ‘I am sure I shall
have a good one in that case.’

‘And about time to do it,’ grumbles Silas, ‘when a man’s visitors,
without a word of notice, conduct themselves with the sudden wiciousness
of Jacks-in-boxes! Don’t come flying out of your chair like that, Mr
Venus!’

“Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew, laying
his hand upon it after a short pause.

Some of the boys teased David by pretending he was a dog, calling him
Towser, and patting and stroking him; but, on the whole, it was not so
bad as David had expected. The head boy, Steerforth, promised to take
care of him, and David loved him dearly, and thought him a great hero.
Steerforth took a great fancy to the pretty bright-eyed little fellow,
and David became a favorite with all the boys, by telling them all he
could remember of the tales he had read.

‘Well, really,’ said Traddles, cheerfully, ‘I must, once more, give Mr.
Micawber high praise. But for his having been so patient and persevering
for so long a time, we never could have hoped to do anything worth
speaking of. And I think we ought to consider that Mr. Micawber did
right, for right’s sake, when we reflect what terms he might have made
with Uriah Heep himself, for his silence.’

A grin stole over the fat boy's features as he said:

‘There was such a game with Fogg here, this mornin’,’ said the man in
the brown coat, ‘while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers, and you two
were gone to the stamp-office. Fogg was down here, opening the letters
when that chap as we issued the writ against at Camberwell, you know,
came in--what’s his name again?’

Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain
the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might
be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts
with a trembling hand, and opened the door.

Maitre Voigt laughed softly to himself; closed the portfolio in which the
papers had been sent to him; handed it to Obenreizer.

The person referred to snapped his finger and thumb again.

“Will you be so good as read it over again? I think there’s a mistake.”

"Ah!" said the Jew, turning rather pale. "They--they're mine, Oliver: my
little property. All I have to live upon in my old age. The folks call
me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's all."

‘And the leather hat-box?’

He resumed.  “Now, sir, mark this, and judge how my mind is troubled.
The spectre came back, a week ago.  Ever since, it has been there, now
and again, by fits and starts.”

‘I should think so,’ said the gentleman. ‘There ain’t no sort of orse
that I ain’t bred, and no sort of dorg. Orses and dorgs is some
men’s fancy. They’re wittles and drink to me--lodging, wife, and
children--reading, writing, and Arithmetic--snuff, tobacker, and sleep.’

‘It only remains,’ said Grandmarina in conclusion, ‘to make an end of the
fish-bone.’

“There is something in your manner which would almost imply that she
will hear me coldly, mother,” said the young man, anxiously.

“For the Port of Barbados, Boys!
                    Cheerily!
Leaving old England behind us, Boys!
                    Cheerily!”
Here the Captain roared in chorus—
                    “Oh cheerily, cheerily!
                                        Oh cheer-i-ly!”

The worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella's ear, kissed her without the
smallest scruple, kissed his daughter also with great affection, and
shook Mr. Snodgrass warmly by the hand.

He turned, and found himself face to face with Marguerite's guardian.

Then I would say, "Now let us try together. Let me show you, Dora."

‘How should you?’ repeated Quilp with a sneer.  ‘You’re a nice lawyer,
an’t you?  Ugh, you idiot!’

“Mercy on us!” says she, “haven’t you seen enough of him yet?”

"Why, it's hot," he said.

‘Nothin’ more likely!’ Mrs Gamp replied. ‘As well I have experienged, I
do assure you, sir.’

When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis
relapsed into perfect silence; and I, feeling quite worn out by all that
had happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I
slept soundly until we got to Yarmouth; which was so entirely new
and strange to me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once
abandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty’s
family there, perhaps even with little Em’ly herself.

‘Well!’ said Mr Pinch, after a short silence, his usually subdued tone
being even now more subdued than ever. ‘I can hardly think enough of
what you tell me. Why, what will become of Mrs Lupin, Mark?’

‘True. Pray how did you introduce her at my mother’s!’

MY DEAR MR. RYLAND,

Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what
something desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the
door.

When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,
and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot,
described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and
the table; sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution,
he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a
dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without
the slightest preface.

"You had no sleep last night; and a kind of brain-congestion frequently
comes, at first, of such cold," said Obenreizer.  "I have seen it often.
After all, we shall have our journey for nothing, it seems."

“Well, Ramin,” gaily said the old man, “how are you getting on? Have you
been tormenting the poor widow up stairs? Why, man, we must live and let
live!”

‘By whom?’

“Who lives here?”

The loving couple were thus loving all the way to Twickenham, but when we
arrived there (by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty and
vicious) they were more playful than ever, for Mrs. Leaver threw stones
at Mr. Leaver, and Mr. Leaver ran after Mrs. Leaver on the grass, in a
most innocent and enchanting manner.  At dinner, too, Mr. Leaver _would_
steal Mrs. Leaver’s tongue, and Mrs. Leaver _would_ retaliate upon Mr.
Leaver’s fowl; and when Mrs. Leaver was going to take some lobster salad,
Mr. Leaver wouldn’t let her have any, saying that it made her ill, and
she was always sorry for it afterwards, which afforded Mrs. Leaver an
opportunity of pretending to be cross, and showing many other
prettinesses.  But this was merely the smiling surface of their loves,
not the mighty depths of the stream, down to which the company, to say
the truth, dived rather unexpectedly, from the following accident.  It
chanced that Mr. Leaver took upon himself to propose the bachelors who
had first originated the notion of that entertainment, in doing which, he
affected to regret that he was no longer of their body himself, and
pretended grievously to lament his fallen state.  This Mrs. Leaver’s
feelings could not brook, even in jest, and consequently, exclaiming
aloud, ‘He loves me not, he loves me not!’ she fell in a very pitiable
state into the arms of Mrs. Starling, and, directly becoming insensible,
was conveyed by that lady and her husband into another room.  Presently
Mr. Leaver came running back to know if there was a medical gentleman in
company, and as there was, (in what company is there not?) both Mr.
Leaver and the medical gentleman hurried away together.

"Certainly," replied the unwelcome visitor.

“And what is he to do then?” asked my guardian.

Down in Lincolnshire

"Speak them!" said Niall. "Stay! Whom concern they? The evil thou
wouldst avert hath nearly come to pass. My soul sickens already! To
whom do the tidings relate that demand such preparation? To whom _can_
they relate but to Glorvina?" The head of Niall dropped upon his breast.

‘And how is your father, Young John? How--ha--how are they all, Young
John?’

“Imagine,” exclaimed Mr. Crisparkle, with glistening eyes: “Miss Rosa
Bud and Mr. Grewgious, imagine Mr. Tartar, when he was the smallest of
juniors, diving for me, catching me, a big heavy senior, by the hair of
the head, and striking out for the shore with me like a water-giant!”

"I hope so, my dear," said Mr. Omer. "As I have got my breath now, I
think I'll measure this young scholar. Would you walk into the shop,
Master Copperfield?"

[Illustration: _The evidence destroyed._]

“No,” said Ada, “but it may be better to forget all about it.”

"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!"

‘What news?’ returned Newman.

It was a cross-country road, full, after the first three or four miles,
of holes and cart-ruts, which, being covered by the snow, were so many
pitfalls to the trembling horses, and obliged them to keep a footpace.
As it was next to impossible for men so much agitated as they were by
this time, to sit still and move so slowly, all three got out and
plodded on behind the carriage.  The distance seemed interminable, and
the walk was most laborious.  As each was thinking within himself that
the driver must have lost his way, a church bell, close at hand, struck
the hour of midnight, and the carriage stopped.  It had moved softly
enough, but when it ceased to crunch the snow, the silence was as
startling as if some great noise had been replaced by perfect stillness.

"To be sure," said Mr. Peggotty. "That's her, and so she is. Thankee,
sir."

This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the
burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an
outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel
curs, to join in the pursuit. Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity
of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was
a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was
treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past
thirty.

"Curious circumstance about those initials, sir," said Mr. Magnus.
"You will observe--P.M.--post meridian. In hasty notes to intimate
acquaintance, I sometimes sign myself 'Afternoon.' It amuses my friends
very much, Mr. Pickwick."

“Oh, poor child,” said I; “let me out, if you please!”

“You are not so well today. You look distressed. You have been
weeping.”

Miss Pecksniff dashed in so suddenly, that she was placed in an
embarrassing position. For though she had completed her bridal toilette
as to her head, on which she wore a bridal bonnet with orange flowers,
she had not completed it as to her skirts, which displayed no choicer
decoration than a dimity bedgown. She had dashed in, in fact, about
half-way through, to console her sister, in her affliction, with a sight
of the aforesaid bonnet; and being quite unconscious of the presence of
a visitor, until she found Mr Chuzzlewit standing face to face with her,
her surprise was an uncomfortable one.

‘Will you?’ returned Clemency.  ‘Well! that’s very good of you.’

[Illustration: DANIEL QUILP SAT HIMSELF DOWN IN A WHERRY TO CROSS TO THE
OPPOSITE SHORE--Chap. v.]

My aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, which was a
lesson to all of us--to me, I am sure. She was extremely gracious to
Peggotty, except when I inadvertently called her by that name; and,
strange as I knew she felt in London, appeared quite at home. She was to
have my bed, and I was to lie in the sitting-room, to keep guard over
her. She made a great point of being so near the river, in case of a
conflagration; and I suppose really did find some satisfaction in that
circumstance.

“I hope you will not object to my asking your wife,” said I, “how the
lady looked.”

The events of such a day might have worn out the body and spirit of
a much younger man than he, but he sat in deep and painful meditation
until the morning was bright. Nor did he even then seek any prolonged
repose, but merely slumbered in his chair, until seven o’clock, when Mr
Tapley had appointed to come to him by his desire; and came--as fresh
and clean and cheerful as the morning itself.

“He!” the other man seemed to answer; “could I mistake him, think you?
If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and
he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to
point him out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across
his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn’t a mark above it, that
he lay buried there?”

It happened one day that Peter, (who was, according to the Chronicle of
Lanercost,[2] a proud and worldly man,--as was too often the case with
bishops of that period,) with a bugle dangling at his belt, and mounted
upon a fiery steed, attended by a vast retinue of men, horses, and
hounds, was in hot pursuit of a wary old fox; his courser,--more fleet
than the mountain roe, scarce bruising the grass with his iron-shod
hoofs,--like Bucephalus of Macedon, took fright at his own shadow, and
became unmanageable; nor were all the skill and spur of the rider able
to check his impetuous speed: the harder the bishop pulled, the more
unruly became his steed; the bridle now suddenly snapped in twain,
and the bishop was left to the fate that awaited him. Velocipede,
for so the horse was called, now seemed exultingly to bound over the
deepest ditches, and to clear the highest thorny-twining hedge with the
greatest ease: nothing could moderate his foaming rage; he resembled
more the far-famed Pegasus of Medusan blood, than the palfrey of a
gentle bishop. The retinue, and eager hounds, notwithstanding their
utmost endeavour to keep pace with their master, were left far behind.

‘Pardon me, but I do,’ returned Mrs Wilfer.

CHAPTER 10 -- CONTAINING STRANGE MATTER, ON WHICH MANY EVENTS IN THIS HISTORY MAY, FOR THEIR GOOD OR EVIL INFLUENCE, CHIEFLY DEPEND

He gave way more. The opposite party followed up the attack.

“And so your family has games in the kitchen to-night, my dear, has
they?” inquired Sam of Emma.

‘Alone. Three hours ago.’

‘Why, let me see,’ said Quilp.  ‘It must be a matter of nearly two
years since we were first acquainted.’

"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why
give it as a reason for not coming now?"

“Loredano!” I stammered.  “What Loredano?  There was a Marchese—”

‘Mist Wrayburn. Tried to nudge you, but you wouldn’t. You want that
drection. You want t’know where she lives. _Do_ you Mist Wrayburn?’

‘I will not go in just yet,’ said Lizzie. ‘And you have a distance
before you, and will walk faster without me.’

In the midst of her astonishment as she recognized him in his altered
dress, so much of her old smile came back to her face that Bailey was
glad. But next moment he was sorry again, for he saw tears standing in
her poor dim eyes.

Ever faithfully.

THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF
  THE PICKWICK CLUB

“It is not indeed, my friend,” rejoined Mr. Brownlow; “but my business
with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has
seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as
well—even at the cost of some pain and fear—that he should see him
now.”

‘How can I assist you, child?’ said Ralph, rising from his chair, and
pacing up and down the room in his old attitude.

‘Do you spell it with a “V” or a “W”?’ inquired the judge.

_3rd Wife._

‘Now,’ said Mortimer, ‘what is it?’

Mr. Bumble nodded.

"Cannot you?  Evie, what I have been saying is true of every moral
law worth having, of every ideal of life worth striving after, that
men have yet conceived.  But it is only half the truth of
Christianity.  You know that.  We must strive, for the promise is
to him that overcometh; but though our aim be even higher than is
that of others, we cannot in the end fail to reach it.  The victory
of the Cross is ours.  You know that?  You believe that?"

Annie, thus addressed, made no reply.

‘Probably you don’t mistake, sir,’ was Miss Wren’s cool answer; ‘because
you had it on the best authority. Mine, you know.’

“The panels—are they strong?”

‘I have thought of you, Little Dorrit, every day, every hour, every
minute, since I have been here.’

"What were you going past for, eh?" he added, as he closed the door and
led the way along a passage to a room behind.

It was market-morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep,
with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the
reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which
seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above. All the
pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as
could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied
up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen,
three or four deep. Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys,
thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled
together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs,
the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the
grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts,
oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and
roar of voices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding,
pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and
discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market;
and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly
running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered
it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the
senses.

Naturally as this was said, it was not said so naturally but that a
kindred spirit like old Arthur Gride might have discerned a design upon
the part of Ralph to lead him on to much more explicit statements and
explanations than he would have volunteered, or that Ralph could in all
likelihood have obtained by any other means. Old Arthur, however, was so
intent upon his own designs, that he suffered himself to be overreached,
and had no suspicion but that his good friend was in earnest.

“Charmed! Enchanted!” said Mr. Turveydrop, rising with his
high-shouldered bow. “Permit me!” Handing chairs. “Be seated!”
Kissing the tips of his left fingers. “Overjoyed!” Shutting his eyes
and rolling. “My little retreat is made a paradise.” Recomposing
himself on the sofa like the second gentleman in Europe.

"Come in!" said I. "Who is it? and what do you want?"

‘I knew I should quench her,’ said Sim, rather embarrassed by this
circumstance. ‘Of course I was certain it would come to this, but there
was nothing else to be done--if I hadn’t eyed her over, she wouldn’t
have come down. Here. Keep up a minute, Miggs. What a slippery figure
she is! There’s no holding her, comfortably. Do keep up a minute, Miggs,
will you?’

"There is but one question, my dear ma'am, I could wish to ask," said
Mrs. Micawber. "The climate, I believe, is healthy."

‘In course of time, however, the thing got ground, the experiment was
made, and they lighted up Pall Mall.  Tom’s uncle went to see it.  I’ve
heard that he fell off his ladder fourteen times that night, from
weakness, and that he would certainly have gone on falling till he killed
himself, if his last tumble hadn’t been into a wheelbarrow which was
going his way, and humanely took him home.  “I foresee in this,” says
Tom’s uncle faintly, and taking to his bed as he spoke—“I foresee in
this,” he says, “the breaking up of our profession.  There’s no more
going the rounds to trim by daylight, no more dribbling down of the oil
on the hats and bonnets of ladies and gentlemen when one feels in
spirits.  Any low fellow can light a gas-lamp.  And it’s all up.”  In
this state of mind, he petitioned the government for—I want a word again,
gentlemen—what do you call that which they give to people when it’s found
out, at last, that they’ve never been of any use, and have been paid too
much for doing nothing?’

"These are early days, Trot," she pursued, "and Rome was not built in a
day, nor in a year. You have chosen freely for yourself;" a cloud passed
over her face for a moment, I thought; "and you have chosen a very
pretty and a very affectionate creature. It will be your duty, and it
will be your pleasure too--of course I know that; I am not delivering a
lecture--to estimate her (as you chose her) by the qualities she has,
and not by the qualities she may not have. The latter you must develop
in her, if you can. And if you cannot, child," here my aunt rubbed her
nose, "you must just accustom yourself to do without 'em. But remember,
my dear, your future is between you two. No one can assist you; you are
to work it out for yourselves. This is marriage, Trot; and Heaven bless
you both, in it, for a pair of babes in the wood as you are!"

Mr. Crummles being in a moralising mood, might possibly have moralised
for some minutes longer if he had not mechanically put his hand towards
his waistcoat pocket, where he was accustomed to keep his snuff. The
absence of any pocket at all in the usual direction, suddenly recalled
to his recollection the fact that he had no waistcoat on; and this
leading him to a contemplation of the extreme scantiness of his
attire, he shut the door abruptly, and retired upstairs with great
precipitation.

“I know they will always keep _one_ till it’s found out,” said Monks
contemptuously.

Mr. Jingle’s face gradually relaxed; and something distantly resembling
a wink quivered for an instant in his left eye.

"What do you call wasting of it?" asked old Joe.

"After sunset, at my casement,
Still I place a signal light;
He will see its well-known shining
Should his ship return at night.

‘I think it must have made you rather cross, dear Ma and Lavvy, and I
know I deserved that you should be very cross. But you see I had been
such a heedless, heartless creature, and had led you so to expect that
I should marry for money, and so to make sure that I was incapable of
marrying for love, that I thought you couldn’t believe me. Because, you
see, you didn’t know how much of Good, Good, Good, I had learnt from
John. Well! So I was sly about it, and ashamed of what you supposed me
to be, and fearful that we couldn’t understand one another and might
come to words, which we should all be sorry for afterwards, and so I
said to John that if he liked to take me without any fuss, he might. And
as he did like, I let him. And we were married at Greenwich church in
the presence of nobody—except an unknown individual who dropped in,’
here her eyes sparkled more brightly, ‘and half a pensioner. And now,
isn’t it nice, dearest Ma and Lavvy, to know that no words have been
said which any of us can be sorry for, and that we are all the best of
friends at the pleasantest of teas!’

Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and a
loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not
whether to advance or fly.

The strange gentleman looked at him as if in pity for his ignorance or
prejudice, and said:

The Ghost conducted him through several streets to poor Bob Cratchit's
house; the dwelling he had visited before: and found the mother and the
children seated round the fire.

Received after serving in the Peninsular War.

There is a military criticism which is placed here while summarising
the results of this action. It is given in the _M.S. Journal of a Field
Officer_:--‘There is one point which has never been explained to my
satisfaction. After the defeat at Vinegar Hill the main body of the
rebels retreated to Wexford, where they divided--one column crossed
Wexford bridge, and made their way to the north of the county about
Gorey; now this body must have been due north while General Lake was
moving due south from Vinegar Hill upon Wexford, so that they must have
actually passed each other at a distance of not six miles between the
parallel roads, as a glance at the map will show. Perhaps General Lake
did not consider himself strong enough to divide and occupy both roads
to Wexford, or perhaps he might have thought “the stag at bay’s a
dangerous foe,” and permitted them to weaken themselves by allowing them
to quietly disbandon. It cost, however, much loyal blood at Gorey.’

“A year and more,” said Alice, thoughtfully intent upon her face.
“Months upon months since you brought me here!”

The hardest part of all their wanderings was now before them. They slept
in the open air that night, and on the following morning some men
offered to take them a long distance on their barge on the river. These
men, though they were not unkindly, were very rugged, noisy fellows, and
they drank and quarreled fearfully among themselves, to Nell's
inexpressible terror. It rained, too, heavily, and she was wet and
cold. At last they reached the great city whither the barge was bound,
and here they wandered up and down, being now penniless, and watched the
faces of those who passed, to find among them a ray of encouragement or
hope. Ill in body, and sick to death at heart, the child needed her
utmost courage and will even to creep along.

‘I blame you!’ exclaimed Nicholas.

‘This place fills me with a dreadful sensation,’ said Thomas, ‘of having
something to do.  Remove me, Francis.’

The snows lie thick around us
In the dark and gloomy night;
And the tempest wails above us,
And the stars have hid their light;
But blacker was the darkness
Round Calvary's Cross that day;--
Oh Lamb of God who takest
The sin of the world away,
Have mercy on us.

"Noblest and best of women!" said Pinto, kissing the sheet of paper
with much reverence.  "My good Mr. Roundabout, I suppose you do not
question THAT signature?"

‘Well, I will say,’ observed Mrs. Nickleby, as she took her seat, ‘that
there never was such a good creature as Smike. Upon my word, the pains
he has taken in putting this little arbour to rights, and training the
sweetest flowers about it, are beyond anything I could have--I wish he
wouldn’t put ALL the gravel on your side, Kate, my dear, though, and
leave nothing but mould for me.’

‘And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?’ asked the
old lady, after a pause.

Here Mr. Jackson cast his eye on the parchment; and resting his hands
on the table, and looking round with a winning and persuasive smile,
said: "Now, come; don't let's have no words about such a little matter
as this. Which of you gentlemen's name's Snodgrass?"

_Pickwick Papers._

“Don’t be warm, Jarber.  In mentioning Trottle, I have naturally relied
on my Right-Hand, who would take any trouble to gratify even a whim of
his old mistress’s.  But, if you can find out anything to help to unravel
the mystery of this House to Let, I shall be fully as much obliged to you
as if there was never a Trottle in the land.”

Angela did not mind. It was mostly goodnatured laughter, and many of the
laughers ended by lending willing hands and hearts to the cause. It was
wonderful how the news spread through the city's purlieus that here was
a sanctuary into which cold, hunger, and fatigue dared not intrude; a
place which the lowest might enter and be made welcome, and go
unquestioned, his personal rights as carefully respected as though he
were one of the Four Hundred.

“Well, well,” says the Dean, with a sprightly air of breaking up the
little conference, “I hope Mr. Jasper’s heart may not be too much set
upon his nephew. Our affections, however laudable, in this transitory
world, should never master us; we should guide them, guide them. I find
I am not disagreeably reminded of my dinner, by hearing my dinner-bell.
Perhaps, Mr. Crisparkle, you will, before going home, look in on
Jasper?”

The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied
only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer
her. To him, Nancy repeated her request.

"Now," said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap with his cane which
made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots, "is that
physicking over?"

“Ponies, I am,” said Polly, “especially when their tails are long.  But
horses—n—no—too big, you know.”

“By all means.”

“Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies—nothing forgotten?” inquired Toby,
fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.

‘He, he!  Mr. Alfred, her old playfellow too, you remember, Mr. Craggs,’
said Snitchey, with a disconcerted laugh; ‘knew her almost from a baby!’

He made no move towards them, but waited patiently on the dark side of
the street, until they were tired of strolling backwards and forwards
and walked away in company. Then he followed, but at some distance:
keeping them in view, without appearing to have that object, or being
seen by them.

We drove away, out of town, to the churchyard at Hornsey. ‘Better here
than in the streets,’ said my aunt. ‘He was born here.’

"Your ancestors you mean," said I smiling.

"Very well," said Mr. Pickwick, "then we will stop here."

‘You don’t mean it!’

"No, Copperfield," says he gravely, "that's not a dog. That's a boy. My
instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back. I am
sorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must do it."

I never did see such prime company as that ‘ere boy; he’ll be the
death of me, I know he will.’ Master Charley Bates, having laughed
heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.

"You hear that, all of you; you hear that?" said Mr. Benjamin Allen.

‘My name?’ returned the man. ‘No; I want to take a Alfred David.’

CHAPTER XXI

For God's sake be comforted, and bear this well, for the love of your
remaining children.

‘Mas’r Davy,’ he replied, ‘I’ve put the question to myself a mort o’
times, and never found no answer. And theer’s one curious thing--that,
though he is so pleasant, I wouldn’t fare to feel comfortable to try and
get his mind upon ‘t. He never said a wured to me as warn’t as dootiful
as dootiful could be, and it ain’t likely as he’d begin to speak any
other ways now; but it’s fur from being fleet water in his mind, where
them thowts lays. It’s deep, sir, and I can’t see down.’

"Annie, don't be absurd," returned her mother. "If you are to blush to
hear of such things, now you are an old married woman, when are you not
to blush to hear of them?"

"But the fame----" I was beginning.

“There are two men on deck. One is heavily built, gray-headed; the other
is spare, short, with red hair. There is a blood-mark on his chin.”

‘Well,’ replied the King, ‘I an’t a stranger, I assure you, to black
eyes; a bill-sticker ought to know how to handle his fists a bit.  As to
that row I have mentioned, that grew out of competition, conducted in an
uncompromising spirit.  Besides a man in a horse-and-shay continually
following us about, the company had a watchman on duty, night and day, to
prevent us sticking bills upon the hoarding in Trafalgar Square.  We went
there, early one morning, to stick bills and to black-wash their bills if
we were interfered with.  We were interfered with, and I gave the word
for laying on the wash.  It was laid on—pretty brisk—and we were all
taken to Queen Square: but they couldn’t fine me.  I knew that,’—with a
bright smile—‘I’d only give directions—I was only the General.’  Charmed
with this monarch’s affability, I inquired if he had ever hired a
hoarding himself.

‘At his journey’s end. His boat’s hauled up for three days. I heard
him give the order. Then, I saw him wait for her and meet her. I saw
them’—he stopped as though he were suffocating, and began again—‘I saw
them walking side by side, last night.’

I was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply, but that
if ever I borrowed money of anyone, I would borrow it of her. Next to
accepting a large sum on the spot, I believe this gave Peggotty more
comfort than anything I could have done.

"No, thank you," I replied.

The mention of this latter justly-celebrated clown reminds us of his
last piece of humour, the fraudulently obtaining certain stamped
acceptances from a young gentleman in the army. We had scarcely laid
down our pen to contemplate for a few moments this admirable actor's
performance of that exquisite practical joke, than a new branch of our
subject flashed suddenly upon us. So we take it up again at once.

‘Hem!’ coughed Sir Joseph.  ‘Mr. Fish, if you’ll have the goodness to
attend—’

'I am retained in that, am I?' said the Serjeant.

‘My name is Blandois.’

“I hope they are,” said Mr. Pickwick fixing his eyes upon his friend.
“You see nothing extraordinary in these stockings, _as_ stockings, I
trust Sir?”

He opened, as he spoke, a cupboard close to where he sat, and produced
some miniature boxes, carved in a homely manner and made of old wood.

‘Who’d believe me?’ replied Job Trotter. ‘The young lady’s considered
the very picture of innocence and discretion. She’d deny it, and so
would my master. Who’d believe me? I should lose my place, and get
indicted for a conspiracy, or some such thing; that’s all I should take
by my motion.’

‘Uncle,’ said Kate, when she judged they must be near their destination,
‘I must ask one question of you. I am to live at home?’

The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble’s eye rested, was the
following advertisement.

"Tell me what it is," she said, in a low voice.

"It was but the gentleman which died here before yourself," said Mrs.
Crupp, "that fell in love--with a barmaid--and had his waistcoats took
in directly, though much swelled by drinking."

‘Yes,’ said the stranger. ‘A boy was born there.’

‘They came, and raised her, and placed her on the bed. She lay bereft of
animation for hours; and when life, look, and speech returned, her
senses had deserted her, and she raved wildly and furiously.

As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at
heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:—

‘I haven’t got anything of the kind belonging to me,’ rejoined the
cobbler, shaking his head; ‘and if you want to meet with a good one, I’m
afraid you’ll find some difficulty in suiting yourself at this register
office.’

I am now going to the fire to try to warm myself, but have not the least
expectation of succeeding. The sitting-room has two large windows in it,
down to the ground and facing due east. The adjoining bedroom (mine) has
also two large windows in it, down to the ground and facing due east.
The very large doors are opposite the large windows, and I feel as if I
were something to eat in a pantry.

BOY PIONEER SERIES

Here Mrs Wilfer burst into tears.

‘Now take off the coat.’ Mr. Cripps complied with a sigh.

Pa looked in her face, and looked at the ground, and looked in her face
again, and declared he could never guess.

Oh! how they tramp'd and stamp'd, and flounc'd and bounc'd!
      A mercy 'twas they trod on the ground-floor,
    For through a loft they surely would have pounc'd--
      As 'twas, the earth was trembling to its core:
      Sure such _flochoolah_ dancers ne'er were seen before!

“HAVE you!”

The sound resounded through the house like thunder.
Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's
cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal
of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to
be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and
walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:
trimming his candle as he went.

‘Ye-es, a youth,’ said Mr Pecksniff. ‘He will avail himself of the
eligible opportunity which now offers, for uniting the advantages of the
best practical architectural education with the comforts of a home, and
the constant association with some who (however humble their sphere,
and limited their capacity) are not unmindful of their moral
responsibilities.’

‘Never,’ rejoined Monks; ‘nor against me either. See here! But don’t
move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.’

Lord Edward lingered to the 1st June, when his wounds assumed an
unhealthy appearance and fever set in; the death of Captain Ryan had
transpired, and the knowledge that his victim was no more added poignant
sorrow to a mind already excited too seriously. It is said that the
confusion and noise attending on the execution of a young man named
Clinch increased this mental irritation. On the 2nd of June Lord Edward
became delirious, and the attendance of a keeper from a mad-house was
deemed necessary. On the 3rd reason returned, but his strength had sunk
completely. The authorities gave a tardy consent for his brother and
sister to visit him, a concession Lord Clare had seen fit to withhold
until the last. Lady Louisa Conolly relates they saw he was cast for
death--‘The two dear brothers frequently embraced each other, to the
melting of a heart of stone; and yet God enabled both Henry and myself
to remain quite composed. As every one left the room we told him we only
were with him. He said, “That is very pleasant.” However, he remained
silent, and I then brought in the subject of Lady Edward, and told him I
had not left her until I saw her on board; and Henry told him of having
met her on the road well. He said, “And the children, too? She is a
charming woman,” and then became silent again. That expression about
Lady Edward proved to me that his senses were much lulled, and that he
did not feel his situation to be what it was; but, thank God! they were
enough alive to receive pleasure from seeing his brother and me. Dear
Henry, in particular, he looked at continually with an expression of
pleasure.’

‘Besides which, ma’am,’ resumed Bitzer, while he was polishing the table,
‘he looks to me as if he gamed.’

“No sir, I do not,” replied the girl, after a short struggle. “I am
chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave
it. I must have gone too far to turn back,—and yet I don’t know, for if
you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.
But,” she said, looking hastily round, “this fear comes over me again.
I must go home.”

MY DEAR WILLS,

"Do you lock your door at night when travelling?" asked Obenreizer,
standing warming his hands by the wood fire in Vendale's chamber, before
going to his own.

“Yes.”

Child, do not fear;
We shall reach our home to-night,
For the sky is clear,
And the waters bright;
And the breezes have scarcely strength
To unfold that little cloud,
That like a shroud
Spreads out its fleecy length
Then have no fear,
As we cleave our silver way
Through the waters clear.

This was the Honorable Ensign Spoonbill’s first bill-transaction, but,
the ice once broken, the second and third soon followed. He found it the
pleasantest way in the world of raising money, and in a short time his
affairs took a turn so decidedly commercial, that he applied the system
to all his mercantile transactions. He paid his tailors after this
fashion, satisfied Messrs. Mildew and his upholsterers with negotiable
paper, and did “bits of stiff” with Galloper, the horse-dealer, to a
very considerable figure. He even became facetious, not to say inspired,
by this great discovery; for, amongst his papers, when they were
afterwards overhauled by the official assignee--or some such fiscal
dignitary,--a bacchanalian song in manuscript was found, supposed to
have been written about this period, the _refrain_ of which ran as
follows:--

‘There’s mile-stones on the Dover road!’

In perturbation of mind Miss Podsnap still fumed and plucked at her
hands a little, but could not help laughing at the notion of anybody’s
being afraid of her. With that advantage, Sophronia flattered her and
rallied her more successfully, and then the insinuating Alfred flattered
her and rallied her, and promised that at any moment when she might
require that service at his hands, he would take young Fledgeby out and
trample on him. Thus it remained amicably understood that young Fledgeby
was to come to admire, and that Georgiana was to come to be admired; and
Georgiana with the entirely new sensation in her breast of having that
prospect before her, and with many kisses from her dear Sophronia in
present possession, preceded six feet one of discontented footman (an
amount of the article that always came for her when she walked home) to
her father’s dwelling.

‘Hearken to me, will you?’ returned Quilp, ‘or I’ll be a little more
pleasant, presently.  There’s no chance of his comrade and friend
returning.  The scamp has been obliged to fly, as I learn, for some
knavery, and has found his way abroad.  Let him rot there.’

"As a rule (with its exceptions like all rules) my dear Madam" says the
Major, "they have honoured me with their acquaintance, and not
unfrequently with their confidence."

"Not as a grandmamma, Cobbs?"

Scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in. It was an
office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the
figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.

_CARROLL (JOHN)_--
    FREEHAND DRAWING LESSONS FOR THE BLACK BOARD. 6s.

Of the merits of the Lowell Offering as a literary production, I will
only observe, putting entirely out of sight the fact of the articles
having been written by these girls after the arduous labours of the day,
that it will compare advantageously with a great many English Annuals.
It is pleasant to find that many of its Tales are of the Mills and of
those who work in them; that they inculcate habits of self-denial and
contentment, and teach good doctrines of enlarged benevolence.  A strong
feeling for the beauties of nature, as displayed in the solitudes the
writers have left at home, breathes through its pages like wholesome
village air; and though a circulating library is a favourable school for
the study of such topics, it has very scant allusion to fine clothes,
fine marriages, fine houses, or fine life.  Some persons might object to
the papers being signed occasionally with rather fine names, but this is
an American fashion.  One of the provinces of the state legislature of
Massachusetts is to alter ugly names into pretty ones, as the children
improve upon the tastes of their parents.  These changes costing little
or nothing, scores of Mary Annes are solemnly converted into Bevelinas
every session.

"For money which I paid him," said Miss Dartle to me.

She marries again,--may we say, loves? If she has loved before, we may
not. _He_ is in the grave, and her "heart is in the coffin there." But
she marries; and, though she may exclaim,

Major Pawkins (a gentleman of Pennsylvanian origin) was distinguished by
a very large skull, and a great mass of yellow forehead; in deference
to which commodities it was currently held in bar-rooms and other such
places of resort that the major was a man of huge sagacity. He was
further to be known by a heavy eye and a dull slow manner; and for being
a man of that kind who--mentally speaking--requires a deal of room to
turn himself in. But, in trading on his stock of wisdom, he invariably
proceeded on the principle of putting all the goods he had (and more)
into his window; and that went a great way with his constituency of
admirers. It went a great way, perhaps, with Mr Jefferson Brick, who
took occasion to whisper in Martin’s ear:

It is curious to see London gone mad. Down in the Strand here, the
monomaniacal tricks it is playing are grievous to behold, but along
Fleet Street and Cheapside it gradually becomes frenzied, dressing
itself up in all sorts of odds and ends, and knocking itself about in a
most amazing manner. At London Bridge it raves, principally about the
Kings of Denmark and their portraits. I have been looking among them for
Hamlet's uncle, and have discovered one personage with a high nose, who
I think is the man.

“I will bet—or I would, if ever I did bet,” returns Mr. Crisparkle,
“that your company will have a gay entertainer this evening.”

‘How’s this?’ cried one. ‘The gentleman say they can’t make anybody
hear, and have been trying these two hours.’

I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me
aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.
“Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, the
fountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—” there I
delicately stopped.

Saving--for there is a reservation; and even Mr Dennis was not perfectly
happy--saving for one circumstance; to wit, the forcible detention of
Dolly and Miss Haredale, in a house almost adjoining his own. This was
a stumbling-block; for if they were discovered and released, they could,
by the testimony they had it in their power to give, place him in a
situation of great jeopardy; and to set them at liberty, first extorting
from them an oath of secrecy and silence, was a thing not to be thought
of. It was more, perhaps, with an eye to the danger which lurked in this
quarter, than from his abstract love of conversation with the sex, that
the hangman, quickening his steps, now hastened into their society,
cursing the amorous natures of Hugh and Mr Tappertit with great
heartiness, at every step he took.

BROWN HAT.  For the defendant, sir.

Nicholas, with becoming gallantry, immediately took Miss La Creevy at
her word, who uttered a faint scream and slapped his face; but it was
not a very hard slap, and that’s the truth.

Little Marian, whom her profligate mother had abandoned, grew up to be
a fine girl, and a handsome. She became, moreover, heiress to Marshton
Hall, and brought the estate into the Ingoldsby family by her marriage
with one of its scions.

“Down? Weighs o’ the back?” said the old man; “ay, my lad, I was fain
to sit down; it does weigh o’ th’ back, sure enough.”

‘Instantly, sir,’ said the lady.

Short girl--black eyes--niece Emily.’

CHAPTER XXII-ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SIXTH PART THE FIRST

"You fear the world too much," she answered, gently. "All your other
hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its
sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by
one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?"

‘We are quite safe now, and have nothing to fear indeed, dear
grandfather,’ she said.

He crossed by St Paul’s and went down, at a long angle, almost to the
water’s edge, through some of the crooked and descending streets which
lie (and lay more crookedly and closely then) between the river and
Cheapside. Passing, now the mouldy hall of some obsolete Worshipful
Company, now the illuminated windows of a Congregationless Church that
seemed to be waiting for some adventurous Belzoni to dig it out and
discover its history; passing silent warehouses and wharves, and here
and there a narrow alley leading to the river, where a wretched little
bill, FOUND DROWNED, was weeping on the wet wall; he came at last to the
house he sought. An old brick house, so dingy as to be all but black,
standing by itself within a gateway. Before it, a square court-yard
where a shrub or two and a patch of grass were as rank (which is saying
much) as the iron railings enclosing them were rusty; behind it,
a jumble of roots. It was a double house, with long, narrow,
heavily-framed windows. Many years ago, it had had it in its mind to
slide down sideways; it had been propped up, however, and was leaning on
some half-dozen gigantic crutches: which gymnasium for the neighbouring
cats, weather-stained, smoke-blackened, and overgrown with weeds,
appeared in these latter days to be no very sure reliance.

Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,
Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the
pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the
person in the adjoining room.

‘If anybody comes on office business, take their messages, and say that
the gentleman who attends to that matter isn’t in at present, will
you?’ said Miss Brass.

There's a fee in the hand of the priest!
      There's a kiss on the cheek of the bride!
    And the guest she expected the least
      Is He who now sits by her side!
    Oh, well may the loiterer fail,
      _His_ love is the grape of the Rhine;
    And the spirit most sure to prevail
      Was never the spirit of wine.

‘Vell,’ said Mr. Weller, who had grown rather restless during this
discussion, ‘vith regard to bis’ness.’

“And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,” Mr. Lorry
glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, “you can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The
Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
getting of them out of harm’s way, is within the power (without loss of
precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall
I hang back, when Tellson’s knows this and says this--Tellson’s, whose
bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!”

‘And wery creditable in him, too,’ interposed Mr. Weller.

The two pilgrims, often pressing each other’s hands, or exchanging a
smile or cheerful look, pursued their way in silence.  Bright and happy
as it was, there was something solemn in the long, deserted streets,
from which, like bodies without souls, all habitual character and
expression had departed, leaving but one dead uniform repose, that made
them all alike.  All was so still at that early hour, that the few pale
people whom they met seemed as much unsuited to the scene, as the
sickly lamp which had been here and there left burning, was powerless
and faint in the full glory of the sun.

“Ah!  But you should know my father,” she replied.  “His is the happy
disposition!—Don’t mind, sir!”  For his reserve took the alarm at a step
upon the stairs, and he distrusted that he would be set down for a
troublesome intruder.  “This is my father coming.”

[Illustration: OLIVER CROMWELL AND IRETON AT THE BLUE BOAR--Chap.
xxxiii., Fourth Part]

‘What!’ cried the Jew, ‘alone?’

‘Plainly this, then,’ said the son, with an air of great concern, ‘that
I know where you were last night--from being on the spot, indeed--and
whom you saw, and what your purpose was.’

Mrs General sent up her compliments in good time next day, and hoped
he had rested well after this fatiguing journey. He sent down his
compliments, and begged to inform Mrs General that he had rested very
well indeed, and was in high condition. Nevertheless, he did not come
forth from his own rooms until late in the afternoon; and, although he
then caused himself to be magnificently arrayed for a drive with
Mrs General and his daughter, his appearance was scarcely up to his
description of himself.

[Sidenote: Mr. W. C. Macready.]

“Ay,” said the Captain, reverentially; “it’s a almighty element.
There’s wonders in the deep, my pretty. Think on it when the winds is
roaring and the waves is rowling. Think on it when the stormy nights is
so pitch dark,” said the Captain, solemnly holding up his hook, “as you
can’t see your hand afore you, excepting when the wiwid lightning
reweals the same; and when you drive, drive, drive through the storm
and dark, as if you was a driving, head on, to the world without end,
evermore, amen, and when found making a note of. Them’s the times, my
beauty, when a man may say to his messmate (previously a overhauling of
the wollume), ‘A stiff nor’wester’s blowing, Bill; hark, don’t you hear
it roar now! Lord help ’em, how I pitys all unhappy folks ashore now!’”
Which quotation, as particularly applicable to the terrors of the
ocean, the Captain delivered in a most impressive manner, concluding
with a sonorous “Stand by!”

With his rapid native action, his hands made the outline of a high hook
nose, pushed his eyes near together, dishevelled his hair, puffed out
his upper lip to represent a thick moustache, and threw the heavy end
of an ideal cloak over his shoulder. While doing this, with a swiftness
incredible to one who has not watched an Italian peasant, he indicated a
very remarkable and sinister smile. The whole change passed over him
like a flash of light, and he stood in the same instant, pale and
astonished, before his patron.

It would be tedious if given in the beadle’s words: occupying, as it
did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance
of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious
parents. That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities
than treachery, ingratitude, and malice. That he had terminated his
brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary
and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the
night-time from his master’s house. In proof of his really being the
person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the
papers he had brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then
awaited Mr. Brownlow’s observations.

The sleeper staggered to his feet, and hurried after him. John quickly
returned, ushering in with great attention and deference (for Mr
Haredale was his landlord) the long-expected visitor, who strode into
the room clanking his heavy boots upon the floor; and looking keenly
round upon the bowing group, raised his hat in acknowledgment of their
profound respect.

"There was no mistaking these signs.  It was clear that she loved
me; and it was no less clear that I, taking fire at this discovery,
was myself rapidly falling in love.  I will not keep you from my
story by idle reflections.  Take another cigar."  He rose and paced
up and down the room in silence.

More attention and concentration came into John Jasper’s eyes as they
caught sight of Mr. Grewgious smoothing his head again, and again
looking at the fire; but now, with a compressed and determined mouth.

The thought passed through my mind that in the face of my companion,
as he looked upon her without speech or motion, I might have read his
niece’s history, if I had known nothing of it. I never saw, in any
painting or reality, horror and compassion so impressively blended. He
shook as if he would have fallen; and his hand--I touched it with my
own, for his appearance alarmed me--was deadly cold.

Ever, my dear Wills, faithfully yours.

Oliver got up, walked across the room, and stooped for an instant to
raise the pitcher. When he turned his head the box was gone.

They drifted farther apart, and the old man constantly widened the
breach between them. They had been married six years, and the baby girl
was four years old, when Ben struck Edith a blow, one day, and told her
to take her child and leave the house.

"Up with the portcullis! down with the bridge!" said Sir Ralph; and out
he sallied, followed by the _élite_ of his retainers. Then there was
a pretty to-do. Heads flew one way--arms and legs another; round went
Tickletoby, and, wherever it alighted, down came horse and man: the
Baron excelled himself that day. All that he had done in Palestine faded
in the comparison; he had fought for fun there, but now it was for life
and lands. Away went John de Northwood; away went William of Hever, and
Roger of Leybourne. Hamo de Crevecoeur, with the church vassals and
the banner of St. Austin, had been gone some time. The siege was raised,
and the Lord of Sheppey left alone in his glory.

My Lord Tomnoddy jump'd up at the news,
        "Run to M'Fuze,
        And Lieutenant Tregooze,
    And run to Sir Carnaby Jenks, of the Blues.
        Rope-dancers a score
        I've seen before--
    Madame Sacchi, Antonio, and Master Blackmore;
        But to see a man swing
        At the end of a string,
    With his neck in a noose, will be quite a new thing!"

It was a sad sight to see the Major's countenance drop, and I pitied the
good soul with all my heart.

Notwithstanding the emphatic nature of this farewell, Mr Toots, instead
of going away, stood leering about him, vacantly. Florence, to relieve
him, bade adieu, with many thanks, to Lady Skettles, and gave her arm
to Sir Barnet.

"But, pardon!" said Madame Bonclet, angling for a clew, "one cannot light
a little girl, or send her to be repaired?"

The clerk smiled faintly.

“Who can help it!” echoed the children, in a joyful chorus. And they
danced and trooped about her again, and clung to her, and laid their rosy
faces against her dress, and kissed and fondled it, and could not fondle
it, or her, enough.

"But he had gained, unconsciously," said Marion, with a gentle smile,
"another heart, before I knew that I had one to give him. That
heart--yours, my sister--was so yielded up, in all its other tenderness,
to me; was so devoted, and so noble; that it plucked its love away,
and kept its secret from all eyes but mine--Ah! what other eyes were
quickened by such tenderness and gratitude!--and was content to
sacrifice itself to me. But I knew something of its depths. I knew the
struggle it had made. I knew its high, inestimable worth to him, and his
appreciation of it, let him love me as he would. I knew the debt I owed
it. I had its great example every day before me. What you had done for
me, I knew that I could do, Grace, if I would, for you. I never laid my
head down on my pillow, but I prayed with tears to do it. I never laid
my head down on my pillow, but I thought of Alfred's own words, on the
day of his departure, and how truly he had said (for I knew that, by
you) that there were victories gained every day, in struggling hearts,
to which these fields of battle were as nothing. Thinking more and more
upon the great endurance cheerfully sustained, and never known or cared
for, that there must be every day and hour, in that great strife of
which he spoke, my trial seemed to grow light and easy: and He who knows
our hearts, my dearest, at this moment, and who knows there is no drop
of bitterness or grief--of anything but unmixed happiness--in mine,
enabled me to make the resolution that I never would be Alfred's wife.
That he should be my brother, and your husband, if the course I took
could bring that happy end to pass; but that I never would (Grace, I
then loved him dearly, dearly!) be his wife!"

‘A1,’ replied Mr. Roker.

“No more it has,” said Charley. “Why don’t you put yourself under
Fagin, Oliver?”

The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago,
almost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all
round her, seeing no help.  ‘Rachael, we must lose not a moment.  We must
go in different directions, seeking aid.  You shall go by the way we have
come, and I will go forward by the path.  Tell any one you see, and every
one what has happened.  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!’

“MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE

‘I am much obliged to you, I am sure,’ said Miss Bella, coldly shaking
her curls, ‘but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all.’

Lightly armed with a paper-knife buttoned up under his jacket, and
waving the dreaded black flag at the end of a cane, the Colonel took
command of me at 2 P.M. on the eventful and appointed day. He had drawn
out the plan of attack on a piece of paper which was rolled up round a
hoop-stick. He showed it to me. My position and my full-length portrait
(but my real ears don't stick out horizontal) was behind a
corner-lamp-post, with written orders to remain there till I should see
Miss Drowvey fall. The Drowvey who was to fall was the one in
spectacles, not the one with the large lavender bonnet. At that signal I
was to rush forth, seize my Bride, and fight my way to the lane. There,
a junction would be effected between myself and the Colonel; and putting
our Brides behind us, between ourselves and the palings, we were to
conquer or die.

Perhaps it is not taking a liberty--perhaps it is--to congratulate you
on Kenyon's remembrance. Either way I can't help doing it with all my
heart, for I know no man in the world (myself excepted) to whom I would
rather the money went.

The following story is one of many which has drifted down to us from
the story-loving nurseries and hearthstones of Germany. I cannot recall
when I first had it told to me as a child, varied of course by
different tellers, but always leaving that sweet, tender impression of
God's loving care for the least of his children. I have since read
different versions of it in at least a half-dozen story books for
children.

"You're wery good, sir," replied Mr. Roker, accepting the proffered
glass. "Yours, sir."

I am favoured with your note of yesterday's date, and lose no time in
replying to it.

‘Too poor?’ returned the blind man with a sigh. ‘Ay. That’s bad. Your
mother, poor soul, would be happier if she was richer, Barnaby.’

One of the most comical spectacles I have ever seen in my life was
"church," with a heavy sea on, in the saloon of the Cunard steamer
coming out. The officiating minister, an extremely modest young man, was
brought in between two big stewards, exactly as if he were coming up to
the scratch in a prize-fight. The ship was rolling and pitching so, that
the two big stewards had to stop and watch their opportunity of making a
dart at the reading-desk with their reverend charge, during which pause
he held on, now by one steward and now by the other, with the feeblest
expression of countenance and no legs whatever. At length they made a
dart at the wrong moment, and one steward was immediately beheld alone
in the extreme perspective, while the other and the reverend gentleman
_held on by the mast_ in the middle of the saloon--which the latter
embraced with both arms, as if it were his wife. All this time the
congregation was breaking up into sects and sliding away; every sect (as
in nature) pounding the other sect. And when at last the reverend
gentleman had been tumbled into his place, the desk (a loose one, put
upon the dining-table) deserted from the church bodily, and went over to
the purser. The scene was so extraordinarily ridiculous, and was made so
much more so by the exemplary gravity of all concerned in it, that I was
obliged to leave before the service began.

“Yes,” he replied; “I wish to come in, master.”

"Why, you see, Dot," John made answer slowly, as he unrolled a shawl
from about his throat, and warmed his hands; "it--it an't exactly summer
weather. So no wonder."

‘Ran away, the Mulatto wench Mary.  Has a cut on the left arm, a scar
    on the left shoulder, and two upper teeth missing.’

‘Mine!’ said the Secretary. ‘My life!’

One night, a fellow engaged as a carpenter, and whose business it
likewise was to assist in holding a carpet in which the pantomime
characters are caught when they jump through the scenes, went to
Ellar, who was the Harlequin, and holding up the carpet, said that it
was very dry, thereby intimating in the cant phrase that he required
something to drink. Ellar, from some cause or other, either because
he had already fee'd the men liberally, or was engaged at the moment
in conversation, returned some slight answer, unaccompanied by the
required gratuity, and the fellow went away grumbling. On the following
evening, Ellar was informed that the man had been heard to talk about
being revenged upon him: he only laughed at the threat, however, and
all went on as usual until the third night afterwards, when, as he and
Grimaldi were on the stage together, in the scene where he used to jump
through the "moon," and after the former had given the cue for him
to take the leap, he was surprised to observe that he hesitated, and
still more so when, drawing close to him, he said, in a whisper, "I am
afraid they don't mean to catch me. I have knocked three times against
the scene, and asked if they were ready; but nobody has said a word in
reply."

Mrs. Cannon reluctantly swept out of the room, followed by all the
young ladies and the _young men_.

By little and little, he got tired of the bustle of the day, the noise
of carriages and carts, and people passing and repassing; and would
fall asleep, or be troubled with a restless and uneasy sense again—the
child could hardly tell whether this were in his sleeping or his waking
moments—of that rushing river. “Why, will it never stop, Floy?” he
would sometimes ask her. “It is bearing me away, I think!”

Hugh obeyed in silence.

Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line
of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
avail him nothing.

"I know that," said the Laird, biting his lip and looking greatly
puzzled; "but confound me if I understand this; for I was within
speech of her just now on the top of the Birky Brow there, and, when I
think of it, she could not have been even thus far as yet. She had on
a pure white gauze frock, a small green bonnet and feathers, and a
green veil, which, flung back over her left shoulder, hung below her
waist, and was altogether such an engaging figure that no man could
have passed her on the road without taking some note of her. Are you
not making game of me? Did you not really meet with her?"

‘No, no, no,’ said Eugene; shocked—to do him justice—at the thought of
trifling with her infirmity. ‘Bad for business, bad for business. If we
all set to work as soon as we could use our hands, it would be all over
with the dolls’ dressmakers.’

‘Yes, Charley; I do; indeed.’

“I think,” he said, “my good friend Captain Cuttle mentioned something
about being towed along in the wake of that day. What a pity he’s so
far away!”

‘None at all that I know of sir,’ replied Dolly. ‘I should be very glad
to be near Miss Emma of course, and always am.’

“They are excellent, Sir,” said Mr Dombey.

From one of the many such defeats of one of many rent-days, Mr Pancks,
having finished his day’s collection, repaired with his note-book
under his arm to Mrs Plornish’s corner. Mr Pancks’s object was not
professional, but social. He had had a trying day, and wanted a little
brightening. By this time he was on friendly terms with the Plornish
family, having often looked in upon them at similar seasons, and borne
his part in recollections of Miss Dorrit.

It was jes' daylight and I was all black and sooty and scratched and my
arm was broken.

In such scenes and occupations the time wore on until nine o’clock, when
Kate, jaded and dispirited with the occurrences of the day, hastened
from the confinement of the workroom, to join her mother at the street
corner, and walk home:--the more sadly, from having to disguise her real
feelings, and feign to participate in all the sanguine visions of her
companion.

For a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my eyes, I
had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed
character of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so
unequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss
Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as
she said, when we had taken a good look at each other,—

“What do you call some time, now?” asked my guardian thoughtfully.

‘Now, my fine fellow!’ said the man in the rough coat, in an imperious
tone, attempting at the same time to push his way past.

“What has he done?”

"I'll mention that 'ere, sir," rejoined Sam.

“Thank you, sir. It don’t matter.”

‘Not like a lady’s hand, is it?’ said Traddles.

"I--I do a little in that way," replied Mr. Snodgrass, rather taken
aback by the abruptness of the question.

Fifty things came up as she stood there before him, some of them
floating in from the past, others hovering with freshness: how she
used to dodge the rotary movement made by his pince-nez while he
always awkwardly, and kindly, and often funnily, talked--it had
once hit her rather badly in the eye; how she used to pull down and
straighten his waistcoat, making it set a little better, a thing of
a sort her mother never did; how friendly and familiar she must have
been with him for that, or else a forward little minx; how she felt
almost capable of doing it again now, just to sound the right note,
and how sure she was of the way he would take it if she did; how much
nicer he had clearly been, all the while, poor dear man, than his wife
and the court had made it possible for him publicly to appear; how
much younger, too, he now looked, in spite of his rather melancholy,
his mildly jaundiced, humorously determined sallowness and his
careless assumption, everywhere, from his forehead to his exposed and
relaxed blue socks, almost sky-blue, as in past days, of creases and
folds and furrows that would have been perhaps tragic if they hadn't
seemed rather to show, like his whimsical black eyebrows, the vague,
interrogative arch.

So he put on his hat, and went out with his cane under his arm: very
upright, and humming a tune when he was clear of the counting-house.

Mr. Martin, who was a man of few words and possessed but little
power of eloquence or persuasion, submitted to this operation with
a very calm and agreeable expression of countenance, for some
seconds; finding, however, that it threatened speedily to lead to a
result, which would place it beyond his power to claim any wages,
board or otherwise, in all time to come, he muttered an inarticulate
remonstrance and felled Mr. Benjamin Allen to the ground. As that
gentleman had his hands entangled in his cravat, he had no alternative
but to follow him to the floor. There they both lay struggling, when
the shop door opened, and the party was increased by the arrival of two
most unexpected visitors; to wit, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Samuel Weller.

And she could not but see that these revealings of a great alteration
in Walter manifested themselves in despite of his utmost efforts to
hide them. In his consideration for her, she thought, and in the
earnestness of his desire to spare her any wound from his kind hand, he
resorted to innumerable little artifices and disguises. So much the
more did Florence feel the greatness of the alteration in him; so much
the oftener did she weep at this estrangement of her brother.

Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain
the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might
be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts
with a trembling hand, and opened the door.

“Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur
Gabelle!”

While with eager eyes of wonder
Over the dark page I bent,
Slowly twilight shadows gathered
Till the letters came and went;
Slowly, till the night was round me;
Then my heart beat loud and fast,
For I felt before I saw it
That a spirit near me passed.

Boffin’s acquaintances with the names and situations of foreign lands
being limited in extent and somewhat confused in quality, he shaped his
next question on an elastic model.

I said no more.

“I tell you again, it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here
among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at
once?”

‘Yes, yes, he is,’ said Mr. Pickwick and Sam, with great earnestness.

‘Another word, Rose,’ said Harry. ‘Your reason in your own words.
From your own lips, let me hear it!’

‘My dear Agnes,’ I began, ‘if you mean Steerforth--’

That must have been a very unreasonable request on the part of Mark
Tapley, with which, in their gratitude for his kind offices on board the
ship, they would not have complied instantly. The man rose to accompany
him without a moment’s delay. Before they went, Mark took the sick child
in his arms, and tried to comfort the mother; but the hand of death was
on it then, he saw.

“May I ask the name?” I said.

As Perker spoke, Mrs. Bardell began to recover by slow degrees, while
Mrs. Cluppins, after a careful survey of Master Bardell’s buttons and
the button-holes to which they severally belonged, placed him on the
floor of the court in front of his mother--a commanding position in
which he could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of
both judge and jury. This was not done without considerable opposition,
and many tears, on the part of the young gentleman himself, who had
certain inward misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of
the judge’s eye was only a formal prelude to his being immediately
ordered away for instant execution, or for transportation beyond the
seas, during the whole term of his natural life, at the very least.

Later still in the night, we came to another parlour up a step or two
from the street, which was very cleanly, neatly, even tastefully, kept,
and in which, set forth on a draped chest of drawers masking the
staircase, was such a profusion of ornamental crockery, that it would
have furnished forth a handsome sale-booth at a fair.  It backed up a
stout old lady—HOGARTH drew her exact likeness more than once—and a boy
who was carefully writing a copy in a copy-book.

"There are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world, than
Marlborough Downs when it blows hard; and if you throw in beside, a
gloomy winter's evening, a miry and sloppy road, and a pelting fall
of heavy rain, and try the effect, by way of experiment, in your own
proper person, you will experience the full force of this observation.

“Do you think I am dying, mamma?”

"I don't see no occasion for nothin' o' the kind, sir," replied Mr.
Weller, obstinately.

‘No,’ said the other. In so surly a tone that the man, after a blank
stare, acknowledged it with the retort:

My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at Highgate; I
intending to go abroad, and she to return to her house at Dover. We had
a temporary lodging in Covent Garden. As I walked home to it, after this
evening’s conversation, reflecting on what had passed between Ham and
myself when I was last at Yarmouth, I wavered in the original purpose
I had formed, of leaving a letter for Emily when I should take leave of
her uncle on board the ship, and thought it would be better to write to
her now. She might desire, I thought, after receiving my communication,
to send some parting word by me to her unhappy lover. I ought to give
her the opportunity.

The bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and
presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who
carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his
outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.

‘It’s easy enough to understand it,’ replied the choleric old gentleman.
‘If you had been a younger man, you would have been in the secret long
ago; and besides,’ added Wardle, after a moment’s hesitation, ‘the truth
is, that, knowing nothing of this matter, I have rather pressed Emily
for four or five months past, to receive favourably (if she could; I
would never attempt to force a girl’s inclinations) the addresses of a
young gentleman down in our neighbourhood. I have no doubt that, girl-
like, to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of Mr. Snodgrass,
she has represented this matter in very glowing colours, and that they
have both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly-persecuted
pair of unfortunates, and have no resource but clandestine matrimony, or
charcoal. Now the question is, what’s to be done?’

“No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide
with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”

‘If trial and calamity had fallen as lightly on his head, as in the
deepest truth of my own heart I ever hoped (for her sake) it would, his
life would have been one of peace and happiness,’ said the old gentleman
calmly. ‘It will be enough to say that this was not the case; that
she was not happy; that they fell into complicated distresses and
difficulties; that she came, twelve months before her death, to appeal
to my old friendship; sadly changed, sadly altered, broken-spirited from
suffering and ill-usage, and almost broken-hearted. He readily availed
himself of the money which, to give her but one hour’s peace of mind,
I would have poured out as freely as water--nay, he often sent her back
for more--and yet even while he squandered it, he made the very success
of these, her applications to me, the groundwork of cruel taunts and
jeers, protesting that he knew she thought with bitter remorse of the
choice she had made, that she had married him from motives of interest
and vanity (he was a gay young man with great friends about him when
she chose him for her husband), and venting in short upon her, by every
unjust and unkind means, the bitterness of that ruin and disappointment
which had been brought about by his profligacy alone. In those times
this young lady was a mere child. I never saw her again until that
morning when you saw her also, but my nephew, Frank--’

‘Tottle, will you “go in?”’ inquired Mr. Gabriel Parsons, as he
approached him, wiping the perspiration off his face.

‘Yes,’ said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.

“Now, young woman!” said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a
door behind her, “who do you want here?”

"Ah--ah, my dear sir," said the little man, advancing to meet him;
"very happy to see you, my dear sir, very. Pray sit down. So you have
carried your intention into effect. You have come down here to see an
election--eh?"

‘There’s nobody but corpses to buy ‘em,’ said Mr Tapley, shaking his
head with a rueful air, ‘and pigs.’

Into it went Mr. Squeers, and Ralph, and the third man, whom Newman Noggs
had never seen. Newman stood upon the door-step to see them off, not
troubling himself to wonder where or upon what business they were going,
until he chanced by mere accident to hear Ralph name the address whither
the coachman was to drive.
