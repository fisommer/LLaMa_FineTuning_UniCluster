I AM THE BEARER OF EVIL TIDINGS                                566

I am not (said the poor relation, looking at the fire as he slowly rubbed
his hands) very rich, for I never cared to be that; but I have enough,
and am above all moderate wants and anxieties.  My Castle is not a
splendid place, but it is very comfortable, and it has a warm and
cheerful air, and is quite a picture of Home.

‘Lor!’ said the cherub.

“Nonsense, mother,” said Wardle. “Come, come, don’t be cross, there’s a
good soul. Recollect Bella; come, you must keep her spirits up, poor
girl.”

I never saw Agnes laugh so. This sudden ecstasy on the part of Mr.
Peggotty was so delightful to her, that she could not leave off
laughing; and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh, and the
greater Mr. Peggotty’s ecstasy became, and the more he rubbed his legs.

CHAPTER 65

|It was a fresh and beautiful morning, though the sun was scarcely
risen, and a thin silvery mist hung like a veil over the smooth surface
of the water. Two or three watermen were lying asleep in their tilts,
and they roused one of them, who speedily rowed them to the opposite
bank, near which they found Mr. Hewitt, with two brace of swords under
his arm, in addition to the one by his side, accompanied by a tall stout
man, with a red face, dressed in a well-powdered wig, and a suit of
purple velvet, and carrying a gold-headed cane, who was introduced as
Mr. Molson, the surgeon.

"I'm sure I don't know why I should. But if I do, you must promise me,
on your honor, never to tell him, if you ever meet him again."

_Mr. C. sen._--Hear, haughty madam, while my mind I speak,
  If Bob don't mend--(_a long pause_)--I'll marry this day week!
  I'll have boys too-- (_A sudden fit of coughing interrupts him._)

"Oh! he is your servant, is he?" said Mr. Nupkins. "A conspiracy
to defeat the ends of justice, and murder its officers. Pickwick's
servant. Put that down, Mr. Jinks."

"Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?"
inquired the sergeant.

"I don't know what that means," replied Oliver, looking round.

"It's like a dream," ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, "a hideous dream. The
idea of a man's walking about, all day, with a dreadful horse that he
can't get rid of!" The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away, with
a tall quadruped, for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust,
following slowly at their heels.

Mr James walked to the other end of the room. I did not know what to
do. I feared that my gay voice grieved them, for I saw something had
made them unhappy. Little did I think the blow was falling on my own
unfortunate head.

Mr Baptist in his vivacious way repeating the word several times, Mr
Pancks in his duller way gave it him back once. From that time it became
a frequent custom with Pancks the gipsy, as he went home jaded at night,
to pass round by Bleeding Heart Yard, go quietly up the stairs, look in
at Mr Baptist’s door, and, finding him in his room, to say, ‘Hallo, old
chap! Altro!’ To which Mr Baptist would reply with innumerable bright
nods and smiles, ‘Altro, signore, altro, altro, altro!’ After this
highly condensed conversation, Mr Pancks would go his way with an
appearance of being lightened and refreshed.

‘May the present moment,’ said Dick, sticking his fork into a large
carbuncular potato, ‘be the worst of our lives! I like the plan of
sending ‘em with the peel on; there’s a charm in drawing a potato from
its native element (if I may so express it) to which the rich and
powerful are strangers. Ah! “Man wants but little here below, nor wants
that little long!” How true that is!--after dinner.’

"On the wings of the wind," replied the Ghost.

Nicholas gave the promise; he had few words to give it in, but they were
solemn and earnest. His poor friend kept his hand in his, and turned as
if to sleep. But there were stifled sobs; and the hand was pressed
more than once, or twice, or thrice, before he sank to rest, and slowly
loosed his hold.

‘You may go, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

‘No one is useless in this world,’ retorted the Secretary, ‘who lightens
the burden of it for any one else.’

Mr. Pickwick concluded amidst a whirlwind of applause; and once more
were the lungs of the supernumeraries, under Mr. Weller’s command,
brought into active and efficient operation. Mr. Wardle proposed Mr.
Pickwick; Mr. Pickwick proposed the old lady. Mr. Snodgrass proposed Mr.
Wardle; Mr. Wardle proposed Mr. Snodgrass. One of the poor relations
proposed Mr. Tupman, and the other poor relation proposed Mr. Winkle;
all was happiness and festivity, until the mysterious disappearance of
both the poor relations beneath the table, warned the party that it was
time to adjourn.

The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,
though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still
present to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious
of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected
with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares
long, long, forgotten!

CHAP. XXXVIII. A Dissolution of Partnership                    385

No notice being taken of the taps, the unseen visitor, after a short
lapse, ventured to open the door and peep in. It was no female head that
was thrust in at the partially-opened door, but the long black locks and
red face of Mr. Stiggins. Mr. Weller’s pipe fell from his hands.

“Let me see; he’ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,” said Mr.
Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. “It will
be dark by that time.”

‘Very neat!’ said Mrs Gowan, coolly unfurling her screen. ‘Very happy!
From which I infer that you secretly think her manner equal to her
looks?’

‘Oh!  Alfred sent the music, did he?’ returned the Doctor.

He brought the watch to the bank, swam to the Weir again, climbed it,
and dived off. He knew every hole and corner of all the depths, and
dived and dived and dived, until he could bear the cold no more. His
notion was, that he would find the body; he only found a shirt-pin
sticking in some mud and ooze.

Three o’clock, and half-past three, and they had passed over London
Bridge. They had heard the rush of the tide against obstacles; and
looked down, awed, through the dark vapour on the river; had seen little
spots of lighted water where the bridge lamps were reflected, shining
like demon eyes, with a terrible fascination in them for guilt and
misery. They had shrunk past homeless people, lying coiled up in
nooks. They had run from drunkards. They had started from slinking men,
whistling and signing to one another at bye corners, or running away at
full speed. Though everywhere the leader and the guide, Little Dorrit,
happy for once in her youthful appearance, feigned to cling to and rely
upon Maggy. And more than once some voice, from among a knot of brawling
or prowling figures in their path, had called out to the rest to ‘let
the woman and the child go by!’

He then turned into one of the side walks, and approached the orchestra,
in front of which stood Kitty Conway, preparing to sing. She instantly
detected him, and made a slight movement of recognition. As he passed
the range of alcoves beneath the orchestra, he perceived Jacob, who
instantly came towards him.

“No, no, Mr. F., I don’t do business in that way, I shall be satisfied
with ten per cent.”

‘Because,’ said my aunt, ‘it’s all I have. Because I’m ruined, my dear!’

‘Nobody, my dear,’ replied the Jew; ‘not a soul, Tom. I don’t know
one of ‘em that would do it besides you; not one of ‘em, my dear.’

As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more
to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I
going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I
believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that
desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer
my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anything
but my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my
services.

His children heard with becoming reverence these moral precepts from the
lips of their father, and signified their acquiescence in the same, by
smiles. That he might the better feed and cherish that sacred flame of
gratitude in his breast, Mr Pecksniff remarked that he would trouble
his eldest daughter, even in this early stage of their journey, for the
brandy-bottle. And from the narrow neck of that stone vessel he imbibed
a copious refreshment.

Blustering assertion goes for proof half
                over the world.

‘It is not,’ assented Alfred, with a glittering smile and a great deal
of nose, ‘not impossible.’

11.  THE TESTIMONY OF MR. HOME’S BOOTS

Sir--I disdain to reply to Mr. Cruikshank’s preposterous assertions,
except to give them, as before, a flat contradiction.--Your faithful
servant, W. Harrison Ainsworth.

After this decision, which his friends and himself looked upon as
a complete triumph, they bowed to the magistrate and quitted the
Police-office, Grimaldi previously paying the five shillings which he
had been fined, and an additional shilling for his discharge. It was
then proposed and unanimously agreed that the party should adjourn to
a tavern,[24] called the King of Prussia (now bearing the sign of the
Clown), opposite Sadler's Wells theatre, for the purpose of having some
lunch; and thither they proceeded, and made themselves very merry with
the mortified looks of Old Lucas, mingling with their mirth some dry
and abstruse speculations upon the nature of the laws which compelled
a magistrate to accept the oath of a reputed perjurer, and to convict
upon it a person whom he conscientiously believed to be innocent of the
offence laid to his charge.

‘Listen to what I say!’ she said; ‘and reserve your false arts for your
dupes. Do you hope to move me by your tears? No more than you could
charm me by your smiles, you purchased slave.’

Snore, a mighty, i. 158

"A young friend of mine, my dear," replied the Jew.

“I wonder whether _they_ can hear it,” said Nancy.

"What do you mean?" inquired the Hermit, with a furious air.

"The name, sir.  The name keeps the Post-office."

Here the Mayor was interrupted by a voice in the crowd.

"Sir," called out Mr. Weller to his master.

“‘Which don’t break open for a year, or until you have decisive
intelligence of my dear Walter, who is dear to you, Ned, too, I am
sure.’” The Captain paused and shook his head in some emotion; then, as
a re-establishment of his dignity in this trying position, looked with
exceeding sternness at the Grinder. “‘If you should never hear of me,
or see me more, Ned, remember an old friend as he will remember you to
the last—kindly; and at least until the period I have mentioned has
expired, keep a home in the old place for Walter. There are no debts,
the loan from Dombey’s House is paid off and all my keys I send with
this. Keep this quiet, and make no inquiry for me; it is useless. So no
more, dear Ned, from your true friend, Solomon Gills.’” The Captain
took a long breath, and then read these words written below: “‘The boy
Rob, well recommended, as I told you, from Dombey’s House. If all else
should come to the hammer, take care, Ned, of the little Midshipman.’”

"I think that's prudent," returned Mr. Groves.  "You shall have your
suppers directly."

Miss Blimber, the doctor's daughter, a learned lady in spectacles, was
his special tutor, and from morning till night his poor little brains
were forced and crammed till his head was heavy and always had a dull
ache in it, and his small legs grew weak again--every day he looked a
little thinner and a little paler, and became more old-fashioned than
ever in his looks and ways--"old-fashioned" was a distinguishing title
which clung to him. He was gentle and polite to every one--always
looking out for small kindnesses which he might do to any inmate of the
house. "The oddest and most old-fashioned child in the world," Dr.
Blimber would say to his daughter; "but bring him on, Cornelia--bring
him on."

‘It is my sight restored.  It is my sight!’ she cried.  ‘I have been
blind, and now my eyes are open.  I never knew him!  To think I might
have died, and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to me!’

“But night is coming on,” says he, “and my Lady will take cold. My
dear, let us go in.”

He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his
committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken
two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great
pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his
hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke
very little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the
first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he
ought to hear.

Mr. Peggotty suggesting to me, in a whisper, what had already occurred
to myself, I took out my purse; but I could not prevail upon her to
accept any money, nor could I exact any promise from her that she would
do so at another time. I represented to her that Mr. Peggotty could
not be called, for one in his condition, poor; and that the idea of her
engaging in this search, while depending on her own resources, shocked
us both. She continued steadfast. In this particular, his influence
upon her was equally powerless with mine. She gratefully thanked him but
remained inexorable.

‘Ay, indeed!’ cried Hugh; ‘this suits me!’

"Why, my dear Dick," said Durfy, "as Murphy has had two shots, and the
squire has not had the return of either, he declares he will not fire at
him again; and, under these circumstances, I must take my man off the
ground."

"Why," he said, "I suppose--"

Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers?

‘--And a rainy night,’ added the stout man.

SCROOGE--Brown old-fashioned coat, tea colour breeches, double-breasted
white waistcoat. 2nd.--Dressing gown and slippers.

Mr. Sikes, being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot
water with his gin to render it less inflammatory, and had pushed his
glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time,
when these symptoms first struck him.

“Been along with your friend again, Bart?”

The Doctor laughed, and looked at Alfred.

‘Very cold, indeed, sir,’ replied the mistress, in her most civil
tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.

"Good-bye, Pip!" said Miss Havisham, after my papers were signed.  "Let
them out, Estella."

“As to our being a pack of thieves, Mr. Landless,” said the man, as he
spat out some blood, and wiped more from his face; “you know better
than that at midday. We wouldn’t have touched you if you hadn’t forced
us. We’re going to take you round to the high road, anyhow, and you’ll
find help enough against thieves there, if you want it.—Wipe his face,
somebody; see how it’s a-trickling down him!”

I must begin to look out for the box of bon-bons for the noble and
fascinating Plornish-Maroon. Give him my love and a thousand kisses.

Firmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both Mr. and
Miss Murdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed
my comprehension of it at that time, if I had been called upon, I
nevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way, that it was another
name for tyranny; and for a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil’s humour,
that was in them both. The creed, as I should state it now, was this.
Mr. Murdstone was firm; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr.
Murdstone; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all, for everybody
was to be bent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone was an exception.
She might be firm, but only by relationship, and in an inferior and
tributary degree. My mother was another exception. She might be firm,
and must be; but only in bearing their firmness, and firmly believing
there was no other firmness upon earth.

I moved towards the door, keeping my eye fixed upon him as he sat
pale and glaring at me.

By this time they had both become savage; Mr. Neville out in the open;
Edwin Drood under the transparent cover of a popular tune, and a stop
now and then to pretend to admire picturesque effects in the moonlight
before him.

‘Yes. And to suggest,’ pursued Montague, ‘that surely you have friends;
indeed, I know you have; who would answer our purpose admirably, and
whom we should be delighted to receive.’

They ceased at last, and then the silence was so new and terrible that
it seemed the prelude to some dreadful noise. Footsteps in the court!
Two men. He fell back from the door on tiptoe, as if they could have
seen him through its wooden panels.

"Nothing!" Scrooge replied.

“Then,” said the fellow, “bottle it up, and be hanged to you! Don’t you
see it is running away to Stockington?”

‘In my beautiful new great-coat,’ answered Caleb, glancing towards a
clothes-line in the room, on which the sack-cloth garment previously
described, was carefully hung up to dry.

"On?  Yes.  Across the Alps, and down to Milan."

‘You labour under some mistake, my child!’ said Mr Pecksniff, ‘but
I will not ask you what it is; I don’t desire to know. No, pray!’ he
added, holding out his hand and colouring again, ‘let us avoid the
subject, my dear, whatever it is!’

"Do you hear that, father!" cried the blind girl in delight.

This is, we admit at once, and in anticipation of the reader's already
expressed opinion, a very poor imitation of the opening song of the
Beggar's Opera.

Miss Shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my life, how
do I ever come to break with her? I can’t conceive. And yet a coolness
grows between Miss Shepherd and myself. Whispers reach me of Miss
Shepherd having said she wished I wouldn’t stare so, and having avowed a
preference for Master Jones--for Jones! a boy of no merit whatever! The
gulf between me and Miss Shepherd widens. At last, one day, I meet the
Misses Nettingalls’ establishment out walking. Miss Shepherd makes
a face as she goes by, and laughs to her companion. All is over. The
devotion of a life--it seems a life, it is all the same--is at an end;
Miss Shepherd comes out of the morning service, and the Royal Family
know her no more.

The broadsword exercise over, suddenly there was great excitement and a
rush.  Naval Drill!

‘Cheer up, my noble sir,’ said Mr Pecksniff, taking courage, ‘and we
will do what is required of us. You shall know all, sir, and shall
be righted. But first excuse me, sir, excuse me. I have a duty to
discharge, which I owe to society.’

‘Now,’ said Lightwood, ‘what’s your name?’

‘Now, just a leetle drop,’ said Mrs. Mann persuasively.

Agassiz is one of the most natural and jovial of men. I go out
a-visiting as little as I can, but still have to dine, and what is
worse, sup pretty often. Socially, I am (as I was here before)
wonderfully reminded of Edinburgh when I had many friends in it.

Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird’s mouth
described by the term in question.

"_Cause of Justice._--John Bull _versus_ John Kemble--verdict for
     the plaintiff."

The old man rose obediently and made ready to follow.  She had already
packed their scanty belongings.  She gave him his wallet and staff, and
secretly, in the night, they fled away.

"Don't you, though?" he returned, with one of his jerks. "I'm astonished
at that, Master Copperfield, you being usually so quick! I'll try to be
plainer, another time.--Is that Mr. Maldon a-norseback, ringing at the
gate, sir?"

‘What mill! Why, _the_ mill--the mill as takes up so little room
that it’ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the
wind’s low with people, than when it’s high; acos then they can’t
get workmen. But come,’ said the young gentleman; ‘you want grub,
and you shall have it. I’m at low-water-mark myself--only one bob
and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I’ll fork out and stump. Up
with you on your pins. There! Now then! ‘Morrice!’

I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures. I
must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his
ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and
that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat; but I
kept these sentiments to myself.

“I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?”

He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came
out. Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained
off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of
their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they
had entered.

"Mama!" returned Annie. "Waste no words on me, for my appeal is to my
husband, and even you are nothing here."

"For the Church?" said I, still pondering, betweenwhiles, on Uriah Heep.

‘Stand still, you dog,’ said Quilp. ‘I won’t do it again, because I’ve
done it as often as I want. Here. Take the key.’

“When?” cried the stranger, hastily.

‘I suspect she has an attachment, Trot.’

"Wot do you mean by leavin' it on trust?" inquired Sam, waking up a
little. "If it ain't ready money, where's the use on it?"

I have found it so extremely difficult to write about America (though
never so briefly) without appearing to blow trumpets on the one hand, or
to be inconsistent with my avowed determination _not_ to write about it
on the other, that I have taken the simple course enclosed. The number
will be published on the 6th of June. It appears to me to be the most
modest and manly course, and to derive some graceful significance from
its title.

He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for
seat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground,
tried to collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a
few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had
seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. These
gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested
more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was
delivered. To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead--that was the
end. To be hanged by the neck till he was dead.

The cry came up: "He is insensible; but his heart beats.  It beats
against mine."

‘By all means,’ said the Secretary.

‘I am going for a walk round the prison, and I wish you to attend me. I
see a prisoner we know coming this way, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick,
smiling.

Nowhere more altered, perhaps, about a hundred years ago, than in one
little orchard attached to an old stone house with a honeysuckle porch:
where, on a bright autumn morning, there were sounds of music and
laughter, and where two girls danced merrily together on the grass,
while some half-dozen peasant women standing on ladders, gathering the
apples from the trees, stopped in their work to look down, and share
their enjoyment. It was a pleasant, lively, natural scene; a beautiful
day, a retired spot; and the two girls, quite unconstrained and
careless, danced in the very freedom and gaiety of their hearts.

Florence had been weak and delicate of late, and the agitation she had
undergone was not without its influences on her health. But it was no
bodily illness that affected her now. She was distressed in mind; and
the cause of her distress was Walter.

Tibbs took his head from the paper, and his feet from the fender, and
proceeded. ‘It’s very likely one of the young ladies may set her cap at
young Mr. Simpson, and you know a marriage—’

The talented Tippin having condescendingly acknowledged the clapping of
hands, and shouts of ‘bravo!’ which greeted her appearance, proceeded
to sing the popular cavatina of ‘Bid me discourse,’ accompanied on the
piano by Mr. Tippin; after which, Mr. Tippin sang a comic song,
accompanied on the piano by Mrs. Tippin: the applause consequent upon
which, was only to be exceeded by the enthusiastic approbation bestowed
upon an air with variations on the guitar, by Miss Tippin, accompanied
on the chin by Master Tippin.

Such are a few fragments from the simple but most interesting and
instructive history of Laura Bridgman.  The name of her great benefactor
and friend, who writes it, is Dr. Howe.  There are not many persons, I
hope and believe, who, after reading these passages, can ever hear that
name with indifference.

‘But now I mean to do it,’ returned the Doctor. ‘My first master will
succeed me--I am in earnest at last--so you’ll soon have to arrange our
contracts, and to bind us firmly to them, like a couple of knaves.’

Until, ascending through the floor, and pausing with his head just
raised above its beams, he came among the Bells. It was barely possible
to make out their great shapes in the gloom; but there they were.
Shadowy, and dark, and dumb.

‘It’s the finest boy I ever saw in all my life,’ said the doctor. ‘I
never saw such a baby.’

“I think not, as we dine early.”

She also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage. She had
no kind of grace about her, but the grace of sympathy; but when she
condoled with the woman, and her own tears fell, she wanted no
beauty. I say condoled, but her only words were “Jenny! Jenny!” All
the rest was in the tone in which she said them.

‘Mr. Sampson, good-day!  I presume, you see, upon your kind permission to
intrude upon you.  I don’t keep my word in being justified by business,
for my business here—if I may so abuse the word—is of the slightest
nature.’

“Or rather, to let the ground to me for that, father,” said Allan, “when
it is your own property, and you are tired of work, and disposed to turn
it over to me. I will pay you ten pounds per acre then, and let you have
all the cabbages you can eat besides. It is capital land, and that is
the truth. Come--shall that be a bargain?”

"Immediately, ma'am; this instant, ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick, opening
the door, and dropping both his shoes with a crash in so doing.

‘The master?’

Thus adjured, silently, involuntarily, I passed from the Veiled
Woman's side, over the sear lines on the turf which had been traced
by the triangles of light long since extinguished, and toward the
verge of the circle.  As I advanced, overhead rushed a dark cloud
of wings--birds dislodged from the forest on fire, and screaming,
in dissonant terror, as they flew toward the farthermost mountains;
close by my feet hissed and glided the snakes, driven forth from
their blazing coverts, and glancing through the ring, unscared by
its waning lamps; all undulating by me, bright-eyed, and hissing,
all made innocuous by fear--even the terrible Death-adder, which I
trampled on as I halted at the verge of the circle, did not turn to
bite, but crept harmless away.  I halted at the gap between the two
dead lamps, and bowed my head to look again into the crystal
vessel.  Were there, indeed, no lingering drops yet left, if but to
recruit the lamps for some priceless minutes more?  As I thus
stood, right into the gap between the two dead lamps strode a
gigantic Foot.  All the rest of the form was unseen; only, as
volume after volume of smoke poured on from the burning land
behind, it seemed as if one great column of vapor, eddying round,
settled itself aloft from the circle, and that out from that column
strode the giant Foot.  And, as strode the Foot, so with it came,
like the sound of its tread, a roll of muttered thunder.

“If I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing for
me.”

It was now eight o’clock.  After nine, none could walk the streets
without danger of their lives, and even at this hour, robberies and
murder were of no uncommon occurrence.  The shops upon the bridge were
all closed; the low wooden arches thrown across the way were like so many
black pits, in every one of which ill-favoured fellows lurked in knots of
three or four; some standing upright against the wall, lying in wait;
others skulking in gateways, and thrusting out their uncombed heads and
scowling eyes: others crossing and recrossing, and constantly jostling
both horse and man to provoke a quarrel; others stealing away and
summoning their companions in a low whistle.  Once, even in that short
passage, there was the noise of scuffling and the clash of swords behind
him, but Will, who knew the City and its ways, kept straight on and
scarcely turned his head.

‘He was very well indeed when I came away, Mr. Peggotty.’

‘You are, sir, I perceive, a man of sense and talent,’ said Mr. Pott,
almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration. ‘I am
most happy, sir, to make the acquaintance of such a man.’

THE HUMBLE PETITION OF CHARLES DICKENS, A DISTRESSED FOREIGNER,

Now, among other improvements, I have turned my attention to the
illustrations, meaning to have woodcuts dropped into the text and no
separate plates. I want to know whether you would object to make me a
little sketch for a woodcut--in indian-ink would be quite
sufficient--about the size of the enclosed scrap; the subject, an old
quaint room with antique Elizabethan furniture, and in the
chimney-corner an extraordinary old clock--the clock belonging to Master
Humphrey, in fact, and no figures. This I should drop into the text at
the head of my opening page.

“Magsman,” he says, and he seemed to myself to get wiser as he got
hoarser; “Society, taken in the lump, is all dwarfs.  At the court of St.
James’s, they was all a doing my old business—all a goin three times
round the Cairawan, in the hold court-suits and properties.  Elsewheres,
they was most of ’em ringin their little bells out of make-believes.
Everywheres, the sarser was a goin round.  Magsman, the sarser is the
uniwersal Institution!”

"Oh de-ar no, sir!"

“I wish my little woman would come home!” said Mr. Tetterby, relenting
and repenting, “I only wish my little woman would come home! I ain’t fit
to deal with ’em. They make my head go round, and get the better of me.
Oh, Johnny! Isn’t it enough that your dear mother has provided you with
that sweet sister?” indicating Moloch; “isn’t it enough that you were
seven boys before without a ray of gal, and that your dear mother went
through what she _did_ go through, on purpose that you might all of you
have a little sister, but must you so behave yourself as to make my head
swim?”

‘I tell my money pretty accurately, and generally keep it in my own
custody,’ said Ralph. ‘I look sharply after most men that I deal with,
and most of all I looked sharply after you. You are welcome to all you
have kept from me.’

‘Never mind,’ rejoined Newman, darting violently to and fro. ‘He’s
coming up tonight: I wrote to tell him. He little thinks I know; he
little thinks I care. Cunning scoundrel! he don’t think that. Not
he, not he. Never mind, I’ll thwart him--I, Newman Noggs. Ho, ho, the
rascal!’

‘My friend Mr. Snodgrass has a strong poetic turn,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

All this time, she was in want: languishing away, in dire and pining
want. With the baby in her arms, she wandered here and there in quest of
occupation; and with its thin face lying in her lap, and looking up in
hers, did any work for any wretched sum: a day and night of labor for as
many farthings as there were figures on the dial. If she had quarreled
with it; if she had neglected it; if she had looked upon it with a
moment's hate! if, in the frenzy of an instant, she had struck it! No!
His comfort was, She loved it always.

‘I have found it out.’

‘Whoever you are, you might have known that I came against my will,
ma’am,’ replied Alexander, ‘for I made noise enough when I got in.’

A further delay ensued, but it was not of long duration. The ground
seemed to open at his feet, and a ragged head appeared.

‘Then I lay my hand upon my heart, and take my stand,’ said Pangloss, ‘by
the pork, which was the best of all possible pork.’

‘We don’t shave gentlemen in your line,’ remarked the young proprietor.

“What is the matter? Sit down and take your breath.”

You come into the Down Refreshment Room, at the Junction, making believe
you don’t know me, and I’ll pint you out with my right thumb over my
shoulder which is Our Missis, and which is Miss Whiff; and which is Miss
Piff; and which is Mrs. Sniff.  But you won’t get a chance to see Sniff,
because he disappeared that night.  Whether he perished, tore to pieces,
I cannot say; but his corkscrew alone remains, to bear witness to the
servility of his disposition.

[Sidenote: Mr. R. H. Horne.]

“Ah, to be sure, so he will!” repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.

"Sorrow a know I knows," said the man.

I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought
he could do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his
head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess,
of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall
lifeless on the carpet. But it didn’t hurt him. On the contrary, I
thought he seemed the fresher for it.

It is in the nature of things that such an institution as our English
army should have many bad and troublesome characters in it.  But, this is
a reason for, and not against, its being made as acceptable as possible
to well-disposed men of decent behaviour.  Such men are assuredly not
tempted into the ranks, by the beastly inversion of natural laws, and the
compulsion to live in worse than swinish foulness.  Accordingly, when any
such Circumlocutional embellishments of the soldier’s condition have of
late been brought to notice, we civilians, seated in outer darkness
cheerfully meditating on an Income Tax, have considered the matter as
being our business, and have shown a tendency to declare that we would
rather not have it misregulated, if such declaration may, without
violence to the Church Catechism, be hinted to those who are put in
authority over us.

‘And no clients to come,’ added Lightwood. ‘Not that that’s a selfish
consideration at all personal to ME.’

The sea moderating as the sun came up, though the sky was cloudy and
wild, we spoke the other boat, to know what stores they had, and to
overhaul what we had.  I had a compass in my pocket, a small telescope, a
double-barrelled pistol, a knife, and a fire-box and matches.  Most of my
men had knives, and some had a little tobacco: some, a pipe as well.  We
had a mug among us, and an iron spoon.  As to provisions, there were in
my boat two bags of biscuit, one piece of raw beef, one piece of raw
pork, a bag of coffee, roasted but not ground (thrown in, I imagine, by
mistake, for something else), two small casks of water, and about half-a-
gallon of rum in a keg.  The Surf-boat, having rather more rum than we,
and fewer to drink it, gave us, as I estimated, another quart into our
keg.  In return, we gave them three double handfuls of coffee, tied up in
a piece of a handkerchief; they reported that they had aboard besides, a
bag of biscuit, a piece of beef, a small cask of water, a small box of
lemons, and a Dutch cheese.  It took a long time to make these exchanges,
and they were not made without risk to both parties; the sea running
quite high enough to make our approaching near to one another very
hazardous.  In the bundle with the coffee, I conveyed to John Steadiman
(who had a ship's compass with him), a paper written in pencil, and torn
from my pocket-book, containing the course I meant to steer, in the hope
of making land, or being picked up by some vessel--I say in the hope,
though I had little hope of either deliverance.  I then sang out to him,
so as all might hear, that if we two boats could live or die together, we
would; but, that if we should be parted by the weather, and join company
no more, they should have our prayers and blessings, and we asked for
theirs.  We then gave them three cheers, which they returned, and I saw
the men's heads droop in both boats as they fell to their oars again.

‘R. S.!’ said Kit, after some consideration.  ‘It must be Mr Richard
Swiveller.  Well, its very kind of him, and I thank him heartily.’

Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great
politeness, ‘Really, sir?’

"Well!" said Mr. Weller to himself, as the man approached. "This is
wery odd. I could ha' swore it was him."

Though the host of the Nutmeg-Grater had a lively regard for his
good-wife, it was of the old patronising kind, and she amused him
mightily.  Nothing would have astonished him so much, as to have known
for certain from any third party, that it was she who managed the whole
house, and made him, by her plain straightforward thrift, good-humour,
honesty, and industry, a thriving man.  So easy it is, in any degree of
life (as the world very often finds it), to take those cheerful natures
that never assert their merit, at their own modest valuation; and to
conceive a flippant liking of people for their outward oddities and
eccentricities, whose innate worth, if we would look so far, might make
us blush in the comparison!

‘I have never heard any noises here, worth speaking of.’

"Yes, he is, sir," replied the landlady. "Here, Charley, show the
gentleman in to Mr. Lowten."

I acted on Mrs. Crupp’s opinion, and gave the order at the pastry-cook’s
myself. Walking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard
mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop, which resembled
marble, but was labelled ‘Mock Turtle’, I went in and bought a slab of
it, which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for
fifteen people. This preparation, Mrs. Crupp, after some difficulty,
consented to warm up; and it shrunk so much in a liquid state, that we
found it what Steerforth called ‘rather a tight fit’ for four.

Barbara was the subject of Mr Chuckster’s commendations; and as she was
lingering near the carriage (all being now ready for its departure),
that gentleman was suddenly seized with a strong interest in the
proceedings, which impelled him to swagger down the garden, and take up
his position at a convenient ogling distance.  Having had great
experience of the sex, and being perfectly acquainted with all those
little artifices which find the readiest road to their hearts, Mr
Chuckster, on taking his ground, planted one hand on his hip, and with
the other adjusted his flowing hair.  This is a favourite attitude in
the polite circles, and, accompanied with a graceful whistling, has
been known to do immense execution.

An hour's walking brought the travellers to a little road-side
public-house, with two elm trees, a horse trough, and a sign-post, in
front; one or two deformed hay-ricks behind, a kitchen garden at the
side, and rotten sheds and mouldering out-houses jumbled in strange
confusion all about it. A red-headed man was working in the garden; and
to him Mr. Pickwick called lustily--"Hallo there!"

"No, Sammy," replied Mr. Weller, again looking thoughtfully at the
fire. "I wos in a referee, Sammy."

My box was at my old lodging, over the water, and I had written a
direction for it on the back of one of our address cards that we nailed
on the casks: "Master David, to be left till called for, at the Coach
Office, Dover." This I had in my pocket ready to put on the box, after I
should have got it out of the house; and as I went towards my lodging, I
looked about me for some one who would help me to carry it to the
booking-office.

Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to
test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest
of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped;
put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.

If any dispassionate spectator could have beheld the countenance of the
illustrious man, whose name forms the leading feature of the title of
this work, during the latter part of this conversation, he would have
been almost induced to wonder that the indignant fire which flashed from
his eyes did not melt the glasses of his spectacles--so majestic was his
wrath. His nostrils dilated, and his fists clenched involuntarily, as he
heard himself addressed by the villain. But he restrained himself again-
-he did not pulverise him.

METROPOLITAN MEN OF SCIENCE.

He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible
drowsiness; and further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a
parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed, and had barely time to reel
to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep.

Staunch Papists, Presbyterians,
      And Churchmen great and small;
    With _Mathew_, _Mark_, and _Luke_, and _John_,
      Old _Adam_ and _St. Paul_!

“Why,” continued Catherine, “they say he is nearly dying, and that his
housekeeper, Marguerite, vowed he could never get up stairs alive. It
took two men to carry him up; and when he was at length quiet in bed,
Marguerite went down to the porter’s lodge and sobbed there a whole
hour, saying, ‘Her poor master had the gout, the rheumatics, and a bad
asthma; that though he had been got up stairs, he would never come down
again alive; that if she could only get him to confess his sins and make
his will, she would not mind it so much; but that when she spoke of the
lawyer or the priest, he blasphemed at her like a heathen, and declared
he would live to bury her and everybody else.’”

‘Wet,’ replied the boy. ‘Very wet. I have always said, when it has
rained hard, that it was like the night I came: and they used to crowd
round and laugh to see me cry when the rain fell heavily. It was like a
child, they said, and that made me think of it more. I turned cold all
over sometimes, for I could see myself as I was then, coming in at the
very same door.’

“No, no,” said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might
be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his
absence. “Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me
tonight. No, say tomorrow. As he is not here, tomorrow will be time
enough.”

“Quite so, sir!”

[Illustration: text decoration]

The idea of Tom and his sister blustering, under any circumstances, was
a splendid absurdity. But Tom was very far from feeling it to be so,
in his excitement; and passed out at the gate with such severe
determination written in his face that the porter hardly knew him again.

Martin Chuzzlewit beheld these roystering preparations with infinite
contempt, and stirring the fire into a blaze (to the great destruction
of Mr Pecksniff’s coals), sat moodily down before it, in the most
comfortable chair he could find. That he might the better squeeze
himself into the small corner that was left for him, Mr Pinch took up
his position on Miss Mercy Pecksniff’s stool, and setting his glass down
upon the hearthrug and putting his plate upon his knees, began to enjoy
himself.

MY DEAR GEORGE,

"Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?" inquired the man with the
keys.

But now the Bird of Paradise was seen to flutter down the middle; and
the little bells began to bounce and jingle in poussette; and the
Doctor's rosy face spun round and round, like an expressive pegtop
highly varnished; and breathless Mr. Craggs began to doubt already,
whether country dancing had been made "too easy," like the rest of life;
and Mr. Snitchey, with his nimble cuts and capers, footed it for Self,
and Craggs, and half a dozen more.

"There's the officer," exclaimed Mr. Winkle, after a few minutes'
walking.

"Oh, you are in low spirits, Mr. Micawber," said Traddles.

"She's bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar," replied Barney.

Dick, stung by the laughter, and feeling keenly the ridiculous position
in which he was placed, made a rush at Andy, who, seeing the storm
brewing, gradually sneaked away from the group, and, when he perceived
the sudden movement of Dick the Devil, took to his heels, with Dick
after him.

‘I have been foiled, and that has piqued me,’ replied Villiers.

Full twenty times, the rioters, headed by one man who wielded an axe
in his right hand, and bestrode a brewer’s horse of great size and
strength, caparisoned with fetters taken out of Newgate, which clanked
and jingled as he went, made an attempt to force a passage at this
point, and fire the vintner’s house. Full twenty times they were
repulsed with loss of life, and still came back again; and though
the fellow at their head was marked and singled out by all, and was a
conspicuous object as the only rioter on horseback, not a man could
hit him. So surely as the smoke cleared away, so surely there was he;
calling hoarsely to his companions, brandishing his axe above his head,
and dashing on as though he bore a charmed life, and was proof against
ball and powder.

“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver.

In the Press, in 3 vols.,

They had no children, though they had been married for some years; but
at last there came the hope of an heir, and the Queen's delight was
unbounded--nor was the King's joy less than hers.

"I wonder if we ought to call first upon the Wittingtons, or wait until
they call upon us?" said Mrs. Cannon, after dinner.

“I will give fifty pounds,” cried an old gentleman from the same
quarter, “to the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he
come to ask me for it.”

There was another; not quite so bad at first, but still a trying shop;
where children’s books were sold, and where poor Robinson Crusoe
stood alone in his might, with dog and hatchet, goat-skin cap and
fowling-pieces; calmly surveying Philip Quarn and the host of imitators
round him, and calling Mr Pinch to witness that he, of all the crowd,
impressed one solitary footprint on the shore of boyish memory, whereof
the tread of generations should not stir the lightest grain of sand.
And there too were the Persian tales, with flying chests and students of
enchanted books shut up for years in caverns; and there too was Abudah,
the merchant, with the terrible little old woman hobbling out of the box
in his bedroom; and there the mighty talisman, the rare Arabian Nights,
with Cassim Baba, divided by four, like the ghost of a dreadful sum,
hanging up, all gory, in the robbers’ cave. Which matchless wonders,
coming fast on Mr Pinch’s mind, did so rub up and chafe that wonderful
lamp within him, that when he turned his face towards the busy street,
a crowd of phantoms waited on his pleasure, and he lived again, with new
delight, the happy days before the Pecksniff era.

The old man suspended a piece of ham, that he had impaled on a fork,
midway between his mouth and plate; and, planting his right hand on his
thigh, he looked earnestly at the girl.

Regardless of all this—for she had weightier matters at heart—Nancy
followed the man with trembling limbs to a small antechamber, lighted
by a lamp from the ceiling, in which he left her, and retired.

Presently he drew his shoulders together with a slight determined
jerk, threw himself back upon the grass, and turning to me, with
that tremulous, haggard smile upon his lips which I knew so well,
but which had never before struck me with such infinite pathos,
"Luckily," he said, "there are other things to do in life besides
being happy.  Only perhaps you understand now what I meant last
night when I spoke of things which flesh and blood cannot bear, and
yet which must be borne."

So said John Browdie, rubbing his hands with great joyousness, and
looking round him with a ruddy shining face, quite in keeping with the
declaration.

The lamps, gleaming on the medley of horses’ heads, jumbled with the
shadowy driver, and the fluttering of his cloak, made a thousand
indistinct shapes, answering to his thoughts. Shadows of familiar
people, stooping at their desks and books, in their remembered
attitudes; strange apparitions of the man whom he was flying from, or
of Edith; repetitions in the ringing bells and rolling wheels, of words
that had been spoken; confusions of time and place, making last night a
month ago, a month ago last night—home now distant beyond hope, now
instantly accessible; commotion, discord, hurry, darkness, and
confusion in his mind, and all around him.—Hallo! Hi! away at a gallop
over the black landscape; dust and dirt flying like spray, the smoking
horses snorting and plunging as if each of them were ridden by a demon,
away in a frantic triumph on the dark road—whither?

This pantomime was founded upon the story of Whittington and his
Cat, and had a very extended run. On the night of its production, his
spirits were so affected by the calamity he had sustained, that it was
with great difficulty he could go through his part, in which he had
very nearly failed. He succeeded by a strong effort in finishing the
piece; and although his health paid very dearly for this and other
efforts of the same nature, the constant bustle and excitement of his
professional duties aided in recovering him, and enabling him to act
with his accustomed vivacity.

‘Well!’ said the doctor, ‘we must keep him quiet; keep the room cool;
give him his draughts regularly; and see that he’s carefully looked to.
That’s all!’

Mrs. Turner's share in the death of Overbury was amply proved; and Coke
pronounced sentence upon her, telling her that she had been guilty of
the seven deadly sins, among which he enumerated witchcraft and popery.
"Upon the Wednesday following," says the account of the trial, "she was
brought from the sheriff's in a coach to Newgate, and was there put
into a cart; and, _casting money often among the people as she went_,
she was carried to Tyburn, where she was executed, and whither many
men and women of fashion came in coaches to see her die; to whom she
made a speech, desiring them not to rejoice at her fall, but to take
example by her. She exhorted them to serve God, and abandon pride and
all other sins; related her breeding with the Countess of Somerset,
having had no other means to maintain her and her children but what
came from the countess; and said further, that, when her hand was once
in the business, she knew the revealing it would be her overthrow. The
which, with other like speeches, and great penitency there showed,
moved the spectators to great pity and grief for her."

"You need not fear me," said Nicholas, kindly.  "Are you cold?"

‘What would you have?’ said Hugh. ‘Fevers are never at their height at
once. They must get on by degrees.’

"The noise of the combat was terrific; each of the three combatants
swearing like troopers, and their swords clashing with as much noise
as if all the knives and steels in Newport market were rattling
together, at the same time. When it was at its very height, the lady
(to encourage my uncle most probably) withdrew her hood entirely from
her face, and disclosed a countenance of such dazzling beauty, that
he would have fought against fifty men, to win one smile from it, and
die. He had done wonders before, but now he began to powder away like a
raving mad giant.

‘The term you use,’ said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, ‘is a reproach to
those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It
reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that
pass. He was born in this town.’

This was the crushing blow given to the southern insurrection. All
was lost, for baggage, arms, provisions, and ammunition were totally
abandoned. A few soldiers and Protestants who had fallen into their
hands and escaped assassination were mercifully they suffered a
continued loss, and at last had become so totally delivered and the
insurgents disbanded, and while the Wexford party crossed into their
native country through the Scullagh gap, the wanderers from Wicklow
and Kildare went off dispersedly, some of the least guilty returning to
their own homes, while others, despairing of forgiveness, commenced an
outlaw’s life, and sank the rebel in the robber.

But few raps were heard. F. delivered the messages by writing, his fat,
lumpy hand moving spasmodically over the sheets of paper. From several
of the names written on the pellets came communications, vague and
meaningless, any one of which might have been exchanged for the other
without loss of force.

Mr. Bob Sawyer peeped into the shop to see that no stranger was within
hearing, and leaning forward to Mr. Winkle, said, in a low tone--

"It's wonderful how the poor people patronise me," said Mr. Bob Sawyer,
reflectively. "They knock me up at all hours of the night; they take
medicine to an extent which I should have conceived impossible; they
put on blisters and leeches with a perseverance worthy of a better
cause; they make additions to their families, in a manner which is
quite awful. Six of those last-named little promissory notes, all due
on the same day, Ben, and all entrusted to me!"

"Rum old girl," said Mr. Jingle, as he walked down the passage.

‘I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,’ rejoined Rose; ‘but
indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_
ill, aunt.’

Numbers of the English nobles had been killed in the last disastrous
battle. Their estates, and the estates of all the nobles who had fought
against him there, King William seized upon, and gave to his own Norman
knights and nobles. Many great English families of the present time
acquired their English lands in this way, and are very proud of it.

[_So far in his own writing._]

‘Cut away,’ said Fledgeby. ‘Start with your motive.’

MY DEAR HARRY,

[Sidenote: Mr. John Forster.]

“Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection? Does he
like the trade?”

A few words to Joe as he mounted his horse sufficiently explained what
had passed, and renewed all that young gentleman’s despondency with
tenfold aggravation. They rode back to the Maypole without exchanging a
syllable, and arrived at the door with heavy hearts.

The author of the exploits of _Brown Bess_ and of _The Admirable
Crichton_ has announced his intention of _editing_ "_The Lions of
London_," a task of no ordinary description; and _Boz_ has already
chronicled the slang, humour, peculiarities, and vices of the omnibus
cads and cab-drivers. Pierce Egan, after uttering a vulgar forgery
of _Life in London_, has in a repentant fit announced himself as
"_A Pilgrim of the Thames_;" and, in short, the wonders of this
wondrous metropolis are drawn, depicted, coloured, printed, narrated,
represented, in every possible shape and way to the town and country
public. All this we know: but we know more; we know that there are
_the_ places, _the_ scenes, and _the_ characters to be visited, and
contemplated, and admired in town, which will be omitted to be noticed
by any of our pleasant historians; but which are, of all others, worthy
of sincere regard and periodical immortality! In the East, according to
the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the corner of the Kiosk was
the distinguished place of honour; and may we not conduct our readers to
corners and by-places, and "show their eyes and grieve their hearts?"
We have for some time felt a great anxiety to exhibit to our readers
a few remarkable features of society, or rather to introduce them to
Those who are connected with those features. All know, and yet all do
not intimately and in particular know, many of our great scientific
humanists, as connected with particular departments of our precious
faces or heads; but we long, we thirst, to be the chroniclers of

‘What do you mean?’ said Quilp.

“Stop thief!—stop thief!” The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and
the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through
the mud, and rattling along the pavements; up go the windows, out run
the people, onward bear the mob; a whole audience desert Punch in the
very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the
shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, “Stop thief!—stop thief!”

DEAR SIR,

“No, no,” said the Jew, hastily, as though, however desirous he might
be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his
absence. “Tell him I came here to see him, and that he must come to me
to-night; no, say to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will be time
enough.”

‘Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford?’

“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,
instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of
a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very
serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of
what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may
lead to miserable things.”

‘Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort of
ark?’

‘He’d walk the journey in two days.  If he was footsore and couldn’t
walk, I sent him, in the letter he got, the money to ride, lest he should
have none of his own to spare.’

‘No, don’t send me to bed!’ pleaded Dora, coming to my side. ‘Pray,
don’t do that!’

THE BRITISH LION

My aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their way to
her cheeks. ‘You are quite right,’ she said. ‘It was very thoughtful to
mention it.’

Thank my dear Mrs. Fields for me for her delightful letter received on
the 16th. I will write to her very soon, and tell her about the dogs. I
would write by this post, but that Wills' absence (in Sussex, and
getting no better there as yet) so overwhelms me with business that I
can scarcely get through it.

"Capital, Grimaldi!" he cried, still laughing; "you have won me a
wager--so ought to go snacks in it;" and he slipped five guineas into
his hand.

GENTLEMEN, I feel it very difficult, I assure you, to tender my
acknowledgments to you, and through you, to those many friends of mine
whom you represent, for this honour and distinction which you have
conferred upon me.  I can most honestly assure you, that it is in the
power of no great representative of numbers of people to awaken such
happiness in me as is inspired by this token of goodwill and remembrance,
coming to me direct and fresh from the numbers themselves.  I am truly
sensible, gentlemen, that my friends who have united in this address are
partial in their kindness, and regard what I have done with too great
favour.  But I may say, with reference to one class—some members of
which, I presume, are included there—that I should in my own eyes be very
unworthy both of the generous gift and the generous feeling which has
been evinced, and this occasion, instead of pleasure, would give me
nothing but pain, if I was unable to assure them, and those who are in
front of this assembly, that what the working people have found me
towards them in my books, I am throughout my life.  Gentlemen, whenever I
have tried to hold up to admiration their fortitude, patience,
gentleness, the reasonableness of their nature, so accessible to
persuasion, and their extraordinary goodness one towards another, I have
done so because I have first genuinely felt that admiration myself, and
have been thoroughly imbued with the sentiment which I sought to
communicate to others.

“I never saw him in all my life,” said Mr. Bumble.

‘You do not know what it is,’ she went on addressing him, ‘to be brought
up strictly and straitly. I was so brought up. Mine was no light youth
of sinful gaiety and pleasure. Mine were days of wholesome repression,
punishment, and fear. The corruption of our hearts, the evil of our
ways, the curse that is upon us, the terrors that surround us--these
were the themes of my childhood. They formed my character, and filled me
with an abhorrence of evil-doers. When old Mr Gilbert Clennam proposed
his orphan nephew to my father for my husband, my father impressed upon
me that his bringing-up had been, like mine, one of severe restraint.
He told me, that besides the discipline his spirit had undergone, he
had lived in a starved house, where rioting and gaiety were unknown, and
where every day was a day of toil and trial like the last. He told me
that he had been a man in years long before his uncle had acknowledged
him as one; and that from his school-days to that hour, his uncle’s roof
has been a sanctuary to him from the contagion of the irreligious
and dissolute. When, within a twelvemonth of our marriage, I found
my husband, at that time when my father spoke of him, to have sinned
against the Lord and outraged me by holding a guilty creature in my
place, was I to doubt that it had been appointed to me to make the
discovery, and that it was appointed to me to lay the hand of punishment
upon that creature of perdition? Was I to dismiss in a moment--not my
own wrongs--what was I! but all the rejection of sin, and all the war
against it, in which I had been bred?’

‘We must let him in,’ he said, taking up the candle.

It was a dinner to provoke an appetite, though he had not had one. The
rarest dishes, sumptuously cooked and sumptuously served; the choicest
fruits; the most exquisite wines; marvels of workmanship in gold and
silver, china and glass; innumerable things delicious to the senses of
taste, smell, and sight, were insinuated into its composition. O, what
a wonderful man this Merdle, what a great man, what a master man, how
blessedly and enviably endowed--in one word, what a rich man!

“Once for all, Rosa, will you uncover that ridiculous little head of
yours and give me a welcome?”

“Every word!” cried the old gentleman, “every word that has passed
between you and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the
wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight
of the persecuted child has turned vice itself and given it the courage
and almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you
were morally if not really a party.”

‘I suppose he’d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin,
had he?’ inquired Charley Bates.

Besides, the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that
nobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell’s son and that
she was not to have told. But Mrs. Rouncewell protests, with warmth
enough to swell the stomacher, that of course she would have told Sir
Leicester as soon as he got better.

‘I revere the memory of Mr F. as an estimable man and most indulgent
husband, only necessary to mention Asparagus and it appeared or to hint
at any little delicate thing to drink and it came like magic in a pint
bottle it was not ecstasy but it was comfort, I returned to papa’s roof
and lived secluded if not happy during some years until one day papa
came smoothly blundering in and said that Arthur Clennam awaited me
below, I went below and found him ask me not what I found him except
that he was still unmarried still unchanged!’

This lady lodged at a bird-fancier’s, next door but one to the
celebrated mutton-pie shop, and directly opposite to the original
cat’s-meat warehouse; the renown of which establishments was duly
heralded on their respective fronts. It was a little house, and this was
the more convenient; for Mrs Gamp being, in her highest walk of art,
a monthly nurse, or, as her sign-board boldly had it, ‘Midwife,’ and
lodging in the first-floor front, was easily assailable at night by
pebbles, walking-sticks, and fragments of tobacco-pipe; all much more
efficacious than the street-door knocker, which was so constructed as
to wake the street with ease, and even spread alarms of fire in Holborn,
without making the smallest impression on the premises to which it was
addressed.

‘A disgraceful imposition,’ observed the old lady.

Barnet, to say the truth, appeared to entertain an opposite sentiment
on the subject, and on such occasions frequently expressed himself
audibly, though indefinitely, in reference to “a parcel of girls.” As
it was not easy to ruffle her sweet temper, however, Florence generally
reconciled the young gentleman to his fate after a few minutes, and
they strolled on amicably: Lady Skettles and Sir Barnet following, in a
state of perfect complacency and high gratification.

‘Now, Fagin,’ said Nancy with a laugh. ‘Tell Bill at once, about
Oliver!’

"Lord save us!" exclaimed the old lady, starting; "don't talk in that
way, child. You're weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel
your chair round to the other side, and then you won't see it. There,"
said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; "you don't see it
now, at all events."

No place could have been more appropriately selected for tender
meditation. _There_ was the conscious hedge, that had witnessed the
first kiss of love; ay, and for naught I knew to the contrary, the
identical flower-pot on which her sylphic form had rested; sylphic it
was no longer, for the slender girl had ripened into a stout and comely
gentlewoman; and she would be mine--mine that very evening.

The external diameter of the rotunda was one hundred and eighty-five
feet. It was surrounded on the outside by an arcade similar to that
within, above which ran a gallery with a roof supported by pillars,
and defended by a balustrade. The main entrance was a handsome piece
of architecture, with a wide, round, arched gate in the centre, and a
lesser entrance at either side.

MY DEAR MARY,

_Nicholas Nickleby._

"Very good," said Mr. Omer. "That's right. And so, young gentleman," he
added, after a few moments' further rubbing of his chin, "that you may
not consider me long-winded as well as short-breathed, I believe that's
all about it."

"Edward," replied my mother, timidly, "you are a far better judge of all
questions than I pretend to be. Both you and Jane are. I only said--"

"Funnier!" said Mrs. Jarley in a shrill voice. "It is not funny at all."

‘You will,’ said Rose, after a pause, ‘take some money from me,
which may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until
we meet again?’

"At a boarding-school?" said Sam.

When they had had their laugh out, which did not happen very soon, for
give John an inch that way and he was sure to take several ells, being
a jovial, good-tempered fellow, they looked about them more closely,
groping among the lumber for any stray means of enlightenment that might
turn up. But no scrap or shred of information could they find. The books
were marked with a variety of owner’s names, having, no doubt, been
bought at sales, and collected here and there at different times; but
whether any one of these names belonged to Tom’s employer, and, if so,
which of them, they had no means whatever of determining. It occurred to
John as a very bright thought to make inquiry at the steward’s office,
to whom the chambers belonged, or by whom they were held; but he came
back no wiser than he went, the answer being, ‘Mr Fips, of Austin
Friars.’

I was sure of that, I said, from what I had seen. ‘But,’ I added, ‘may
I ask you a question?’

One final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet. When they
brought him the proposed treaty of peace, in writing, as he lay very
ill in bed, they brought him also the list of the deserters from their
allegiance, whom he was required to pardon. The first name upon this
list was John, his favourite son, in whom he had trusted to the last.

"Answer me one question," said Grimaldi, releasing his hold; "give me a
plain and straightforward answer, for it's only by telling me the truth
now, that you can hope for any leniency at my hands. What was your
motive for taking me into the company of these men and women, and why
did they want to have me among them?"

‘Don’t be alarmed,’ cried Nicholas, running down; ‘here it is; it’s all
out, it’s all over; pray compose yourselves; there’s no harm done;’
and with these, and a thousand other assurances, he delivered the baby
(whom, in his hurry, he had carried upside down), to Mrs. Kenwigs, and
ran back to assist Mr. Kenwigs, who was rubbing his head very hard, and
looking much bewildered by his tumble.

At such a time, the Christmas music he had heard before, began to play.
He listened to it at first, as he had listened in the church-yard; but
presently—it playing still, and being borne towards him on the night air,
in a low, sweet, melancholy strain—he rose, and stood stretching his
hands about him, as if there were some friend approaching within his
reach, on whom his desolate touch might rest, yet do no harm. As he did
this, his face became less fixed and wondering; a gentle trembling came
upon him; and at last his eyes filled with tears, and he put his hands
before them, and bowed down his head.

“I believe not.”

From this time the fate of the Earl of Essex and that of the Queen
seemed to be blended together. The Irish were still perpetually
quarrelling and fighting among themselves, and he went over to Ireland
as Lord Lieutenant, to the great joy of his enemies (Sir Walter Raleigh
among the rest), who were glad to have so dangerous a rival far off.
Not being by any means successful there, and knowing that his enemies
would take advantage of that circumstance to injure him with the Queen,
he came home again, though against her orders. The Queen being taken by
surprise when he appeared before her, gave him her hand to kiss, and he
was overjoyed—though it was not a very lovely hand by this time—but in
the course of the same day she ordered him to confine himself to his
room, and two or three days afterwards had him taken into custody. With
the same sort of caprice—and as capricious an old woman she now was, as
ever wore a crown or a head either—she sent him broth from her own
table on his falling ill from anxiety, and cried about him.

“I don’t need to be told,” returns the trooper, taking his pipe from
his lips for a moment and carrying his eyes back from following the
progress of the cushion to the pipe-bowl which is burning low, “that
he carried on heavily and went to ruin. I have been at his right hand
many a day when he was charging upon ruin full-gallop. I was with him
when he was sick and well, rich and poor. I laid this hand upon him
after he had run through everything and broken down everything
beneath him—when he held a pistol to his head.”

‘It’ll be a very hard thing, Liz, if, when I am trying my best to get up
in the world, you pull me back.’

You will be surprised to hear that I have changed the end of "Great
Expectations" from and after Pip's return to Joe's, and finding his
little likeness there.

Peggotty said nothing for a little while; and I warmed my hands, as
silent as she.

‘Young and handsome.  Yes!’ cried the old woman, quite delighted.  ‘As
bonny as a rose!  And what a happy wife!’

Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good
Saint Dunstan had but nipped the evil spirit's nose with a touch of
such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then
indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant
young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed
by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a
Christmas carol; but at the first sound of

It was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often walking about in
the pattern of the carpet, looking out of the window, listening at the
door for footsteps, and occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps
approached that room.  But, after dinner, when the day turned to
twilight, and the twilight turned to night, and still no communication
was made to him, it began to be as he expressed it, ‘like the Holy Office
and slow torture.’  However, still true to his conviction that
indifference was the genuine high-breeding (the only conviction he had),
he seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a
newspaper.

‘Then you had better get them out at the end of it,’ said Ralph.
‘They can’t do better than go back to the country, ma’am; they are in
everybody’s way here.’

‘My dear, we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune. If I am
reserved to wear a wig, I am at least prepared, externally,’ in allusion
to his baldness, ‘for that distinction. I do not,’ said Mr. Micawber,
‘regret my hair, and I may have been deprived of it for a specific
purpose. I cannot say. It is my intention, my dear Copperfield, to
educate my son for the Church; I will not deny that I should be happy,
on his account, to attain to eminence.’

"May! My dear old friend!" cried Dot, running up to meet her. "What a
happiness to see you!"

He, however, immediately rose again, and producing his staff, was
about, thus strengthened, to renew the combat, when a gentleman who
chanced to be sitting in the room, a stranger to the party, rose, and
drawing from his pocket a silver staff, shook it at Lucas, and said,
"I will have no more of this violence! Let all parties adjourn to the
Police-office; and if Mr. Grimaldi's tale be true, and your purpose be
merely that of endeavouring to extort money, as I have no doubt it is,
I will take care that things be laid properly before the magistrate."

“No, but really;—isn’t it, you know, after all—”

‘Why, see there! I also! Almost as much a stranger here as you, though
born here, I came from Marseilles a little while ago. Don’t be cast
down.’ The face looked up at him imploringly, as he rose from wiping it,
and gently replaced the coat that covered the writhing figure. ‘I won’t
leave you till you shall be well taken care of. Courage! You will be
very much better half an hour hence.’

It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson’s, than to look out of
Tellson’s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the
old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus
into the Doctor’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.

"Just as I was preparing to give my master a hint by one of the
writing-clerks to be on his guard, who should walk into the office but
Snaps himself?

What if the murdered man were there before him!

‘Lift him up,’ said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to rise.

‘“What man wanders among graves and churchyards on such a night as
this?” cried the goblin.

THE court was paved from floor to roof with human faces. Inquisitive
and eager eyes peered from every inch of space; from the rail before
the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the
galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man—the Jew. Before him and
behind, above, below, on the right and on the left—he seemed to stand
surrounded by a firmament all bright with beaming eyes.

‘So odd, too,’ remarked Miss Snevellicci, ‘isn’t he?’

She raised her head as with a sudden attention to the circumstances under
which she was recalling these events, and looked quickly at the stranger.
Seeing that his face was turned toward the window, and that he seemed
intent upon the prospect, she made some eager signs to her husband, and
pointed to the bill, and moved her mouth as if she were repeating with
great energy, one word or phrase to him over and over again.  As she
uttered no sound, and as her dumb motions like most of her gestures were
of a very extraordinary kind, this unintelligible conduct reduced Mr.
Britain to the confines of despair.  He stared at the table, at the
stranger, at the spoons, at his wife—followed her pantomime with looks of
deep amazement and perplexity—asked in the same language, was it property
in danger, was it he in danger, was it she—answered her signals with
other signals expressive of the deepest distress and confusion—followed
the motions of her lips—guessed half aloud ‘milk and water,’ ‘monthly
warning,’ ‘mice and walnuts’—and couldn’t approach her meaning.

I suppose it is clear that the next letter I write is Katie's. Either
from Cork or from Limerick, it shall report further. At Limerick I read
in the theatre, there being no other place.

With these words, Wardle shook Mr. Pickwick's hand once more, and
having done the same by Perker, threw himself into an arm-chair, his
jolly red face shining again with smiles and health.

‘Do you take me for a blind man,’ asked Martin, somewhat impatiently,
‘that you think it necessary to tell me that, when his face is the
blackest that ever was seen?’

"You will convince yourself?" said Jingle.

‘This Hawk will come back, however,’ muttered Ralph; ‘and if I know the
man (and I should by this time) his wrath will have lost nothing of its
violence in the meanwhile. Obliged to live in retirement--the
monotony of a sick-room to a man of his habits--no life--no drink--no
play--nothing that he likes and lives by. He is not likely to forget
his obligations to the cause of all this. Few men would; but he of all
others? No, no!’

But Margrave's keen eye caught sight of the atoms upcast by the
light of the moon.  He exclaimed to me, "Found!  I shall live!"
And then, as he gathered up the grains with tremulous hands, he
called out to the Veiled Woman, hitherto still seated motionless on
the crag.  At his word she rose and went to the place hard by,
where the fuel was piled, busying herself there.  I had no leisure
to heed her.  I continued my search in the soft and yielding soil
that time and the decay of vegetable life had accumulated over the
pre-Adamite strata on which the arch of the cave rested its mighty
keystone.

Holmes, Mr., ii. 306

"I would rather," said the young Captain, "see this in you, Doubledick,
than I would see five thousand guineas counted out upon this table for a
gift to my good mother.  Have you a mother?"

Mrs Varden stood aghast as he took it from her outstretched hand, tore
it into fragments, and threw them under the grate.

AND WHEN THEY SHALL HAVE GROWN OLD AND GRAY,

This refection of oysters was not presided over by Affery, but by the
girl who had appeared when the bell was rung; the same who had been in
the dimly-lighted room last night. Now that he had an opportunity of
observing her, Arthur found that her diminutive figure, small features,
and slight spare dress, gave her the appearance of being much younger
than she was. A woman, probably of not less than two-and-twenty, she
might have been passed in the street for little more than half that
age. Not that her face was very youthful, for in truth there was more
consideration and care in it than naturally belonged to her utmost
years; but she was so little and light, so noiseless and shy, and
appeared so conscious of being out of place among the three hard elders,
that she had all the manner and much of the appearance of a subdued
child.

‘We do, Miss Peecher.’

‘And if any further ground of objection be wanting,’ continued Mr.
Pickwick, ‘you are too fat, sir.’

“I come as I am called,” replied the Ghost.

‘My daughter, sir,’ returned Bray, haughtily, ‘as I have brought her
up, would be a rich recompense for the largest fortune that a man could
bestow in exchange for her hand.’

He leaned his hand on the back of a chair, and looked at them. It was
in vain to try to do so scornfully, or with his usual insolence. He
required the chair for his support. But he made a struggle for it.

‘What HAS come, then?’ inquired Mr. Nickleby.

"I suppose," said Dick, "that they consult together a good deal, and
talk about a great many people--about me, for instance sometimes, eh,
Marchioness?"

Grimaldi, for the benefit of Mr. T. Dibdin, at the Surrey Theatre,
March 26, 1822, played his old part of Squire Bugle, in "Mother
Goose," Ridgway being the Harlequin. On Easter Monday, April 8th,
the melodramatic romance of "Cherry and Fair Star; or, the Children
of Cyprus," was produced at Covent Garden. Fair Star was played by
Miss Foote, now Countess of Harrington; Grimaldi enacted Topac, the
slave of the Greek Captain. This piece for splendour surpassed every
other production at that theatre; the accompaniments were of the first
description, and the looking-glass scene presented a gorgeous effect.

‘I assume this to be the case, then.’

This Boot was a lone house of public entertainment, situated in the
fields at the back of the Foundling Hospital; a very solitary spot at
that period, and quite deserted after dark. The tavern stood at some
distance from any high road, and was approachable only by a dark and
narrow lane; so that Hugh was much surprised to find several people
drinking there, and great merriment going on. He was still more
surprised to find among them almost every face that had caught his
attention in the crowd; but his companion having whispered him outside
the door, that it was not considered good manners at The Boot to appear
at all curious about the company, he kept his own counsel, and made no
show of recognition.

Mr Dombey was resolved to show her that he was supreme. There must be
no will but his. Proud he desired that she should be, but she must be
proud for, not against him. As he sat alone, hardening, he would often
hear her go out and come home, treading the round of London life with
no more heed of his liking or disliking, pleasure or displeasure, than
if he had been her groom. Her cold supreme indifference—his own
unquestioned attribute usurped—stung him more than any other kind of
treatment could have done; and he determined to bend her to his
magnificent and stately will.

Mr. Bazzard, with a frowning smile at the fire, put a hand into his
tangled locks, as if the thorn of anxiety were there; then into his
waistcoat, as if it were there; then into his pockets, as if it were
there. In all these movements he was closely followed by the eyes of
Edwin, as if that young gentleman expected to see the thorn in action.
It was not produced, however, and Mr. Bazzard merely said: “I follow
you, sir, and I thank you.”

Awake, doomed man, while she is near! The time is flitting by; the hour
is coming with an angry tread; its foot is in the house. Awake!

"Grandfather!"

‘Mr. Fish has said that, I believe,’ returned his lady, glancing at the
letter.  ‘But, upon my word, Sir Joseph, I don’t think I can let it go
after all.  It is so very dear.’

‘Oliver,’ cried Fagin, beckoning to him. ‘Here, here! Let me whisper
to you.’

And this was the end of it.  This was the end of all that made life life
to me.  I buried him there, in hearing of the wash of a strange sea on a
strange shore.  I stayed by the grave till the priest and the bystanders
were gone.  I saw the earth filled in to the last sod, and the
gravedigger stamp it down with his feet.  Then, and not till then, I felt
that I had lost him for ever—the friend I had loved, and hated, and
slain.  Then, and not till then, I knew that all rest, and joy, and hope
were over for me.  From that moment my heart hardened within me, and my
life was filled with loathing.  Day and night, land and sea, labour and
rest, food and sleep, were alike hateful to me.  It was the curse of
Cain, and that my brother had pardoned me made it lie none the lighter.
Peace on earth was for me no more, and goodwill towards men was dead in
my heart for ever.  Remorse softens some natures; but it poisoned mine.
I hated all mankind; but above all mankind I hated the woman who had come
between us two, and ruined both our lives.

"Dear Christopher, it should be gratifying to you to know that you are an
instrument in the hands of Destiny.  Because you _are_."

Here is a very serious business on the great estate respecting the water
supply. Last night, they had pumped the well dry merely in raising the
family supply for the day; and this morning (very little water having
been got into the cisterns) it is dry again! It is pretty clear to me
that we must look the thing in the face, and at once bore deeper, dig,
or do some beastly thing or other, to secure this necessary in
abundance. Meanwhile I am in a most plaintive and forlorn condition
without your presence and counsel. I raise my voice in the wilderness
and implore the same!!!

‘Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?’ I asked.

‘They! Poor creatures,’ murmured the Secretary.

OLIVER’S ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain
and delay attendant upon a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and
cold had brought on fever and ague, which hung about him for many
weeks, and reduced him sadly. But at length he began, by slow degrees,
to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words,
how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how
ardently he hoped that, when he grew strong and well again, he could
do something to shew his gratitude; only something which would let
them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something,
however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness
had not been cast away, but that the poor boy whom their charity had
rescued from misery, or death, was eager and anxious to serve them with
all his heart and soul.

‘Yes!’ replied the immovable Mr. Micawber.

So lovers were invited, and lovers came and were made welcome by the
dozen. Lovers of every description--rich and poor, old and young,
handsome and ugly--so long as they were of passable birth and fair
character, King Brave-Heart was not too particular--in the forlorn hope
that among them one fortunate wight might rouse some sentiment in the
lovely statue he desired to win. But all in vain. Each prince, or duke,
or simple knight, duly instructed in the sad case, did his best: one
would try poetry, another his lute, a third sighs and appeals, a fourth,
imagining he had made some way, would attempt the bold stroke of telling
Ice-Heart that unless she could respond to his adoration he would drown
himself. She only smiled, and begged him to allow her to witness the
performance--she had never seen anyone drown. So, one by one, the troupe
of aspirants--some in disgust, some in strange fear, some in
annoyance--took their departure, preferring a more ordinary spouse than
the bewitched though beautiful Princess.

“The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.

To walk on to the Bank, lamenting the good old times and bemoaning the
present evil period, would be an easy next step, so I would take it, and
would make my houseless circuit of the Bank, and give a thought to the
treasure within; likewise to the guard of soldiers passing the night
there, and nodding over the fire.  Next, I went to Billingsgate, in some
hope of market-people, but it proving as yet too early, crossed
London-bridge and got down by the water-side on the Surrey shore among
the buildings of the great brewery.  There was plenty going on at the
brewery; and the reek, and the smell of grains, and the rattling of the
plump dray horses at their mangers, were capital company.  Quite
refreshed by having mingled with this good society, I made a new start
with a new heart, setting the old King’s Bench prison before me for my
next object, and resolving, when I should come to the wall, to think of
poor Horace Kinch, and the Dry Rot in men.

‘Well,’ said Mr Pancks, ‘and neither will you find in Grubbers like
myself, under Proprietors like this, pleasant qualities. I’ve been a
Grubber from a boy. What has my life been? Fag and grind, fag and grind,
turn the wheel, turn the wheel! I haven’t been agreeable to myself,
and I haven’t been likely to be agreeable to anybody else. If I was a
shilling a week less useful in ten years’ time, this impostor would give
me a shilling a week less; if as useful a man could be got at sixpence
cheaper, he would be taken in my place at sixpence cheaper. Bargain and
sale, bless you! Fixed principles! It’s a mighty fine sign-post, is The
Casby’s Head,’ said Mr Pancks, surveying it with anything rather than
admiration; ‘but the real name of the House is the Sham’s Arms. Its
motto is, Keep the Grubber always at it. Is any gentleman present,’ said
Mr Pancks, breaking off and looking round, ‘acquainted with the English
Grammar?’

‘Why are you sitting here?’ said one of them, who was dressed in a plain
suit of black, wore long lank hair, and carried a great cane. ‘Why have
you not gone with the rest?’

‘Of course you see that she really suffers, when Mr Boffin shows how he
is changing?’

Punctually at the appointed hour next morning, the good-humoured
little attorney tapped at Mr. Pickwick's door, which was opened with
great alacrity by Sam Weller.

Nicholas had his roast lamb, as you said he was to, but he could not
eat it all, and says if you do not mind his doing so he should like to
have the rest hashed to-morrow with some greens, which he is very fond
of, and so am I. He said he did not like to have his porter hot, for he
thought it spoilt the flavour, so I let him have it cold. You should
have seen him drink it. I thought he never would have left off. I also
gave him three pounds of money, all in sixpences, to make it seem more,
and he said directly that he should give more than half to his mamma and
sister, and divide the rest with poor Smike. And I say he is a good
fellow for saying so; and if anybody says he isn't I am ready to fight
him whenever they like--there!

"Dot!" cried the Carrier. "Mary! Darling! What's the matter?"

Wylie’s story is soon told. Stein had persuaded him to give his
creditors the slip and make for California, promising to join him
shortly, and that they would speedily make their fortunes. Wylie was a
man easily led, and consented. He was concealed under a trap-door in
the cigar-shop, and escaped while Fordyce and I sought the police.

"Why, yes," I said, "I must see Peggotty first of all."

‘Bleeding Heart?’

As the astronomers tell us that it is probable that there are in the
universe innumerable solar systems besides ours, to each of which myriads
of utterly unknown and unseen stars belong, so it is certain that every
man, however obscure, however far removed from the general recognition,
is one of a group of men impressible for good, and impressible for evil,
and that it is in the eternal nature of things that he cannot really
improve himself without in some degree improving other men.  And observe,
this is especially the case when he has improved himself in the teeth of
adverse circumstances, as in a maturity succeeding to a neglected or an
ill-taught youth, in the few daily hours remaining to him after ten or
twelve hours’ labour, in the few pauses and intervals of a life of toil;
for then his fellows and companions have assurance that he can have known
no favouring conditions, and that they can do what he has done, in
wresting some enlightenment and self-respect from what Lord Lytton finely
calls—

‘Will you have the kindness to step up-stairs for a moment?’

However, there was no time to think more about the matter, for the
fiddles and harp began in real earnest. Away went Mr. Pickwick—hands
across, down the middle to the very end of the room, and half way up the
chimney, back again to the door—poussette everywhere—loud stamp on the
ground—ready for the next couple—off again—all the figure over once
more—another stamp to beat out the time—next couple, and the next, and
the next again—never was such going; and at last, after they had reached
the bottom of the dance, and full fourteen couple after the old lady had
retired in an exhausted state, and the clergyman’s wife had been
substituted in her stead, did that gentleman, when there was no demand
whatever on his exertions, keep perpetually dancing in his place, to
keep time to the music, smiling on his partner all the while with a
blandness of demeanour which baffles all description.

And so he was. One night, about a fortnight after my return to town from
Paris, where I was told he had been seen, and where I had sought him in
vain, I was proceeding home, baffled in my endeavours to discover him in
some of his old haunts, which I had ascertained after many and fruitless
inquiries. I was walking rapidly down a miserable street in the vicinity
of Clare Market, when a squalid wretch, issuing from a public-house,
came in contact with me. I think no human being in the world would have
recognised him but myself. Hideously changed as he was, I knew him
instantly. The half-shriek that burst from him as he recoiled from me
showed that he had recognised me also. The struggle was a short one,--I
had omitted to put my pistols in my pocket on that evening. With what a
savage triumph, when I had dashed him on the pavement, did I stamp upon
the prostrate carcass of the groaning wretch! But my joy was brief; for
I was suddenly seized by three or four men, who held me firmly by the
arms. I could not get at him. Heedless of my ravings, they assisted the
miscreant to rise, who, casting one glance of terror towards me, darted
down an alley, and was lost to me for ever. He had escaped me.

‘I am much obliged to you, sir,’ returned Mr. Littimer. ‘Perfectly so.’

“Mrs Pipchin, my dear Paul,” returned his sister, “is an elderly
lady—Miss Tox knows her whole history—who has for some time devoted all
the energies of her mind, with the greatest success, to the study and
treatment of infancy, and who has been extremely well connected. Her
husband broke his heart in—how did you say her husband broke his heart,
my dear? I forget the precise circumstances.

‘Because you know it well.’

_Mr. B._ Many can't go there; and many would rather die.

‘We could show her the substance of one, I think?’ said Steerforth,
addressing his eyes to mine. ‘Eh, Daisy?’

‘Come down,’ said Ralph, beckoning him.

“What do you know?” demanded Carker, throwing her a shilling. “Do you
know who the handsome lady is?”

In the strength of his misfortune, and the energy of his distress, he
fired for the moment like a proud man.  In another moment, he stood as he
had stood all the time—his usual stoop upon him; his pondering face
addressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half shrewd,
half perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very
difficult; his hat held tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip;
his right arm, with a rugged propriety and force of action, very
earnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it always paused, a
little bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused.

‘Such a number of nights,’ said the girl, with a touch of woman’s
tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone,
even to her voice: ‘such a number of nights as I’ve been patient
with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child:
and this the first that I’ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn’t
have served me as you did just now, if you’d thought of that, would
you? Come, come; say you wouldn’t.’

‘Yes.  Coming very fast.’

‘Dear me, sir,’ exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.

"Stumpy and Deacon," said the new comer.

They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted
meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were
elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at
length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald
his departure. Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching
footstep. They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr.
Losberne entered.

‘Suppose I haven’t got it,’ he interrupted.

"He became restless and agitated. Without seeming to notice his manner,
I went on.

This martyrdom over, Nicholas arranged with Newman that while he was
otherwise occupied next morning, arrangements should be made for his
mother’s immediately quitting her present residence, and also for
dispatching Miss La Creevy to break the intelligence to her. He then
wrapped himself in Smike’s greatcoat, and repaired to the inn where they
were to pass the night, and where (after writing a few lines to Ralph,
the delivery of which was to be intrusted to Newman next day), he
endeavoured to obtain the repose of which he stood so much in need.

"Only three days--all over then--no more difficulties."

‘Tush, man!’ said Joe, ‘I’m not so young as that. Needs must when the
devil drives; and the devil that drives me is an empty pocket and an
unhappy home. For the present, good-bye.’

"What's the matter?" was the general inquiry.

‘Where,’ said Mr. Tupman, with an effort--‘where is--_she_, Sir?’ and he
turned away his head, and covered his eyes with his hand.

This facetious probability was so congenial to the dwarf’s humour, and
so exquisitely amusing to him, that he laughed as he went along until
the tears ran down his cheeks; and more than once, when he found
himself in a bye-street, vented his delight in a shrill scream, which
greatly terrifying any lonely passenger, who happened to be walking on
before him expecting nothing so little, increased his mirth, and made
him remarkably cheerful and light-hearted.

I make mention of the race, as of the Yorkshire schoolmasters, in the
past tense. Though it has not yet finally disappeared, it is dwindling
daily. A long day’s work remains to be done about us in the way of
education, Heaven knows; but great improvements and facilities towards
the attainment of a good one, have been furnished, of late years.

Rightly interpreting this as the signal for their departure, Martin
walked downstairs after the war correspondent, who preceded him with
great majesty. The colonel following, they left the Rowdy Journal Office
and walked forth into the streets; Martin feeling doubtful whether
he ought to kick the colonel for having presumed to speak to him,
or whether it came within the bounds of possibility that he and his
establishment could be among the boasted usages of that regenerated
land.

The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing
that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their
talk.

"ARABIAN DAYS AND NIGHTS."

Presently, he returned, followed by the boy from the public-house, who
bore in one hand a plate of bread and beef, and in the other a great
pot, filled with some very fragrant compound, which sent forth a
grateful steam, and was indeed choice purl, made after a particular
recipe which Mr Swiveller had imparted to the landlord, at a period
when he was deep in his books and desirous to conciliate his
friendship.  Relieving the boy of his burden at the door, and charging
his little companion to fasten it to prevent surprise, Mr Swiveller
followed her into the kitchen.

‘A gentleman who is a friend of mine, or at least who is not exactly a
friend so much as a sort of acquaintance--Oh upon my word, I hardly
know what I say, Mr Pinch; you mustn’t suppose there is any engagement
between us; or at least if there is, that it is at all a settled thing
as yet--is going to Furnival’s Inn immediately, I believe upon a little
business, and I am sure he would be very glad to accompany you, so as
to prevent your going wrong again. You had better walk in. You will very
likely find my sister Merry here,’ she said with a curious toss of her
head, and anything but an agreeable smile.

The Heroes, by Charles Kingsley.

And a calm would fall upon me,
Worn perhaps with work and pain,
The wild hungry longing left me,
And I was myself again:
Looking at the silver waters,
Looking up at the far sky,
Dreams of home and all I left there
Floated sorrowfully by.

The “Hundredth,” being “Light Infantry,” called itself “a crack
regiment:” the military adjective signifying, in this instance, not so
much a higher reputation for discipline and warlike achievements, as an
indefinite sort of superiority arising from the fact that no man was
allowed to enter the _corps_ who depended on his pay only for the figure
he cut in it. Lieutenant-Colonel Tulip, who commanded, was very strict
in this particular, and, having the good of the service greatly at
heart, set his face entirely against the admission of any young man who
did not enjoy a handsome paternal allowance, or was not the possessor of
a good income. He was himself the son of a celebrated army clothier, and
in the course of ten years, had purchased the rank he now held, so that
he had a right, as he thought, to see that his regiment was not
contaminated by contact with poor men. His military creed was, that no
man had any business in the army who could not afford to keep his horses
or tilbury, and drink wine every day; _that_ he called respectable,
anything short of it the reverse. If he ever relaxed from the severity
of this rule, it was only in favor of those who had high connections; “a
handle to a name” being as reverently worshipped by him as money itself;
indeed, in secret, he preferred a lord’s son, though poor, to a
commoner, however rich; the poverty of a sprig of nobility not being
taken exactly in a literal sense. Colonel Tulip had another theory also:
during the aforesaid ten years, he had acquired some knowledge of drill,
and possessing an hereditary taste for dress, considered himself, thus
endowed, a first-rate officer, though what he would have done with his
regiment in the field is quite another matter. In the meantime he was
gratified by thinking that he did his best to make it a crack corps,
according to his notion of the thing, and such minor points as the
moral training of the officers, and their proficiency in something more
than the forms of the parade ground, were not allowed to enter into his
consideration. The “Hundredth” were acknowledged to be “a devilish
well-dressed, gentlemanly set of fellows,” and were looked after with
great interest at country-balls, races, and regattas; and if this were
not what a regiment ought to be, Colonel Tulip was, he flattered
himself, very much out in his calculations.

‘The Bow Street officers, sir,’ replied Brittles, taking up a
candle; ‘me and Mr. Giles sent for ‘em this morning.’

“Not true. Lies!”

The time flew.  But I observed—listen to this, I pray! (and here the
courier dropped his voice)—I observed my mistress sometimes brooding in a
manner very strange; in a frightened manner; in an unhappy manner; with a
cloudy, uncertain alarm upon her.  I think that I began to notice this
when I was walking up hills by the carriage side, and master had gone on
in front.  At any rate, I remember that it impressed itself upon my mind
one evening in the South of France, when she called to me to call master
back; and when he came back, and walked for a long way, talking
encouragingly and affectionately to her, with his hand upon the open
window, and hers in it.  Now and then, he laughed in a merry way, as if
he were bantering her out of something.  By-and-by, she laughed, and then
all went well again.

But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept
into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be
lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the
tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep
bell to soothe him in his sleep.

Says Podsnap, something sternly, ‘Now, first of all, Veneering, do you
ask my advice?’

‘Oh, ah! I know that,’ replied the coachman gruffly, as he banged the
door.

"This matter is growing alarming," reasoned Mr. Pickwick with himself.
"I can't allow things to go on in this way. By the self-possession
of that lady it is clear to me that I must have come into the wrong
room. If I call out she'll alarm the house; but if I remain here the
consequences will be still more frightful."

As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry
immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence.

Yes, he was there; and pausing
Just near the open’d door,
To check her heart’s quick beating,
She heard—and paused still more—

His pleading—Yes, she knew
The tone—the words—the accents:
She once had heard them too.

The road from Chamounix here takes so much more time than I supposed
(for I travelled it day and night, and my companions don't at all
understand the idea of never going to bed) that we only reached Milan
last night, though we had been travelling twelve and fifteen hours a
day. We crossed the Simplon on Sunday, when there was not (as there is
not now) a particle of cloud in the whole sky, and when the pass was as
nobly grand and beautiful as it possibly can be. There was a good deal
of snow upon the top, but not across the road, which had been cleared.
We crossed the Austrian frontier yesterday, and, both there and at the
gate of Milan, received all possible consideration and politeness.

“What is your real name?” I asked him in a whisper.

"Should you?" said Miss Dartle. "Dear me! Conscientious, is he? Really
conscientious, now?"

"Dear me, no," replied the M.C. "A mail cart! What an excellent idea.
Re--markable!"

So far, however, from rushing upon somebody who offered no resistance
and implored his mercy, Mr Quilp was no sooner in the arms of the
individual whom he had taken for his wife than he found himself
complimented with two staggering blows on the head, and two more, of
the same quality, in the chest; and closing with his assailant, such a
shower of buffets rained down upon his person as sufficed to convince
him that he was in skilful and experienced hands.  Nothing daunted by
this reception, he clung tight to his opponent, and bit and hammered
away with such good-will and heartiness, that it was at least a couple
of minutes before he was dislodged.  Then, and not until then, Daniel
Quilp found himself, all flushed and dishevelled, in the middle of the
street, with Mr Richard Swiveller performing a kind of dance round him
and requiring to know ‘whether he wanted any more?’

"What's that, sir?" inquired poor Oliver.

‘Rum creeters is women,’ said the dirty-faced man, after a pause.

"Oh, but I don't like it!" urged the shrinking child; "it's dreadful."

The children arrived on Tuesday night, by London boat, in every stage
and aspect of sea-sickness.

“Magsman! The most material difference between the two states of
existence through which your unappy friend has passed,”--he reached out
his poor little hand, and his tears dropped down on the mustache which
it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow, but it is not in
mortals to command success,--“the difference is this: When I was out of
society, I was paid light for being seen. When I went into society, I
paid heavy for being seen. I prefer the former, even if I wasn’t forced
upon it. Give me out through the trumpet, in the hold way, to-morrow.”

“I beg your pardon, Sir,” faltered Polly, “but we go out quite plenty
Sir, thank you.”

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends
of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no
greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of
boys, twenty times, in honor of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran
home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at
blindman's-buff.

We are rehearsing at the Haymarket now, and Lemon mentioned to me
yesterday that Webster had asked him if he would sound Forster or me as
to your intention of having a farewell benefit before going to America,
and whether you would like to have it at the Haymarket, and also as to
its being preceded by a short engagement there. I don't know what your
feelings may be on this latter head, but thinking it well that you may
know how the land lies in these seas, send you this; the rather (excuse
Elizabethan phrase, but you know how indispensable it is to me under
existing circumstances)--the rather that I am thereto encouraged by thy
consort, who has just come a-visiting here, with thy fair daughters,
Mistress Nina and the little Kate. Wherefore, most selected friend,
perpend at thy leisure, and so God speed thee!

Lion, a chained, i. 144

There was a dance in the evening. With which general mention of that
recreation, I should have left it alone, if I had not some reason to
suppose that it was quite an original dance, and one of a most uncommon
figure. It was formed in an odd way; in this way.

‘Sing the Refrain, pig! You could sing it once, in another jail. Sing
it! Or, by every Saint who was stoned to death, I’ll be affronted and
compromising; and then some people who are not dead yet, had better have
been stoned along with them!’

Cooke, General, 18.

"I should like to hear," he replied, as he filled his glass again, and
raised it to his lips.

I beg you to accept my cordial thanks for your curious "Visits to
Rochester." As I peeped about its old corners with interest and wonder
when I was a very little child, few people can find a greater charm in
that ancient city than I do.

“Then she is as honest and genuine as she looks,” rejoined my
guardian, “and it is impossible to say more for her.”

The dinner was as hearty an affair as the breakfast, and was quite as
noisy, without the tears. Then came the dessert and some more toasts.
Then came the tea and coffee; and then, the ball.

Clennam’s surprise was not so absorbing but that he took his resolution
without any incertitude. He went up to the door too, and ascended the
steps too. His friend looked at him with a braggart air, and sang to
himself.

To this old man crossing the court-yard, he preferred his inquiry,
touching him on the shoulder. The old man stopped and looked round, with
the expression in his weak grey eyes of one whose thoughts had been far
off, and who was a little dull of hearing also.

‘Here you are,’ said Arthur, determined to be beforehand with the
stranger, whoever he might be.  ‘I’ll take the bed.’  And he handed the
five shillings to the landlord, who nodded, dropped the money carelessly
into his waistcoat-pocket, and lighted the candle.

[[[THE MISER DISCOVERING THE LOSS OF THE MORTGAGE MONEY]]]

‘More than one-and-twenty!’ ejaculated Wardle contemptuously. ‘More than
one-and-forty!’

‘Very extraordinary,’ said Mr. Pickwick, going back into his room, and
seating himself at the table in a musing attitude. ‘What can that young
man be going to do?’

"Gracious!" exclaimed the Princess, "I hope he is not a molly-coddle;"
but before there was time to say more the curtains of the litter were
drawn aside, and in another moment an attendant had lifted out its
occupant, who forthwith proceeded to ascend the steps.

"Nor more you have, old codger," replied the son. "How's mother-in-law?"

"Are you deaf, mynheer?"

‘Well,’ continued his progenitor, looking round him very cautiously,
‘you and I’ll go, punctiwal to the time. The deputy-shepherd won’t,
Sammy; the deputy-shepherd won’t.’ Here Mr. Weller was seized with a
paroxysm of chuckles, which gradually terminated in as near an approach
to a choke as an elderly gentleman can, with safety, sustain.

“He has never hurt anybody but himself,” says Mr. George, smiling.

[31]148, KING'S ROAD, BRIGHTON, _26th May, 1847._

“Oh no, no,” returned Oliver quickly; “but the eyes look so sorrowful;
and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart beat,”
added Oliver in a low voice, “as if it was alive, and wanted to speak
to me, but couldn’t.”

‘Were you looking for me,’ he said, ‘when you peered in at the
window?’

‘Thank’ee, Venus!’ said Mr Boffin, with a hearty grip of his hand;
‘thank’ee, Venus, thank’ee, Venus!’ And then walked up and down the
little shop in great agitation. ‘But look here, Venus,’ he by-and-by
resumed, nervously sitting down again; ‘if I have to buy Wegg up, I
shan’t buy him any cheaper for your being out of it. Instead of his
having half the money—it was to have been half, I suppose? Share and
share alike?’

He turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered
passage. When he comes back, he has recovered his composure, except
that he contends against an avoidance of the boy, which is so very
remarkable that it absorbs the woman’s attention.

"Don't blush, Mr. Grimaldi, pray don't blush; there is not the least
occasion for blushing," said Sir James Scarlett.

‘Now came the difficulties of our position. I am proud. I say nothing
in defence of pride, but I am proud. It is also my character to govern.
I can’t submit; I must govern. Unfortunately, the property of Madame
Rigaud was settled upon herself. Such was the insane act of her late
husband. More unfortunately still, she had relations. When a wife’s
relations interpose against a husband who is a gentleman, who is proud,
and who must govern, the consequences are inimical to peace. There
was yet another source of difference between us. Madame Rigaud was
unfortunately a little vulgar. I sought to improve her manners and
ameliorate her general tone; she (supported in this likewise by her
relations) resented my endeavours. Quarrels began to arise between us;
and, propagated and exaggerated by the slanders of the relations of
Madame Rigaud, to become notorious to the neighbours. It has been said
that I treated Madame Rigaud with cruelty. I may have been seen to slap
her face--nothing more. I have a light hand; and if I have been seen
apparently to correct Madame Rigaud in that manner, I have done it
almost playfully.’

The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and
Stephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.  On the fourth
day, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to
have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with
his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road,
sixty miles away.  Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town
looked for Stephen to be brought in next day.

‘I have suffered. Probably I know how much I have suffered better than
any one--ha--I say than any one! If _I_ can put that aside, if _I_ can
eradicate the marks of what I have endured, and can emerge before the
world--a--ha--gentleman unspoiled, unspotted--is it a great deal to
expect--I say again, is it a great deal to expect--that my children
should--hum--do the same and sweep that accursed experience off the face
of the earth?’

"Divil sweep you!--Soda-wather you mane. You'll get it under the
sideboard."

‘His gills’ll look rummer when he wakes; won’t they?’ says Bob.

A calmer or more beautiful scene could not be imagined. Randulph’s
reflections were interrupted by the approach of two persons from the
left of the fields, who proved to be Sir Norfolk Salusbury and Cardwell
Firebras. Sir Norfolk bowed stiffly to Randulph, and also to Trussell,
and seeing that the beau was not arrived, said to the former, ‘As I am
first in the field, I am entitled to the first bout.’

Bright the carriage looked, sleek the horses looked, gleaming the
harness looked, luscious and lasting the liveries looked. A rich,
responsible turn-out. An equipage for a Merdle. Early people looked
after it as it rattled along the streets, and said, with awe in their
breath, ‘There he goes!’

‘How fortunate we are, too,’ I returned, ‘to have arrived to witness
their happiness in that intended marriage! I never saw people so happy.
How delightful to see it, and to be made the sharers in their honest
joy, as we have been!’

‘Oh, you’ve come back, have you!’ said Mrs. Weller.

How long it was before he was aroused from his contemplation of this
creature, whom he dreaded so—whether half-an-hour, or half the night—he
knew not. But the stillness of the room was broken by the boy (whom he
had seen listening) starting up, and running towards the door.

"I made an observation to my friend, sir," replied Mr. Pickwick, always
ready to enter into conversation. "I wondered at what house the Bath
coach put up. Perhaps you can inform me?"

As Mr Brass advanced to remedy this accident, the Notary shrunk from
him with an air of disgust.  Brass, who over and above his usual
prepossessing qualities, had a scratched face, a green shade over one
eye, and a hat grievously crushed, stopped short, and looked round with
a pitiful smile.

Toby's nose was very red, and his eyelids were very red, and he winked
very much, and his shoulders were very near his ears, and his legs were
very stiff, and altogether he was evidently a long way upon the frosty
side of cool.

‘Well,’ returned Dennis, ‘I don’t object to company, brother. I rather
like company. I was formed for society, I was.’

“Ask who is arrived.”

Savage, i. 271

‘Why should she give herself up to the dressmaker?’ asked Bradley.

The tone in which he spoke warned Mrs. Goldstraw that it would be cruel
kindness to let him comfort himself a moment longer with the vain hope
that she might be wrong.  A few words more would end it, and those few
words she determined to speak.

They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted
meal was removed; and with looks which shewed that their thoughts
were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and,
at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald
his departure. Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching
footstep, and they both involuntarily darted towards the door, as Mr.
Losberne entered.

It was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene, and the nights
brought with them no fear or care; no languishing in a wretched prison,
or associating with wretched men: nothing but pleasant and happy
thoughts. Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who
lived near the little church, who taught him to read better, and to
write, and spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could
never try enough to please him. Then he would walk with Mrs. Maylie
and Rose, and hear them talk of books, or perhaps sit near them, in
some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read, which he could
have done till it grew too dark to see the letters. Then he had his own
lesson for the next day to prepare, and at this he would work hard, in
a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly
on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them; listening
with such pleasure to all they said, and so happy if they wanted a
flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could
run to fetch, that he could never be quick enough about it. When it
became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit
down to the piano, and play some melancholy air, or sing, in a low and
gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear. There
would be no candles at such times as these, and Oliver would sit by one
of the windows, listening to the sweet music, while tears of tranquil
joy stole down his face.

‘“Just serves you right, old boy,” thought Tom Smart; but he didn’t say
anything.

‘No, no, no!’ cried Smike, clinging to him. ‘Hold me tight. Don’t let me
go. There, there. Behind the tree!’

Three young ladies, one young man, and the mamma of the party, receive
the military young gentleman with great warmth and politeness, and in
five minutes afterwards the military young gentleman, stimulated by the
mamma, introduces the two other military young gentlemen with whom he was
walking in the morning, who take their seats behind the young ladies and
commence conversation; whereat the mamma bestows a triumphant bow upon a
rival mamma, who has not succeeded in decoying any military young
gentlemen, and prepares to consider her visitors from that moment three
of the most elegant and superior young gentlemen in the whole world.

"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are," she
returned. "I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in
heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how
keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I
_have_ thought of it, and can release you."

I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time. When
Agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival, I was as miserable as when I
saw her going away. Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state, this
subject was sure to present itself, and all my uneasiness was sure to be
redoubled. Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it. It became a
part of my life, and as inseparable from my life as my own head.

“Can’t say,” said I.

‘What is her history?’ asked Clennam.

"It is the only thing now thought of," said the man.

‘That will be as you please, Mr Boffin. I hold myself quite at your
disposal. You know where I live at present.’

‘And could you steal, disguised, into the house of your old friend?’
rejoined the Carrier.  ‘There was a frank boy once—how many years is it,
Caleb, since we heard that he was dead, and had it proved, we
thought?—who never would have done that.’

ROME, _Tuesday, February 4th, 1845._

"Perhaps, under such circumstances, madam and gentlemen," said Mr.
Micawber, "you will do me the favor to submit yourselves, for the
moment, to the direction of one, who, however unworthy to be regarded in
any other light but as a Waif and Stray upon the shore of human nature,
is still your fellow man, though crushed out of his original form by
individual errors, and the accumulative force of a combination of
circumstances?"

“Ah!” said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver’s eyes.
“It is gone, you see.”

‘“Pooh, pooh,” said the old gentleman. “I know all about that.”

‘_A quarter past twelve_.

The foot bears the fatigue wonderfully well, and really occasions me no
inconvenience beyond the necessity of wearing the big work of art. Syme
saw me again this morning, and utterly scouted the gout notion
altogether. I think the Edinburgh audience understood the "Murder"
better last night than any audience that has heard it yet. "Business" is
enormous, and Dolby jubilant.

There was one change in my condition, which, while it relieved me of
a great deal of present uneasiness, might have made me, if I had been
capable of considering it closely, yet more uncomfortable about the
future. It was this. The constraint that had been put upon me, was quite
abandoned. I was so far from being required to keep my dull post in
the parlour, that on several occasions, when I took my seat there, Miss
Murdstone frowned to me to go away. I was so far from being warned off
from Peggotty’s society, that, provided I was not in Mr. Murdstone’s, I
was never sought out or inquired for. At first I was in daily dread of
his taking my education in hand again, or of Miss Murdstone’s
devoting herself to it; but I soon began to think that such fears were
groundless, and that all I had to anticipate was neglect.

(FLETCHER'S "Faithful Shepherdess.")

We encamped near a solitary log-house, for the sake of its water, and
dined upon the plain.  The baskets contained roast fowls, buffalo’s
tongue (an exquisite dainty, by the way), ham, bread, cheese, and butter;
biscuits, champagne, sherry; lemons and sugar for punch; and abundance of
rough ice.  The meal was delicious, and the entertainers were the soul of
kindness and good humour.  I have often recalled that cheerful party to
my pleasant recollection since, and shall not easily forget, in
junketings nearer home with friends of older date, my boon companions on
the Prairie.

From looking down the Line, he turned himself about again, and,
raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.

‘I beg your pardon,’ answered Tom. ‘I thought you meant that, or I
wouldn’t have said it.’

If I may so express it, I was steeped in Dora. I was not merely over
head and ears in love with her, but I was saturated through and through.
Enough love might have been wrung out of me, metaphorically speaking, to
drown anybody in; and yet there would have remained enough within me,
and all over me, to pervade my entire existence.

“Not so heavy as they might be,” said the Jew, after looking at the
insides carefully; “but very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman,
ain’t he, Oliver?”

‘They kept me very short,’ said the small servant.  ‘Oh! you can’t
think how short they kept me!  So I used to come out at night after
they’d gone to bed, and feel about in the dark for bits of biscuit, or
sangwitches that you’d left in the office, or even pieces of orange
peel to put into cold water and make believe it was wine.  Did you ever
taste orange peel and water?’

“My dear Louisa, I shall really be proud, soon,” said Miss Tox.

Pushkin himself was not more dexterous; and, like him, our hero in the
course of his career signalised himself by several rencontres which
proved fatal to his antagonists, into the details of but one of which
I shall enter. He heard that nothing gives a young man greater _éclat_
at starting into society than a duel. Among those who frequented
the _salle_ was an old officer who had served in the campaigns of
Napoleon, one of the _reliquiæ Danaum_, the few survivors of Moscow;
for those who did not perish on the road, mostly fell victims to the
congelations and fatigues of that memorable retreat. Mascalbruni,
now a match for the _maître d'armes_, frequently exercised with this
old _grognard_, who had the character of being a _crane_, if not a
_bourreau des cranes_;[12] and one day, before a numerous _gallerie_,
having struck the foil out of his hand, the fencer so far forgot
himself, in the shame and vexation of defeat by a youngster, as to pick
up the weapon and strike the Italian a blow on the shoulders with the
flat part of the foil, if it be not an Irishism so to call it. Those
who saw Mascalbruni at that moment would not have forgotten the traits
of his countenance. His eyes flashed with a sombre fire; his Moorish
complexion assumed a darker hue, as the blood rushed from his heart to
his brain in an almost suffocating tide; his breath came forth in long
and audible expirations; his features were convulsed with the rage
of a demoniac. I only describe what Horace Verney, who was present,
faithfully sketched from memory after the scene. Mascalbruni, tearing
off the button of his foil, vociferated, putting himself in position,
"_A la mort, à la mort!_" The lookers-on were panic-stricken; but the
silence was interrupted by the clinking of the steel. The aggressor
soon lay stretched in the agonies of death.

Mrs. Cannon, and all the Cannons, great-guns and small-arms, were
terrified, and fancied the worthy man was out of his senses. She
proposed to send for Mr. Hiccup.

It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The
undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know
it was the apartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in;
Oliver followed him.

‘For the present, Loo Bounderby,’ said her husband, ‘here’s Mrs. Sparsit
to look after.  Mrs. Sparsit’s nerves have been acted upon by this
business, and she’ll stay here a day or two.  So make her comfortable.’

Lightwood was at home when he got to the Chambers, and had dined alone
there. Eugene drew a chair to the fire by which he was having his wine
and reading the evening paper, and brought a glass, and filled it for
good fellowship’s sake.

Next day, the House of Commons send into the City to let the Lord Mayor
know that their privileges are invaded by the King, and that there is
no safety for anybody or anything. Then, when the five members are gone
out of the way, down comes the King himself, with all his guard and
from two to three hundred gentlemen and soldiers, of whom the greater
part were armed. These he leaves in the hall; and then, with his nephew
at his side, goes into the House, takes off his hat, and walks up to
the Speaker’s chair. The Speaker leaves it, the King stands in front of
it, looks about him steadily for a little while, and says he has come
for those five members. No one speaks, and then he calls John Pym by
name. No one speaks, and then he calls Denzil Hollis by name. No one
speaks, and then he asks the Speaker of the House where those five
members are? The Speaker, answering on his knee, nobly replies that he
is the servant of that House, and that he has neither eyes to see, nor
tongue to speak, anything but what the House commands him. Upon this,
the King, beaten from that time evermore, replies that he will seek
them himself, for they have committed treason; and goes out, with his
hat in his hand, amid some audible murmurs from the members.

At the close of the war he was made a Knight of the Bath. When
Napoleon landed from Elba, Wellington, in forming his staff, insisted
on having De Lancey appointed as his Quartermaster-General. The
officer really entitled to the promotion was Sir William's
brother-in-law, Sir Hudson Lowe;[12] but as Wellington had conceived
a dislike for him, he refused to accept that officer in that capacity.
The military authorities, however, insisted on his appointment, and it
was only when Wellington made the promotion of De Lancey a _sine quâ
non_ of his acceptance of the supreme command that the former
yielded.[13] Six weeks before the battle of Waterloo, Sir William
married the daughter of Sir James Hall[14] of Dunglass, the Scottish
scientist. His bride accompanied him on the Continent. On the second
day of the battle[15] Sir William was knocked from his horse by a
spent cannon-ball, and it was at first supposed that he had been
instantly killed. Thirty-six hours afterwards he was discovered, still
alive and in his senses, but incapable of motion, although without any
visible wound. Notwithstanding the skill of the surgeons, and the
tender care of his wife, he succumbed to his injuries nine days after
the battle.[16]

‘I want you to wear this next Monday, Twigger,’ said the Mayor.

‘And I’ll say so again, my love,’ I returned, ‘a thousand times!’

She crept among the trees to the trunk of a tree whence she could see,
beyond some intervening trees and branches, the lighted windows, both in
their reality and their reflection in the water. She placed her orderly
little basket at her side, and sank upon the ground, supporting herself
against the tree. It brought to her mind the foot of the Cross, and
she committed herself to Him who died upon it. Her strength held out to
enable her to arrange the letter in her breast, so as that it could
be seen that she had a paper there. It had held out for this, and it
departed when this was done.

"Ah! you should keep dogs--fine animals--sagacious creatures--dog of my
own once--Pointer--surprising instinct--out shooting one day--entering
enclosure--whistled--dog stopped--whistled again--Ponto--no go; stock
still--called him--Ponto, Ponto--wouldn't move--dog transfixed--staring
at a board--looked up, saw an inscription--'Gamekeeper has orders to
shoot all dogs found in this enclosure'--wouldn't pass it--wonderful
dog--valuable dog that--very."

We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge
where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison
rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much
neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all
public wrongdoing—and which is always its heaviest and longest
punishment—was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better
than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their
prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their
soup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was
going his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,
were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,
disorderly, depressing scene it was.

"It seems the poorest nonsense in the world to turn to anything else,
that is, seems to me being fresher in respect of Lady De Lancey than
you--but my raven's dead. He had been ailing for a few days but not
seriously, as we thought, and was apparently recovering, when symptoms
of relapse occasioned me to send for an eminent medical gentleman one
Herring (a bird fancier in the New Road), who promptly attended and
administered a powerful dose of castor oil. This was on Tuesday last.
On Wednesday morning he had another dose of castor oil and a tea cup
full of warm gruel, which he took with great relish and under the
influence of which he so far recovered his spirits as to be enabled to
bite the groom severely. At 12 o'clock at noon he took several turns
up and down the stable with a grave, sedate air, and suddenly reeled.
This made him thoughtful. He stopped directly, shook his head, moved
on again, stopped once more, cried in a tone of remonstrance and
considerable surprise, 'Halloa old girl!' and immediately died.

"Why, that you were a good wife," replied Bob.

‘I do, indeed,’ answered Oliver. ‘I have not slept under a roof
since I left the country.’

Mr. Goodchild looked at Idle, but Idle lay with his head enwreathed in
smoke.

“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.

And where did Plornish live? Plornish lived in Bleeding Heart Yard. He
was ‘only a plasterer,’ Little Dorrit said, as a caution to him not to
form high social expectations of Plornish. He lived at the last house in
Bleeding Heart Yard, and his name was over a little gateway.

The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for
the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed
interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious
assault on the breakfast.

Just after I had sent the messenger off to you, yesterday, concerning
the toll-taker memoranda, the other idea came into my head, and in the
most obliging manner came out of it.

I had started at a real sound, and the sound was on the steps of the
cart.  It was the light hurried tread of a child, coming clambering up.
That tread of a child had once been so familiar to me, that for half a
moment I believed I was a-going to see a little ghost.

They found the house, read the brass plate, walked round the wall, and
stopped at that portion of it which divided them from the bottom of the
garden.

"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!" said Scrooge to the Ghost. "Bless me, yes.
There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick!
Dear, dear!"

I.

“Hope, my dear Wally. Hope that we shall meet again, on this side of
the grave. Send me as much of that as you can.”

“Now, Rick!” said he. “I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is
as good as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.
Warm yourself!”

‘Well, sir, considern’ the Wings of Love, they are,’ said Mrs Gamp.

‘I am telling you the truth, Barbara, upon my word, but not half so
strong as I could wish,’ said Kit.  ‘When I want you to be pleased to
see Miss Nell, it’s only because I like you to be pleased with what
pleases me--that’s all.  As to her, Barbara, I think I could almost die
to do her service, but you would think so too, if you knew her as I do.
I am sure you would.’

Then Mr. Lillyvick talked to the company about his niece's marriage, and
said graciously that he had always found Mr. Kenwigs a very honest,
well-behaved, upright, and respectable sort of man, and shook hands with
him, and then Morleena and her sisters kissed their uncle and most of
the guests.

‘I’ve only got to say this here,’ said Sam, stopping short, ‘that if I
was the properiator o’ the Markis o’ Granby, and that ‘ere Stiggins came
and made toast in my bar, I’d--’

As his unusual emotion subsided, these misgivings gradually melted
away, though so much of their shadow remained behind, that he was
constant in his resolution to look closely after Richards himself,
without appearing to do so. Being now in an easier frame of mind, he
regarded the woman’s station as rather an advantageous circumstance
than otherwise, by placing, in itself, a broad distance between her and
the child, and rendering their separation easy and natural. Thence he
passed to the contemplation of the future glories of Dombey and Son,
and dismissed the memory of his wife, for the time being, with a
tributary sigh or two.

“Exactly so,” said I.

“My dear ma’am,” returns Mr. Guppy, moving across the small
apartment, “the humble individual who now addresses you received that
young lady in London when she first came here from the establishment
to which you have alluded. Allow me to have the pleasure of taking
you by the hand.”

‘There was--pardon me--really such a person, and at all in his power?’
hinted Traddles.

‘Are you sure you have left nothing out of it?’ asked Bella.

‘Will you trust me?’ she asked, in a low voice of astonishment.

"Very," said Dodson, opening the door.

I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the
door of my room and begged me to get up directly. On my hurrying to
speak to him and learn what had happened, he told me, after a word or
two of preparation, that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester
Dedlock’s. That my mother had fled, that a person was now at our door
who was empowered to convey to her the fullest assurances of
affectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find
her, and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my
entreaties might prevail upon her if his failed. Something to this
general purpose I made out, but I was thrown into such a tumult of
alarm, and hurry and distress, that in spite of every effort I could
make to subdue my agitation, I did not seem, to myself, fully to
recover my right mind until hours had passed.

"Tired," echoed Caleb, with a great burst in his manner, "what should
tire me, Bertha? _I_ was never tired. What does it mean?"

"We will," was the animated cry of three voices.

The other occasion, referred to in a previous chapter, that Grimaldi
had the honour of conversing with the Duke of York, was in 1824, when
his Royal Highness took the chair at the Theatrical Fund dinner, and
kindly inquiring after his health, of some one who sat near him,
desired to see him. He was officiating as one of the stewards, but
was of course surprised at the Duke's wish, and immediately presented
himself. He received him with great kindness, and hearing from his own
lips that his infirmities had compelled him to relinquish the exercise
of his profession, said, he was extremely sorry to hear him say so, but
heartily trusted, notwithstanding, that he might recover yet, for his
loss would be a "national calamity." He added, when Grimaldi expressed
his acknowledgments, "I remember your father well: he was a funny man,
and taught me and some of my sisters to dance. If ever I can be of any
service to you, Grimaldi, call upon me freely."

When, on the following day, Giovanna’s servant announced the Counts
Selka and Roszynski, a peculiar smile played on her lips; and when they
entered, she received the latter with the cold and formal politeness of
a stranger. Controlling the feelings of her heart, she schooled her
features to an expression of indifference. It was manifest from Leon’s
manner, that without the remotest recognition, an indefinable
presentiment regarding her possessed him. The Counts had called to know
if Giovanna had recovered from her indisposition. Leon begged to be
permitted to call again.

“And I, sir, have long known you by reputation as a man of taste. Let
me fill your glass. I will give you, sir,” says Mr. Sapsea, filling his
own:

I thank you for a terrible awaking,
And if reproach seemed hidden in my pain,
And sorrow seemed to cry on your disdain,
Know that my blessing lay in your forsaking.

II. THE HYMN OF THE WILTSHIRE LABOURERS

‘You are known to me now. There are no reproaches I could heap upon your
head which would carry with them one thousandth part of the grovelling
shame that this assurance will awaken even in your breast.

The Out-and-out Young Gentleman

Saying this with great fervour, and disregarding the old man’s broken
remonstrances, Walter dashed out of the shop again as hard as he could
go; and, having hurried round to the office to excuse himself on the
plea of his Uncle’s sudden illness, set off, full speed, for Captain
Cuttle’s residence.

“This is the boy, your worship,” said Mr. Bumble.

‘Bah! Stuff and nonsense!’ said my aunt. ‘Don’t talk to me!’

This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who
with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward
to interfere.

Sam shook his head.

“Well, sir?”

Small, shining, neat, methodical, and buxom was Miss Peecher;
cherry-cheeked and tuneful of voice. A little pincushion, a little
housewife, a little book, a little workbox, a little set of tables and
weights and measures, and a little woman, all in one. She could write
a little essay on any subject, exactly a slate long, beginning at the
left-hand top of one side and ending at the right-hand bottom of the
other, and the essay should be strictly according to rule. If Mr Bradley
Headstone had addressed a written proposal of marriage to her, she would
probably have replied in a complete little essay on the theme exactly a
slate long, but would certainly have replied Yes. For she loved him. The
decent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent
silver watch was an object of envy to her. So would Miss Peecher have
gone round his neck and taken care of him. Of him, insensible. Because
he did not love Miss Peecher.

Upon the deck, image to the roughest man on board of something that is
graceful, beautiful, and harmless—something that it is good and
pleasant to have there, and that should make the voyage prosperous—is
Florence. It is night, and she and Walter sit alone, watching the
solemn path of light upon the sea between them and the moon.

It was a pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick in the centre of the group,
now pulled this way, and then that, and first kissed on the chin and
then on the nose, and then on the spectacles, and to hear the peals of
laughter which were raised on every side; but it was a still more
pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick, blinded shortly afterwards, with a
silk-handkerchief, falling up against the wall, and scrambling into
corners, and going through all the mysteries of blind-man’s buff, with
the utmost relish for the game, until at last he caught one of the poor
relations; and then had to evade the blind-man himself, which he did
with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause
of all beholders. The poor relations caught just the people whom they
thought would like it; and when the game flagged, got caught themselves.
When they were all tired of blind-man’s buff, there was a great game at
snapdragon, and when fingers enough were burned with that, and all the
raisins gone, they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a
substantial supper, and a mighty bowl of wassail, something smaller than
an ordinary wash-house copper, in which the hot apples were hissing and
bubbling with a rich look, and a jolly sound, that were perfectly
irresistible.

‘Mr Wrayburn.’

Among the people who drop into St. Peter’s at their leisure, to kneel on
the pavement, and say a quiet prayer, there are certain schools and
seminaries, priestly and otherwise, that come in, twenty or thirty
strong.  These boys always kneel down in single file, one behind the
other, with a tall grim master in a black gown, bringing up the rear:
like a pack of cards arranged to be tumbled down at a touch, with a
disproportionately large Knave of clubs at the end.  When they have had a
minute or so at the chief altar, they scramble up, and filing off to the
chapel of the Madonna, or the sacrament, flop down again in the same
order; so that if anybody did stumble against the master, a general and
sudden overthrow of the whole line must inevitably ensue.

At first, the current of people had been confined to the two pathways,
and but a few more eager stragglers kept the road. But after half an
hour or so, the passage was completely blocked up by the great press,
which, being now closely wedged together, and impeded by the carts and
coaches it encountered, moved but slowly, and was sometimes at a stand
for five or ten minutes together.

"You will do better, poor fellow," replied Nicholas, shaking his head
mournfully, "when I am gone."

"Wery good," said Sam, "stick a bit o' Christmas in 'em. T'other dish
opposite. There; now we look compact and comfortable, as the father
said ven he cut his little boy's head off, to cure him of squintin'."

‘Not so poor as you think, my dear,’ returned Bella, ‘if you knew all.’
Indeed, though attained by some wonderful winding narrow stairs, which
seemed to have been erected in a pure white chimney, and though very low
in the ceiling, and very rugged in the floor, and rather blinking as
to the proportions of its lattice window, it was a pleasanter room than
that despised chamber once at home, in which Bella had first bemoaned
the miseries of taking lodgers.

By an evening train he re-appeared. When thirty miles off, he had wanted
his purse, and it was gone. It had no doubt paid for the gypsies’ final
gratitude.

CHAPTER XXV. SHOWING, AMONG A VARIETY OF PLEASANT MATTERS, HOW MAJESTIC
AND IMPARTIAL MR. NUPKINS WAS; AND HOW MR. WELLER RETURNED MR. JOB
TROTTER’S SHUTTLECOCK AS HEAVILY AS IT CAME--WITH ANOTHER MATTER, WHICH
WILL BE FOUND IN ITS PLACE

"I supposed it was some public mission," observed Mr. Pickwick.

“Why, what IS done?” says Richard, turning gloomily upon him.

The officer had got no farther than the 'You shall well and truly
    try,' when he was again interrupted by the chemist.

SIR,--I write to you concerning the late P.P. of this parish--his soul
to glory! for, as Virgil says,--and devil a doubt of it,--

Ever since her last momentous conversation with her son, Mrs. Nickleby
had begun to display unusual care in the adornment of her person,
gradually superadding to those staid and matronly habiliments,
which had, up to that time, formed her ordinary attire, a variety of
embellishments and decorations, slight perhaps in themselves, but,
taken together, and considered with reference to the subject of
her disclosure, of no mean importance. Even her black dress assumed
something of a deadly-lively air from the jaunty style in which it was
worn; and, eked out as its lingering attractions were; by a prudent
disposal, here and there, of certain juvenile ornaments of little or no
value, which had, for that reason alone, escaped the general wreck and
been permitted to slumber peacefully in odd corners of old drawers and
boxes where daylight seldom shone, her mourning garments assumed quite
a new character. From being the outward tokens of respect and sorrow for
the dead, they became converted into signals of very slaughterous and
killing designs upon the living.

‘You are the demdest, knowing hand,’ replied Mr. Mantalini, in an
admiring tone, ‘the cunningest, rummest, superlativest old fox--oh
dem!--to pretend now not to know that it was the little bright-eyed
niece--the softest, sweetest, prettiest--’

The next day there was another visit to Doctors’ Commons, and a great
to-do with an attesting hostler, who, being inebriated, declined
swearing anything but profane oaths, to the great scandal of a proctor
and surrogate. Next week, there were more visits to Doctors’ Commons,
and there was a visit to the Legacy Duty Office besides, and there were
treaties entered into, for the disposal of the lease and business, and
ratifications of the same, and inventories to be made out, and lunches
to be taken, and dinners to be eaten, and so many profitable things to
be done, and such a mass of papers accumulated that Mr. Solomon Pell,
and the boy, and the blue bag to boot, all got so stout that scarcely
anybody would have known them for the same man, boy, and bag, that had
loitered about Portugal Street, a few days before.

"Plates, Joe, plates." A similar process employed in the distribution
of the crockery.

Now, I have heard many preachers since that time—not powerful; merely
Christian, unaffected, and reverential—and I have had many such preachers
on my roll of friends.  But, it was not to hear these, any more than the
powerful class, that I made my Sunday journeys.  They were journeys of
curiosity to the numerous churches in the City of London.  It came into
my head one day, here had I been cultivating a familiarity with all the
churches of Rome, and I knew nothing of the insides of the old churches
of London!  This befell on a Sunday morning.  I began my expeditions that
very same day, and they lasted me a year.

Before Bob could reply, Mr. Ben Allen seized Mr. Pickwick by the hand,
and murmured, in sorrowful accents, ‘My sister, my dear Sir; my sister.’

These circumstances of atrocity have been verified by affidavit, sworn
by Crawford’s widow, the 20th day of August 1798. The fidelity of a
large dog, belonging to this poor man, deserves to be recorded, as he
attacked those sanguinary monsters in defence of his master, till he
fell by his side perforated with pikes.’

‘I take Mr Pinch, or go alone,’ said Martin. ‘Which shall it be?’

We dined alone, we three together. He seemed to be very fond of my
mother--I am afraid I liked him none the better for that--and she was
very fond of him. I gathered from what they said, that an elder sister
of his was coming to stay with them, and that she was expected that
evening. I am not certain whether I found out then, or afterwards, that,
without being actively concerned in any business, he had some share in,
or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant’s house
in London, with which his family had been connected from his
great-grandfather’s time, and in which his sister had a similar
interest; but I may mention it in this place, whether or no.

An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted, Mr.
Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers
romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged,
involving various interesting anecdotes of a thorough-bred horse, and a
magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the
nobility and gentry of these kingdoms.

A NEW SONG, BUT AN OLD STORY

_Mrs. M._ More shame for him, Fred!

“I begin to believe it possible that he may have disappeared of his own
accord, and may yet be alive and well.”

‘To keep it up. To help myself in my turn, as the man before me helps
himself in his, and pass the bottle of smoke. To keep up the pretence
as to labour, and study, and patience, and being devoted to my art, and
giving up many solitary days to it, and abandoning many pleasures for
it, and living in it, and all the rest of it--in short, to pass the
bottle of smoke according to rule.’

"But when I came to the second part of what had been entrusted to me,"
said Mr. Littimer, rubbing his hands, uneasily, "which anybody might
have supposed would have been, at all events, appreciated as a kind
intention, then the young woman came out in her true colors. A more
outrageous person I never did see. Her conduct was surprisingly bad. She
had no more gratitude, no more feeling, no more patience, no more reason
in her, than a stock or a stone. If I hadn't been upon my guard, I am
convinced she would have had my blood."

Sir Mulberry Hawk honoured him with an angry glance, but condescended
to return no verbal answer to this inquiry. Both walked sullenly on, as
though their thoughts were busily occupied, until they were quite clear
of the crowd, and almost alone, when Sir Mulberry wheeled round to
return.

Where had he been in his time? he repeated, when I asked him the
question.  Lord, he had been everywhere!  And what had he been?  Bless
you, he had been everything you could mention a'most!

"Mr. Dick," said Miss Trotwood, "what shall I do with this child?"

‘Move them, my lord! Move them! They cried to be led on against the
Papists, they vowed a dreadful vengeance on their heads, they roared

"Is there no help in Heaven!" cried Conla, as, after another appeal in
vain to their persecutor, he threw his eyes up with a reproachful glance.

dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that
time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not to be
resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the
window, clasped its robe in supplication.

Mr. Micawber folded his arms in a resolute manner, as if he were then
stationed on the figure-head.

‘How do you find yourself?’ said Mr. Dick, with an anxious look.

“Ah! Little Miss Flite!” he said. “She lives the same life yet?”

Love to Lætitia.
                                                  Ever affectionately.

‘That’ll do,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘I’ll go there directly I have finished
my breakfast.’

‘A miserable wretch,’ exclaimed Mr. Knag, striking his forehead. ‘A
miserable wretch.’

"Mr. Scrooge?"

Hullah, John, i. 5; ii. 131

‘“And I forbade you this house, long ago.”

“My darling Esther!” murmured Ada. “I have a great secret to tell
you!”

We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if
we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had
taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After
a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two
or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went
on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then
about high-water,—half-past eight.

‘Yes, sir’; replied the servant. ‘The old gentleman, the
housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow’s, all
went together.’

“Artistically speaking, the story of Sikes and Nancy ends at the point
here indicated.  Throughout the entire scene of the murder, from the
entrance of Sikes into the house until the catastrophe, the silence was
intense—the old phrase ‘a pin might have been heard to drop,’ could have
been legitimately employed.  It was a great study to watch the faces of
the people—eager, excited, intent—permitted for once in a life-time to be
natural, forgetting to be British, and cynical, and unimpassioned.  The
great strength of this feeling did not last into the concluding five
minutes.  The people were earnest and attentive; but the wild excitement
so seldom seen amongst us died as Nancy died, and the rest was somewhat
of an anti-climax.

Upon further inquiry, it turned out, to the good lady’s unbounded
astonishment, that Smike had, that moment, gone upstairs to bed.

Well!  I made no halt there, and I soon dropped the very queer small boy
and went on.  Over the road where the old Romans used to march, over the
road where the old Canterbury pilgrims used to go, over the road where
the travelling trains of the old imperious priests and princes used to
jingle on horseback between the continent and this Island through the mud
and water, over the road where Shakespeare hummed to himself, ‘Blow,
blow, thou winter wind,’ as he sat in the saddle at the gate of the inn
yard noticing the carriers; all among the cherry orchards, apple
orchards, corn-fields, and hop-gardens; so went I, by Canterbury to
Dover.  There, the sea was tumbling in, with deep sounds, after dark, and
the revolving French light on Cape Grinez was seen regularly bursting out
and becoming obscured, as if the head of a gigantic light-keeper in an
anxious state of mind were interposed every half-minute, to look how it
was burning.

"And you, Agnes," I said, by and by. "Tell me of yourself. You have
hardly ever told me of your own life, in all this lapse of time!"

‘To be sure!’ cried Hugh.

Mr. Potter and Mr. Smithers had mutually agreed that, on the receipt of
their quarter’s salary, they would jointly and in company ‘spend the
evening’—an evident misnomer—the spending applying, as everybody knows,
not to the evening itself but to all the money the individual may
chance to be possessed of, on the occasion to which reference is made;
and they had likewise agreed that, on the evening aforesaid, they would
‘make a night of it’—an expressive term, implying the borrowing of
several hours from to-morrow morning, adding them to the night before,
and manufacturing a compound night of the whole.

‘It’s very comforting,’ said Mrs. Corney.

“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “Allow me to lead the way. I
am rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out tolerably
well till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably
through to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk
about London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As
to our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied
from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your
expense, such being Mr. Jaggers’s directions. As to our lodging, it’s
not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my
father hasn’t anything to give me, and I shouldn’t be willing to take
it, if he had. This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tables
and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You
mustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,
because they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little
bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;
the furniture’s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the
purpose; if you should want anything, I’ll go and fetch it. The
chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan’t
fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you’re holding the
fruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite
ashamed.”

By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn
up; and people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at
Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they
hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire
how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.

‘Jarley’s Wax-Work,’ repeated Nell.

‘You are wery obligin’, sir,’ replied Sam. ‘Now, don’t allow yourself to
be fatigued beyond your powers; there’s a amiable bein’. Consider what
you owe to society, and don’t let yourself be injured by too much work.
For the sake o’ your feller-creeturs, keep yourself as quiet as you can;
only think what a loss you would be!’ With these pathetic words, Sam
Weller departed.

“J.”

The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.

Small errors in punctuation were corrected without note, also the
following changes were made, on page

After a silence, she loosed him, to dry her eyes and regain her strong
quiet influence.

‘Now, young ‘un!’ said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St.
Andrew’s Church, ‘hard upon seven! you must step out. Come, don’t
lag behind already, Lazy-legs!’

Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful
Dependent—I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,
they will improve.”

When they had hurriedly refreshed and changed, they went together to the
house of business of Defresnier and Company.  There they found the letter
which the wine-carrier had described, enclosing the tests and comparisons
of handwriting essential to the discovery of the Forger.  Vendale's
determination to press forward, without resting, being already taken, the
only question to delay them was by what Pass could they cross the Alps?
Respecting the state of the two Passes of the St. Gotthard and the
Simplon, the guides and mule-drivers differed greatly; and both passes
were still far enough off, to prevent the travellers from having the
benefit of any recent experience of either.  Besides which, they well
knew that a fall of snow might altogether change the described conditions
in a single hour, even if they were correctly stated.  But, on the whole,
the Simplon appearing to be the hopefuller route, Vendale decided to take
it.  Obenreizer bore little or no part in the discussion, and scarcely
spoke.

"The other party, and a surgeon, I suppose," said Mr. Snodgrass; "take
a drop of brandy." Mr. Winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend
proffered, and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid.

"The little girl--at the house of the barber."

“By me,” said Mr. Brownlow. “I told you I should interest you before
long. I say by me—I see that your cunning associate suppressed my
name, although, for aught he knew, it would be quite strange to your
ears. When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness
in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of
struck me with astonishment. Even when I first saw him, in all his
dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that
came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a
vivid dream. I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his
history—”

"That's right," said my aunt. "I augur all sorts of good from your
sensible decision."

“Drive on!” he cried, “hard, fast, full gallop; nothing short of flying
will keep pace with me to-day.”

‘Amy, my child,’ said Mr Dorrit, tempering a bland severity with a
dignified affection, ‘is this the case?’

The thunders roar, the lightnings glare,
Vain is it now to strive or dare;
A cry goes up of great despair,--
Miserere Domine.

‘Well, sir,’ said Mr Tapley. ‘In your old opinions of each other. As
to him, sir, and his opinions, I know he’s a altered man. I know it.
I know’d it long afore he spoke to you t’other day, and I must say it.
Nobody don’t know half as much of him as I do. Nobody can’t. There
was always a deal of good in him, but a little of it got crusted over,
somehow. I can’t say who rolled the paste of that ‘ere crust myself,
but--’

‘But where can I find you again when it is necessary?’ asked Rose.
‘I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where
will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this
time?’

Little Dorrit had been thinking too. After softly putting his grey hair
aside, and touching his forehead with her lips, she looked towards
Arthur, who came nearer to her, and pursued in a low whisper the subject
of her thoughts.

Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that
he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked
them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the
whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his
nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.

"Really, sir, this language----"

‘Why, it comes into my mind, do you know, sir,’ said Wegg with an air
of insinuating frankness (having first again looked hard at the book),
‘that you made a little mistake this morning, which I had meant to set
you right in, only something put it out of my head. I think you said
Rooshan Empire, sir?’

Captain Cuttle, in the exercise of that surprising talent for deep-laid
and unfathomable scheming, with which (as is not unusual in men of
transparent simplicity) he sincerely believed himself to be endowed by
nature, had gone to Mr Dombey’s house on the eventful Sunday, winking
all the way as a vent for his superfluous sagacity, and had presented
himself in the full lustre of the ankle-jacks before the eyes of
Towlinson. Hearing from that individual, to his great concern, of the
impending calamity, Captain Cuttle, in his delicacy, sheered off again
confounded; merely handing in the nosegay as a small mark of his
solicitude, and leaving his respectful compliments for the family in
general, which he accompanied with an expression of his hope that they
would lay their heads well to the wind under existing circumstances,
and a friendly intimation that he would “look up again” to-morrow.

‘What’s it?’ said Nicholas. ‘The name--the name, my dear fellow!’

Cambridge, Duke of, 117.

"My dear sir," urged the little man again.

If the house, and every one of us, had tumbled out into the river
together, I could hardly have received a greater shock.

A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet, mild, dejected creature that
harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused at last; the
cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His breast
heaved; his form was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person
changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay
crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known
before.

‘Now, pray don’t alarm yourself, my dear,’ said Mr. Pickwick soothingly.
‘There is not the least cause for fear, I assure you. Stand firm, Sam,’
said Mr. Pickwick, looking down.

It is curious, however, that no mention is made of Mrs. Bardell's
release.  It, of course, took place before Mr. Pickwick's.  Here again
Dodson and Fogg behaved very fairly, for they allowed both her and Mr.
Pickwick to be released, without receiving payment, but simply on "an
understanding" by Perker.  As it turned out, indeed, they were not paid
for some weeks.

The Uncommercial thought it might be worth trying.

"Is Miss Allen in the garden yet, Mary?" inquired Mr. Winkle, much
agitated.

In spite of the precautionary vigilance, Lord Gosford had the very
narrowest possible escape from death by assassination. His lodging was
situated at the summit of the hill which the Dublin road ascends. The
sentinel at his door, having his attention attracted by the entrance of
the rebel columns at the foot of the hill, was inexcusably so far off
his guard as to allow two pikemen, belonging to the town, to slip into
the hall, where they were ready to receive his lordship with their pikes
as he hurried from his chamber on the alarm. And they were very near
succeeding--but the sentinel turning about at the critical moment, shot
one and bayoneted the other, just as his lordship was rushing down the
stairs. The sentinel’s name was John Sandford; he was afterwards made a
sergeant, and his son a drummer.

‘Those presents that I took such care of; that came almost at my wish,
and were so dearly welcome to me,’ she said, trembling; ‘where did they
come from?  Did you send them?’

The animal looked up into his master’s face while these preparations
were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their
purpose, or the robber’s sidelong look at him was sterner than
ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and
cowered as he came more slowly along. When his master halted at the
brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.

So gaily the old Doctor carried it!  And the fire was piled up, and the
lights were bright, and company arrived, and a murmuring of lively
tongues began, and already there was a pleasant air of cheerful
excitement stirring through all the house.

What walks I took alone, down muddy lanes, in the bad winter weather,
carrying that parlour, and Mr. and Miss Murdstone in it, everywhere: a
monstrous load that I was obliged to bear, a daymare that there was
no possibility of breaking in, a weight that brooded on my wits, and
blunted them!

"What ceremony, my dear Traddles?"

‘They must not, indeed,’ rejoined Nicholas firmly, as he prepared to
leave the house.

“Oh I was a weak and trusting Fool when I took you under my roof,
Cap’en Cuttle, I was!” cried Mrs MacStinger. “To think of the benefits
I’ve showered on that man, and the way in which I brought my children
up to love and honour him as if he was a father to ’em, when there
ain’t a housekeeper, no nor a lodger in our street, don’t know that I
lost money by that man, and by his guzzlings and his muzzlings”—Mrs
MacStinger used the last word for the joint sake of alliteration and
aggravation, rather than for the expression of any idea—“and when they
cried out one and all, shame upon him for putting upon an industrious
woman, up early and late for the good of her young family, and keeping
her poor place so clean that a individual might have ate his dinner,
yes, and his tea too, if he was so disposed, off any one of the floors
or stairs, in spite of all his guzzlings and his muzzlings, such was
the care and pains bestowed upon him!”

‘Oh, but please will you come and show the lodgings,’ returned the
girl; ‘It’s eighteen shillings a week and us finding plate and linen.
Boots and clothes is extra, and fires in winter-time is eightpence a
day.’

“Where have you sprung up from?” inquires Mr. Guppy.

"Paul says, my lord, that he can see the banner of St. Austin, and the
bleeding heart of Hamo de Crevecoeur, the abbot's chief vassal; and
there is John de Northwood, the sheriff, with his red-cross engrailed;
and Hever, and Leybourne, and Heaven knows how many more; and they are
all coming on as fast as ever they can."

“I suppose you don’t even know what a prig is?” said the Dodger
mournfully.

But whither should I bend my course? Once or twice I thought of walking
home to the old town, stay some time with my mother and my brother, and
enjoy the pleasant walks in the neighbourhood; but, though I wished
very much to see my mother and my brother, and felt much disposed to
enjoy the said pleasant walks, the old town was not exactly the place
to which I wished to go at this present juncture. I was afraid the
people would ask, Where are your Northern Ballads? Where are your
alliterative translations from Ab Gwilym--of which you were always
talking, and with which you promised to astonish the world? Now, in the
event of such interrogations, what could I answer? It is true I had
compiled Newgate Lives and Trials, and had written the life of Joseph
Sell, but I was afraid that the people of the old town would scarcely
consider these as equivalents for the Northern Ballads and the songs of
Ab Gwilym. I would go forth and wander in any direction but that of the
old town.

Many authors entertain not only a foolish, but a really dishonest
objection to acknowledge the sources from whence they derive much
valuable information. We have no such feeling. We are merely
endeavouring to discharge, in an upright manner, the responsible duties
of our editorial functions; and whatever ambition we might have felt
under other circumstances to lay claim to the authorship of these
adventures, a regard for truth forbids us to do more than claim the
merit of their judicious arrangement and impartial narration. The
Pickwick papers are our New River Head; and we may be compared to the
New River Company. The labours of others have raised for us an immense
reservoir of important facts. We merely lay them on, and communicate
them, in a clear and gentle stream, through the medium of these
numbers, to a world thirsting for Pickwickian knowledge.

"I suppose so, indeed, or you wouldn't be sent for medicine.--You're
always making some blunder. You come here, and don't know what
description of medicine is wanted."

On the Monday evening, furnace fires and clanking hammers on the banks of
the canal, warned us that we approached the termination of this part of
our journey.  After going through another dreamy place—a long aqueduct
across the Alleghany River, which was stranger than the bridge at
Harrisburg, being a vast, low, wooden chamber full of water—we emerged
upon that ugly confusion of backs of buildings and crazy galleries and
stairs, which always abuts on water, whether it be river, sea, canal, or
ditch: and were at Pittsburg.

Had I lost the friend of my life, in the wreck of the Royal Charter; had
I lost my betrothed, the more than friend of my life; had I lost my
maiden daughter, had I lost my hopeful boy, had I lost my little child; I
would kiss the hands that worked so busily and gently in the church, and
say, ‘None better could have touched the form, though it had lain at
home.’  I could be sure of it, I could be thankful for it: I could be
content to leave the grave near the house the good family pass in and out
of every day, undisturbed, in the little churchyard where so many are so
strangely brought together.

CHAPTER XIX.
SHADOW ON THE SUN-DIAL

[Sidenote: The same.]

GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER, KENT,
                                     _Friday Night, Sept. 14th, 1860._

“Well! I’ll tell you the whole truth,” pursued his wife, penitently,
“and then perhaps you will. I felt all this, so much, when I was
trudging about in the cold, and when I saw a lot of other calculating
faces and large baskets trudging about, too, that I began to think
whether I mightn’t have done better, and been happier, if—I—hadn’t—” the
wedding-ring went round again, and Mrs. Tetterby shook her downcast head
as she turned it.

‘I can’t help it,’ cried Miggs. ‘I couldn’t, if I was to be drownded in
‘em. She has such a forgiving spirit! She’ll forget all that has passed,
and go along with you, sir--Oh, if it was to the world’s end, she’d go
along with you.’

I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed
any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,
I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply
seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew his
nose with an air of satisfaction.

‘Why the fact is,’ replied Mr. Winkle, looking at his blushing young
wife, ‘that I could not persuade Bella to run away, for a long time. And
when I had persuaded her, it was a long time more before we could find
an opportunity. Mary had to give a month’s warning, too, before she
could leave her place next door, and we couldn’t possibly have done it
without her assistance.’

_Scro._ No, no. I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to bring it
here, that I may give them the directions where to take it. Come back
with the man, and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less
than five minutes, and I'll gave you half a crown. That boy's off like a
shot. I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's. (_Rubbing his hands and
chuckling._) He shan't know who sent it. It's twice the size of Tiny
Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be. I
must write the directions for that turkey. (_Sits at table to write._)

"Very likely not," said I, with a tone of perfect nonchalance; "perhaps
it was one of Sheldrake's shoes; but it is of little consequence:--you
and I will never want one of such construction; that is one comfort,
however."

‘To--to Captain Bailey?’ I have just enough power to ask.

R. Wilfer locked up his desk one evening, and, putting his bunch of keys
in his pocket much as if it were his peg-top, made for home. His home
was in the Holloway region north of London, and then divided from it by
fields and trees. Between Battle Bridge and that part of the Holloway
district in which he dwelt, was a tract of suburban Sahara, where tiles
and bricks were burnt, bones were boiled, carpets were beat, rubbish was
shot, dogs were fought, and dust was heaped by contractors. Skirting
the border of this desert, by the way he took, when the light of its
kiln-fires made lurid smears on the fog, R. Wilfer sighed and shook his
head.

One day, a great many years ago, a gentleman ran up the steps of a tall
house in the neighborhood of St. Mary Axe.

‘Will you say Mrs. Orange and baby?’

CHAPTER 32 -- TREATS OF TODGER'S AGAIN; AND OF ANOTHER BLIGHTED PLANT BESIDES THE PLANTS UPON THE LEADS

“And here’s my bonny boy,” cried Mrs Brown, “at last!—oho, oho! You’re
like my own son, Robby!”

‘That,’ said Mr Pecksniff, ‘was very, very wrong. Take your time, Mr
Pinch.’

In the intentness with which she looked after him again, she made a
hasty gesture with her hand when the old woman began to reply, as if
her view could be obstructed by mere sound. Her mother watching her,
and not him, remained silent; until her kindling glance subsided, and
she drew a long breath, as if in the relief of his being gone.

In that little back parlor there are Chinese gongs; there are old
Saxe and Sevres plates; there is Furstenberg, Carl Theodor,
Worcester, Amstel, Nankin and other jimcrockery.  And in the corner
what do you think there is?  There is an actual GUILLOTINE.  If you
doubt me, go and see--Gale, High Holborn, No. 47.  It is a slim
instrument, much slighter than those which they make now;--some
nine feet high, narrow, a pretty piece of upholstery enough.  There
is the hook over which the rope used to play which unloosened the
dreadful ax above; and look! dropped into the orifice where the
head used to go--there is THE AX itself, all rusty, with A GREAT
NOTCH IN THE BLADE.

‘It is a brave thought!’ cried her grandfather.  ‘Mind, darling--we
begin to-morrow!’

‘Why the devil didn’t they say so at first?’ inquired Mr. Joseph Tuggs,
rather pettishly.

‘You do not doubt it, my lord?’ said the secretary.

“But he meant to be!” said I.

In a very little while he took his hand away and put it on his breast,
and went on with his story. ‘They often walked with me,’ he said, ‘in
the morning, maybe a mile or two upon my road; and when we parted, and
I said, “I’m very thankful to you! God bless you!” they always seemed to
understand, and answered pleasant. At last I come to the sea. It warn’t
hard, you may suppose, for a seafaring man like me to work his way
over to Italy. When I got theer, I wandered on as I had done afore. The
people was just as good to me, and I should have gone from town to town,
maybe the country through, but that I got news of her being seen among
them Swiss mountains yonder. One as know’d his servant see ‘em there,
all three, and told me how they travelled, and where they was. I made
fur them mountains, Mas’r Davy, day and night. Ever so fur as I went,
ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me. But I come up
with ‘em, and I crossed ‘em. When I got nigh the place as I had been
told of, I began to think within my own self, “What shall I do when I
see her?”’

Cavalletto had deferentially suggested the words and tune, supposing him
to have stopped short for want of more.

‘It won’t do, Job Trotter,’ said Sam. ‘Come! None o’ that ‘ere nonsense.
You ain’t so wery ‘andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o’
your good looks. Bring them ‘ere eyes o’ yourn back into their proper
places, or I’ll knock ‘em out of your head. D’ye hear?’

Richard, emerging from the heavy shade of Symond’s Inn into the
sunshine of Chancery Lane—for there happens to be sunshine there
to-day—walks thoughtfully on, and turns into Lincoln’s Inn, and
passes under the shadow of the Lincoln’s Inn trees. On many such
loungers have the speckled shadows of those trees often fallen; on
the like bent head, the bitten nail, the lowering eye, the lingering
step, the purposeless and dreamy air, the good consuming and
consumed, the life turned sour. This lounger is not shabby yet, but
that may come. Chancery, which knows no wisdom but in precedent, is
very rich in such precedents; and why should one be different from
ten thousand?

Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin’s cupidity, to the
banker’s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,
they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took
Oliver with them.

‘You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature’s on
the bark, Tom.’

‘However,’ said Pell, drawing a chair to the table, ‘a professional man
has no right to think of his private friendships when his legal
assistance is wanted. By the bye, gentlemen, since I saw you here
before, we have had to weep over a very melancholy occurrence.’

"You have not yet described to me the nature of the substance which
we are to explore, nor the process by which the virtues you impute
to it are to be extracted."

[Illustration]

[Illustration: LISTENING TO THE SEA--Chap. viii.]

‘We know a few secrets of nature in our profession, sir,’ said the
doctor. ‘Of course we do. We study for that; we pass the Hall and the
College for that; and we take our station in society BY that. It’s
extraordinary how little is known on these subjects generally. Where
do you suppose, now’--the doctor closed one eye, as he leaned back
smilingly in his chair, and formed a triangle with his hands, of which
his two thumbs composed the base--‘where do you suppose Mr Crimple’s
stomach is?’

[Sidenote: M. de Cerjat.]

He then went on to tell her where Mr Dombey was lying, and to request
that a carriage might be placed at his disposal to bring him home.

‘Matilda Maplesone.’

He pointed to the red light he had looked at.

‘Bob,’ said Mr. Ben Allen, laying down his knife and fork, and fixing
his eyes on the visage of his friend, ‘Bob, I’ll tell you what it is.’

That same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively
and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that
he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his
head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; to
which Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him, which,
although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a
wish of a totally opposite description.

"Nothing, nothing!  That is--nothing bad. I have come to tell you good
news."

‘Perceiving the necessity of it,’ acquiesced the schoolmaster, ‘and
making up her mind fully to the separation. Yes.’

"I thought it might be agreeable, my dear," said Mr. Omer. "But perhaps
you're right."

“Without their knowledge at home?” said I.

I breathed again.  He continued in the same tone, and without
noticing my looks.

‘Get up, pig!’ growled the first. ‘Don’t sleep when I am hungry.’

‘Sometimes,’ answered Charity. ‘Not often.’

Mr. Micawber was quite overcome by these friendly words, and by finding
Mr. Dick's hand again within his own. "It has been my lot," he observed,
"to meet, in the diversified panorama of human existence, with an
occasional oasis, but never with one so green, so gushing, as the
present!"

Oh, yes. When it’s moonlight! Of course. Oh, of course!
Conversational and acquiescent on both sides.

‘Perhaps, if you have no other engagement, you would not object for a
minute or two--’

‘A savage place indeed,’ said the insinuating traveller.

What could the child do with the knowledge she had, but give him every
penny that came into her hands, lest he should be tempted on to rob
their benefactress?  If she told the truth (so thought the child) he
would be treated as a madman; if she did not supply him with money, he
would supply himself; supplying him, she fed the fire that burnt him
up, and put him perhaps beyond recovery.  Distracted by these thoughts,
borne down by the weight of the sorrow which she dared not tell,
tortured by a crowd of apprehensions whenever the old man was absent,
and dreading alike his stay and his return, the colour forsook her
cheek, her eye grew dim, and her heart was oppressed and heavy.  All
her old sorrows had come back upon her, augmented by new fears and
doubts; by day they were ever present to her mind; by night they
hovered round her pillow, and haunted her in dreams.

"And of them Dodson and Foggs, as does these sort o' things on spec,"
continued Mr. Weller, "as well as for the other kind and gen'rous
people o' the same purfession, as sets people by the ears, free gratis
for nothing, and sets their clerks to work to find out little disputes
among their neighbours and acquaintances as vants settlin' by means o'
law-suits--all I can say o' them is, that I vish they had the reward
I'd give 'em."

With such muttered outpourings as these, the old gentleman shed a few
tears; but, they got him into the elbow-chair, and prevailed upon him,
without much pressing, to make a hearty supper, and by the time he had
finished his first pipe, and disposed of half-a-dozen glasses out of a
crown bowl of punch, ordered by Mr. Kenwigs, in celebration of his return
to the bosom of his family, he seemed, though still very humble, quite
resigned to his fate, and rather relieved than otherwise by the flight
of his wife.

In a rather ill-favoured and ill-savoured neighbourhood, though one
of its rising grounds bears the name of Mount Pleasant, the Elfin
Smallweed, christened Bartholomew and known on the domestic hearth as
Bart, passes that limited portion of his time on which the office and
its contingencies have no claim. He dwells in a little narrow street,
always solitary, shady, and sad, closely bricked in on all sides like
a tomb, but where there yet lingers the stump of an old forest tree
whose flavour is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed smack of
youth.

‘Back, ma’am--back!’ said the editor. ‘Take his hand before my very
face!’

‘Speak to her kindly,’ said the young lady to her companion. ‘Poor
creature! She seems to need it.’

Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new
clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the
dark, and locking the door behind him.

"Oh!" said Nell, with all possible humility.

‘It’s the other Mr. Tuggs,’ said the stranger, looking towards the
glass door which led into the parlour behind the shop, and on the
inside of which, the round face of Mr. Tuggs, senior, was distinctly
visible, peeping over the curtain.

This pious reasoning, and perhaps the fear of being too late, supported
the bride through the ceremony of robing, after which, strong tea and
brandy were administered in alternate doses as a means of strengthening
her feeble limbs and causing her to walk steadier.

"The gun-room officers, much obliged, will wait upon his lordship,"
returned Mr. Seymour; then, turning to Mr. Parallel, "Come, master; what
attracts your attention there to windward? The captain has sent us an
invitation to take our grog with him. Are you ready?"

‘I made as much haste down there as I could when I went from here, but
I had to go home first for the keys; and the wind and rain being dead
against me all the way, it was pretty well as much as I could do at
times to keep my legs. I got there at last, opened the church-door, and
went in. I had not met a soul all the way, and you may judge whether it
was dull or not. Neither of you would bear me company. If you could have
known what was to come, you’d have been in the right.

Chapter IX.

‘My master, sir, is a very artful man.’

‘She’ll have a nice life of it, if she goes there,’ observed the fat
lady, taking a pinch of snuff from a tin box.

‘You were eaves-dropping at that door, you vagabond!’ said this
gentleman.

‘Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes,’ murmured Wardle. ‘We
shall soon find out whether he is or not.’

"What, sir?"--"Soda-water; but, perhaps, you have not any."

“That! That!” replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. “The
white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should
die: it makes me tremble so.”

The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an
intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London.
The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy’s mind.

“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his
head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if
abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. “True.
The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn’t bring any, William.”

‘Without lime,’ returned that unmoved barrister-at-law, ‘my existence
would be unilluminated by a ray of hope.’

‘And you have such a cheerful spirit!’ he said, fondly. ‘You are like a
bright light in the house.’

‘Now, wait a bit, Boffin,’ Wegg proceeded, ‘there’s something more.
You’ve been a squandering this property—laying some of it out on
yourself. _That_ won’t do. You’ve bought a house. You’ll be charged for
it.’

The little man nodded his head, and showed his teeth; and yet seemed not
quite convinced that it was a surpassingly desirable arrangement.

Mr. Orange here came home from the city; and he came, too, with a
ring-ting-ting.

Mr. Pickwick had, of course, and so had Mr. Miles.  Jack and my deaf
friend were in the minority.

The Last of the Spirits
	  	,,

The young King was quite old enough to feel this insult. Dunstan had
been Treasurer in the last reign, and he soon charged Dunstan with
having taken some of the last king’s money. The Glastonbury Abbot fled
to Belgium (very narrowly escaping some pursuers who were sent to put
out his eyes, as you will wish they had, when you read what follows),
and his abbey was given to priests who were married; whom he always,
both before and afterwards, opposed. But he quickly conspired with his
friend, Odo the Dane, to set up the King’s young brother, Edgar, as his
rival for the throne; and, not content with this revenge, he caused the
beautiful queen Elgiva, though a lovely girl of only seventeen or
eighteen, to be stolen from one of the Royal Palaces, branded in the
cheek with a red-hot iron, and sold into slavery in Ireland. But the
Irish people pitied and befriended her; and they said, ‘Let us restore
the girl-queen to the boy-king, and make the young lovers happy!’ and
they cured her of her cruel wound, and sent her home as beautiful as
before. But the villain Dunstan, and that other villain, Odo, caused
her to be waylaid at Gloucester as she was joyfully hurrying to join
her husband, and to be hacked and hewn with swords, and to be
barbarously maimed and lamed, and left to die. When Edwy the Fair (his
people called him so, because he was so young and handsome) heard of
her dreadful fate, he died of a broken heart; and so the pitiful story
of the poor young wife and husband ends! Ah! Better to be two cottagers
in these better times, than king and queen of England in those bad
days, though never so fair!

‘Because,’ said Mrs Varden, ‘because I never interfere or interrupt;
because I never question where anybody comes or goes; because my whole
mind and soul is bent on saving where I can save, and labouring in this
house;--therefore, they try me as they do.’

‘Don’t go away, Mary,’ said the black-eyed man.

They returned to town without seeing anything more of their friend Mr.
Mackintosh, but being upon the very best terms with Mr. Joseph Clarke,
who--but for his really keeping his word and giving them a day's
sport--might be not unreasonably suspected of having been in league
with the landlord to use the sportsmen for their joint amusement, and
to extract a good dinner from them besides.

But what could I do? I could not deny Dora and my own heart. When he
told me I had better take a week to consider of what he had said, how
could I say I wouldn't take a week, yet how could I fail to know that no
amount of weeks could influence such love as mine?

To a collection of Sketches and Tales by a Working Man, published in
1844, {26} Charles Dickens was induced to contribute a preface, from
which we select the following passages:—

An open letter is the subject of the trooper’s speculations, and it
seems to perplex him mightily. He looks at it at arm’s length, brings
it close to him, holds it in his right hand, holds it in his left
hand, reads it with his head on this side, with his head on that
side, contracts his eyebrows, elevates them, still cannot satisfy
himself. He smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm, and
thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery, makes a halt before it
every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye. Even that won’t
do. “Is it,” Mr. George still muses, “blank cartridge or ball?”

This observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter.  As to Tom,
he was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is
usually at work on number one.  As to Mrs. Gradgrind, if she said
anything on the subject, she would come a little way out of her wrappers,
like a feminine dormouse, and say:

‘And you’ll find room for my little servant Agnes?’

‘Sniggle and Blink,’ cried the tenor.

‘Then you don’t care to know?’

‘D’ye think so?’ said Minns; and he tried another smile.

"I forgot," exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen. "It is my aunt."

"On the wings of the wind," replied the Ghost.

Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under
the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on
the grass on the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole
cautiously towards the house.

Seeing the great danger I was in, I had the presence of mind to answer,
"Never!"  To make it more final, I added, "Never!  Not from the cradle to
the grave."

I was completely bewildered between Mr. Spenlow and Mr. Jorkins, as to
which of them really was the objecting partner; but I saw with
sufficient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the firm, and
that the recovery of my aunt's thousand pounds was out of the question.
In a state of despondency, which I remember with anything but
satisfaction, for I know it still had too much reference to myself
(though always in connexion with Dora), I left the office, and went
homeward.

Mrs Wickam shook her left fore-finger stealthily towards the bed where
Florence lay; then turned it upside down, and made several emphatic
points at the floor; immediately below which was the parlour in which
Mrs Pipchin habitually consumed the toast.

"Yes, it is," says be.  "Thomas, beware of envy.  It is the green-eyed
monster which never did and never will improve each shining hour, but
quite the reverse.  I dread the envious man, Thomas.  I confess that I am
afraid of the envious man, when he is so envious as you are.  Whilst you
contemplated the works of a gifted rival, and whilst you heard that
rival's praises, and especially whilst you met his humble glance as he
put that card away, your countenance was so malevolent as to be terrific.
Thomas, I have heard of the envy of them that follows the Fine-Art line,
but I never believed it could be what yours is.  I wish you well, but I
take my leave of you.  And if you should ever got into trouble through
knifeing--or say, garotting--a brother artist, as I believe you will,
don't call me to character, Thomas, or I shall be forced to injure your
case."

‘Nonsense!’ returned Kit.  ‘She was well enough, I don’t deny that; but
think how she was dressed and painted, and what a difference that made.
Why YOU are a good deal better looking than her, Barbara.’

The troubles of the Micawbers increased more and more, until at last
they were obliged to leave London. I was very sad at this, for I had
been with them so long that I felt they were my friends, and the
prospect of being once more utterly alone and having to find a lodging
with strangers, made me so unhappy that I determined to endure this sort
of life no longer. The last Sunday the Micawbers were in town I dined
with them. I had bought a spotted horse for their little boy and a doll
for the little girl, and had saved up a shilling for the poor
servant-girl. After I had seen them off the next morning by the coach, I
wrote to Peggotty to ask her if she knew where my aunt, Miss Betsy
Trotwood, lived, and to borrow half-a-guinea; for I had resolved to run
away from Murdstone & Grinby's, and go to this aunt and tell her my
story. I remembered my mother telling me of her visit when I was a baby,
and that she fancied Miss Betsy had stroked her hair gently, and this
gave me courage to appeal to her. Peggotty wrote, enclosing the
half-guinea, and saying she only knew Miss Trotwood lived near Dover,
but whether in that place itself, or at Folkestone, Sandgate, or Hythe,
she could not tell. Hearing that all these places were close together, I
made up my mind to start. As I had received my week's wages in advance,
I waited till the following Saturday, thinking it would not be honest to
go before. I went out to look for someone to carry my box to the coach
office, and unfortunately hired a wicked young man who not only ran off
with the box, but robbed me of my half-guinea, leaving me in dire
distress. In despair, I started off to walk to Dover, and was forced to
sell my waistcoat to buy some bread. The first night I found my way to
my old school at Blackheath, and slept on a haystack close by, feeling
some comfort in the thought of the boys being near. I knew Steerforth
had left, or I would have tried to see him.

"Martha," said I then, leaning down, and helping her to rise--she seemed
to want to rise as if with the intention of going away, but she was
weak, and leaned against a boat. "Do you know who this is, who is with
me?"

She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her
work in her hands. Then she said, “Why not tell you the truth? I am
going to be married to him.”

"I have."

With which inquiry, Tim turned his back, and pretending to be absorbed
in his accounts, took an opportunity of hastily wiping his eyes when he
supposed Nicholas was looking another way.

The two Miss Pecksniffs murmured their approval of this wise
arrangement, and their cordial sympathy with its interesting object.

Mr. Wickfield, without rising, looked after him thoughtfully as he went
out. He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman, I thought, with
a handsome face, a rapid utterance, and a confident, bold air. And this
was the first I ever saw of Mr. Jack Maldon; whom I had not expected to
see so soon, when I heard the Doctor speak of him that morning.

‘I will make a point of seeing your wife directly.’

"So she is," said Mr. Pickwick, "so she is. What did you think of her
manners, from what you saw of her?"

‘Get along with you, old wretch!’ replied Mrs. Raddle, hastily
withdrawing the nightcap. ‘Old enough to be his grandfather, you willin!
You’re worse than any of ‘em.’

‘What reptile?’ said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him for fear he should
tread on some overgrown black beetle, or dropsical spider.

_Betsy._                  But so sweetly wild--

_Squire._ In rich and lofty station shine,
              Before his jealous eyes;
            In golden splendour, lady mine,
              This peasant youth despise.

‘What is due to this young lady,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘is Money, and this
young lady right well knows it.’

MY DEAR MACREADY,

The man's face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly,
and his eyes were blood-shot. The old woman's face was wrinkled, her two
remaining teeth protruded over her under lip, and her eyes were bright
and piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man,--they
seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.

"Gentlemen, my uncle walked on with his thumbs in his waistcoat
pockets, taking the middle of the street to himself, and singing, now
a verse of a love-song, and then a verse of a drinking one, and when
he was tired of both, whistling melodiously, until he reached the
North Bridge, which, at this point, connects the old and new towns
of Edinburgh. Here he stopped for a minute, to look at the strange
irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other, and twinkling
afar off so high, that they looked like stars, gleaming from the castle
walls on the one side and the Calton Hill on the other, as if they
illuminated veritable castles in the air; while the old picturesque
town slept heavily on, in gloom and darkness, below: its palace and
chapel of Holyrood, guarded day and night, as a friend of my uncle's
used to say, by old Arthur's Seat, towering, surly and dark, like some
gruff genius, over the ancient city he has watched so long. I say,
gentlemen, my uncle stopped here, for a minute, to look about him; and
then, paying a compliment to the weather, which had a little cleared
up, though the moon was sinking, walked on again, as royally as before;
keeping the middle of the road with great dignity, and looking as if
he would very much like to meet somebody who would dispute possession
of it with him. There was nobody at all disposed to contest the point,
as it happened; and so, on he went, with his thumbs in his waistcoat
pockets, like a lamb.

‘Yes, I think it is,’ resumed Mr. Magnus. ‘There’s a good name before
it, too, you will observe. Permit me, sir--if you hold the card a little
slanting, this way, you catch the light upon the up-stroke. There--Peter
Magnus--sounds well, I think, sir.’

The late Mr Waterton having, some time ago, expressed his opinion that
ravens are gradually becoming extinct in England, I offered the few
following words about my experience of these birds.

Mr. Danton was a young man of about five-and-twenty, with a
considerable stock of impudence, and a very small share of ideas: he
was a great favourite, especially with young ladies of from sixteen to
twenty-six years of age, both inclusive. He could imitate the
French-horn to admiration, sang comic songs most inimitably, and had
the most insinuating way of saying impertinent nothings to his doting
female admirers. He had acquired, somehow or other, the reputation of
being a great wit, and, accordingly, whenever he opened his mouth,
everybody who knew him laughed very heartily.

There is a bomb-proof fort here of great strength, which occupies a bold
position, and is capable, doubtless, of doing good service; though the
town is much too close upon the frontier to be long held, I should
imagine, for its present purpose in troubled times.  There is also a
small navy-yard, where a couple of Government steamboats were building,
and getting on vigorously.

One night it so happened that by some forgetfulness or mistake on the
part of the driver, the coach which usually came for him failed to
make its appearance. It was a very wet night, and not having a moment
to lose, he sent for another. After a considerable interval, during
which he was in an agony of fear lest the Covent Garden stage should
be kept waiting, the messenger returned in a breathless state with the
information that there was not a coach to be got. There was only one
desperate alternative, and that was to run through the streets. Knowing
that his appearance at Covent Garden must by this time be necessary, he
made up his mind to do it, and started off at once.

‘I don’t know,’ said Kit.

‘I am proud to no one. You mistake me,’ answered Dolly. ‘Fall back, if
you please, or go on.’

‘Capital luck,’ said the first, with a wink to his companion.

Although this hurried dialogue was carried on in a suppressed tone on
both sides, Ralph looked involuntarily round to ascertain that Kate had
not moved her position so as to be within hearing. His adversary saw the
advantage he had gained, and followed it up.

"Yes," returned Miss Dartle, "I have come to look at you. What? You are
not ashamed of the face that has done so much?"

CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE AND
MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW.

"He's the most dreadful child," said Mrs. Todgers, setting down the
dish, "I ever had to deal with. The gentlemen spoil him to that extent,
and teach him such things, that I'm afraid nothing but hanging will ever
do him any good."

The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was
unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and
violence, when the Jew came panting up.

“Well, Pip,” returned Joe, slowly considering. “What for?”

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight
of stairs, or through a bad young act of Parliament; but I mean to say
you might have got a hearse up that stair-case, and taken it broadwise,
with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the
balustrades, and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and
room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen
gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,
so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

“Lucretia!” said Mrs Chick “I will not attempt to disguise what I feel.
My eyes are opened, all at once. I wouldn’t have believed this, if a
Saint had told it to me.”

‘Deliver up our friends,’ said Hugh, ‘and you may keep the rest.’

‘Now then,’ said Ralph, composedly; ‘what’s in the wind, I ask again?
What is it?’

‘What are you doing?’ cried his master, catching him by both hands;
for he had made a show of kneeling at his feet. ‘Do not unfit me, dear
Gashford, for the solemn duty of this glorious day--’ the tears stood in
the eyes of the poor gentleman as he said the words.--‘Let us go
among them; we have to find a place in some division for this new
recruit--give me your hand.’

“It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
you.”

‘They can issue execution, my dear Sir, for the amount of the damages
and taxed costs, next term,’ replied Perker, ‘just two months hence, my
dear sir.’

The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had
returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver
had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom
Chitling, and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few
gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.

“And was he saved!” cried Florence. “Was he saved!”

‘My dear tutor,’ said I (now, really, without any nonsense), ‘to whom I
owe more obligations already than I ever can acknowledge--’

Mistaking my emotion, they were endeavouring to cheer me with the hope
that the boy would certainly be found,—great cheer that was for me!—when
we heard a low deep howl, and presently there sprung over the wall two
great dogs, who, bounding into the garden, repeated the baying sound we
had heard before.

"Work!" said the goblin, "what work?"

He patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep
voice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in
touching me--which it did.  I put it away as well as I could.  My mother
gently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her shawl,
turned to thank the gentleman for bringing her home.

“_I_ knows what I thinks,” observed the Jack.

‘Now don’t you be offended at what I’m a going to say,’ observed
Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. ‘You’ve had a long walk, you
know, or I wouldn’t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of
somethink, Mr. Bumble?’

His nephew lies asleep, calm and untroubled. John Jasper stands looking
down upon him, his unlighted pipe in his hand, for some time, with a
fixed and deep attention. Then, hushing his footsteps, he passes to his
own room, lights his pipe, and delivers himself to the Spectres it
invokes at midnight.

‘Mr. Harthouse,’ returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were
better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: ‘it’s too
late; the money is of no use to me at present.  I should have had it
before to be of use to me.  But I am very much obliged to you; you’re a
true friend.’

This made a great impression on my mind, and I really lived in this faith
until some years ago it happened upon a stormy night I was kindly
escorted from a bleak railway station to the little out-of-the-way town
it represented by a sprightly and vivacious newsman, to whom I
propounded, as we went along under my umbrella—he being most excellent
company—this old question, what was the one all-absorbing passion of the
human soul?  He replied, without the slightest hesitation, that it
certainly was the passion for getting your newspaper in advance of your
fellow-creatures; also, if you only hired it, to get it delivered at your
own door at exactly the same time as another man who hired the same copy
four miles off; and, finally, the invincible determination on the part of
both men not to believe the time was up when the boy called.

The elder Mr. Weller shook his head, as he replied with a sigh, "I've
done it once too often, Sammy; I've done it once too often. Take
example by your father, my boy, and be wery careful o' widders all
your life, specially if they've kept a public-house, Sammy." Having
delivered this parental advice with great pathos, Mr. Weller senior
re-filled his pipe from a tin box he carried in his pocket, and,
lighting his fresh pipe from the ashes of the old one, commenced
smoking at a great rate.

[Picture: Interior of the Guildhall, Court, circa 1830.  (From an
                     original drawing by T. Allen.)]

‘To tell you the truth,’ returned Mr Meagles, ‘it’s because I have an
addled jumble of a notion on that subject that you found me waiting
here. There is one of those odd impressions in my house, which do
mysteriously get into houses sometimes, which nobody seems to have
picked up in a distinct form from anybody, and yet which everybody seems
to have got hold of loosely from somebody and let go again, that she
lives, or was living, thereabouts.’ Mr Meagles handed him a slip of
paper, on which was written the name of one of the dull by-streets in
the Grosvenor region, near Park Lane.

He strode violently up and down the room and stopped again.

"Wery pleasant," rejoined Mr. Weller. "Wery pleasant and conformable."

“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sent
up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your
address. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of
business you mentioned to her. You’ll go down?”

“For what reason?”

This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked
somewhat sternly in Oliver’s face. It was impossible to doubt him;
there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.

With which mournful review of their proceedings, Mr Dennis sought
consolation in cold boiled beef and beer; but without at all relaxing
the grim and dissatisfied expression of his face, the gloom of which was
rather deepened than dissipated by their grateful influence.

‘A Friend has obtained his discharge, you can say if you please. A
Friend who hopes that for his sister’s sake, if for no one else’s, he
will make good use of his liberty.’

Nothing can be better than the rendering of the Fezziwig party, in Stave
Two.  You behold Scrooge gradually melting into humanity; Scrooge, as a
joyous apprentice; that model of employers, Fezziwig; Mrs. Fezziwig “one
vast substantial smile,” and all the Fezziwigs.  Mr. Dickens’s expression
as he relates how “in came the housemaid with _her cousin_ the baker, and
in came the cook _with her brother’s particular friend the milkman_,” is
delightfully comic, while his complete rendering of that dance where “all
were top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them,” is owing to
the inimitable action of his hands.  They actually perform upon the
table, as if it were the floor of Fezziwig’s room, and every finger were
a leg belonging to one of the Fezziwig’s family.  This feat is only
surpassed by Mr. Dickens’s illustration of Sir Roger de Coverley, as
interpreted by Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig, when “a positive light appeared to
issue from Fezziwig’s calves,” and he “cut so deftly that he appeared to
wink with his legs!”  It is a maze of humour.  Before the close of the
stave, Scrooge’s horror at sight of the young girl once loved by him, and
put aside for gold, shows that Mr. Dickens’s power is not purely comic.

Seen the Alderman?  Oh dear!  Who could ever help seeing the Alderman?
He was so considerate, so affable, he bore so much in mind the natural
desires of folks to see him, that if he had a fault, it was the being
constantly On View.  And wherever the great people were, there, to be
sure, attracted by the kindred sympathy between great souls, was Cute.

But at that moment a loud knocking was heard at the hall door.

At the hotel where Mr. Micawber had requested us to await him, which
we got into, with some trouble, in the middle of the night, I found a
letter, importing that he would appear in the morning punctually at half
past nine. After which, we went shivering, at that uncomfortable hour,
to our respective beds, through various close passages; which smelt as
if they had been steeped, for ages, in a solution of soup and stables.

St. James's, Sept. 4, 1714.
            SIR,--I have been obliged to so close an attendance
            on the Lords Justices, and have had so very little
            time at my own disposal during my absence from their
            excellencies, that I could not do myself the honour
            before now, to assure you of my respects, and to
            beg the continuance of that friendship which you
            formerly honoured me with, at Hanover.[73] I cannot
            but extremely rejoice at the occasion, which will give
            me on opportunity of waiting on you in England, where
            you will find a whole nation in the highest joy, and
            thoroughly sensible of the great blessings which they
            promise themselves from his Majesty's accession to the
            throne.

‘In life?’ asked Monks.

MY DEAR REGNIER,

‘I knew another man--let me see--forty years ago now--who took an old,
damp, rotten set of chambers, in one of the most ancient inns, that had
been shut up and empty for years and years before. There were lots of
old women’s stories about the place, and it certainly was very far from
being a cheerful one; but he was poor, and the rooms were cheap, and
that would have been quite a sufficient reason for him, if they had been
ten times worse than they really were. He was obliged to take some
mouldering fixtures that were on the place, and, among the rest, was a
great lumbering wooden press for papers, with large glass doors, and a
green curtain inside; a pretty useless thing for him, for he had no
papers to put in it; and as to his clothes, he carried them about with
him, and that wasn’t very hard work, either. Well, he had moved in all
his furniture--it wasn’t quite a truck-full--and had sprinkled it about
the room, so as to make the four chairs look as much like a dozen as
possible, and was sitting down before the fire at night, drinking the
first glass of two gallons of whisky he had ordered on credit, wondering
whether it would ever be paid for, and if so, in how many years’ time,
when his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press. “Ah,”
 says he, “if I hadn’t been obliged to take that ugly article at the old
broker’s valuation, I might have got something comfortable for the
money. I’ll tell you what it is, old fellow,” he said, speaking aloud to
the press, having nothing else to speak to, “if it wouldn’t cost more to
break up your old carcass, than it would ever be worth afterward, I’d
have a fire out of you in less than no time.” He had hardly spoken the
words, when a sound resembling a faint groan, appeared to issue from the
interior of the case. It startled him at first, but thinking, on a
moment’s reflection, that it must be some young fellow in the next
chamber, who had been dining out, he put his feet on the fender, and
raised the poker to stir the fire. At that moment, the sound was
repeated; and one of the glass doors slowly opening, disclosed a pale
and emaciated figure in soiled and worn apparel, standing erect in the
press. The figure was tall and thin, and the countenance expressive of
care and anxiety; but there was something in the hue of the skin, and
gaunt and unearthly appearance of the whole form, which no being of this
world was ever seen to wear. “Who are you?” said the new tenant, turning
very pale; poising the poker in his hand, however, and taking a very
decent aim at the countenance of the figure. “Who are you?” “Don’t throw
that poker at me,” replied the form; “if you hurled it with ever so sure
an aim, it would pass through me, without resistance, and expend its
force on the wood behind. I am a spirit.” “And pray, what do you want
here?” faltered the tenant. “In this room,” replied the apparition, “my
worldly ruin was worked, and I and my children beggared. In this press,
the papers in a long, long suit, which accumulated for years, were
deposited. In this room, when I had died of grief, and long-deferred
hope, two wily harpies divided the wealth for which I had contested
during a wretched existence, and of which, at last, not one farthing was
left for my unhappy descendants. I terrified them from the spot, and
since that day have prowled by night--the only period at which I can
revisit the earth--about the scenes of my long-protracted misery. This
apartment is mine: leave it to me.” “If you insist upon making your
appearance here,” said the tenant, who had had time to collect his
presence of mind during this prosy statement of the ghost’s, “I shall
give up possession with the greatest pleasure; but I should like to ask
you one question, if you will allow me.” “Say on,” said the apparition
sternly. “Well,” said the tenant, “I don’t apply the observation
personally to you, because it is equally applicable to most of the
ghosts I ever heard of; but it does appear to me somewhat inconsistent,
that when you have an opportunity of visiting the fairest spots of
earth--for I suppose space is nothing to you--you should always return
exactly to the very places where you have been most miserable.” “Egad,
that’s very true; I never thought of that before,” said the ghost. “You
see, Sir,” pursued the tenant, “this is a very uncomfortable room. From
the appearance of that press, I should be disposed to say that it is not
wholly free from bugs; and I really think you might find much more
comfortable quarters: to say nothing of the climate of London, which is
extremely disagreeable.” “You are very right, Sir,” said the ghost
politely, “it never struck me till now; I’ll try change of air
directly”--and, in fact, he began to vanish as he spoke; his legs,
indeed, had quite disappeared. “And if, Sir,” said the tenant, calling
after him, “if you _would _have the goodness to suggest to the other
ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses,
that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere, you will confer a
very great benefit on society.” “I will,” replied the ghost; “we must be
dull fellows--very dull fellows, indeed; I can’t imagine how we can have
been so stupid.” With these words, the spirit disappeared; and what is
rather remarkable,’ added the old man, with a shrewd look round the
table, ‘he never came back again.’

[Sidenote: Miss Hogarth.]

"A small matter," said the Ghost, "to make these silly
folks so full of gratitude."

‘What do you mean?’ said Wegg, quickly.

Although this custom has been abolished, and the cage is now boarded
up, the miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy persons
remains the same. We no longer suffer them to appeal at the prison
gates to the charity and compassion of the passers-by; but we still
leave unblotted in the leaves of our statute book, for the reverence
and admiration of succeeding ages, that just and wholesome law which
declares that the sturdy felon shall be fed and clothed, and that the
penniless debtor shall be left to die of starvation and nakedness.
This is no fiction. Not a week passes over our heads, but, in every
one of our prisons for debt, some of these men must inevitably expire
in the slow agonies of want, if they were not relieved by their
fellow-prisoners.

‘Mr. Pickwick’s servant!’ said Arabella earnestly.

The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.

The poor side of a debtor’s prison is, as its name imports, that in
which the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined. A
prisoner having declared upon the poor side, pays neither rent nor
chummage. His fees, upon entering and leaving the jail, are reduced in
amount, and he becomes entitled to a share of some small quantities of
food: to provide which, a few charitable persons have, from time to
time, left trifling legacies in their wills. Most of our readers will
remember, that, until within a very few years past, there was a kind of
iron cage in the wall of the Fleet Prison, within which was posted some
man of hungry looks, who, from time to time, rattled a money-box, and
exclaimed in a mournful voice, ‘Pray, remember the poor debtors; pray
remember the poor debtors.’ The receipts of this box, when there were
any, were divided among the poor prisoners; and the men on the poor side
relieved each other in this degrading office.

"Come from Heaven, soft balmy Sleep,
      Since thou art an angel there!
    Come, and watch around him keep--
      Watch that I with thee will share.

Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.

There was another Sunday, when an officer of the ship read the service.
It was quiet and impressive, until we fell upon the dangerous and
perfectly unnecessary experiment of striking up a hymn.  After it was
given out, we all rose, but everybody left it to somebody else to begin.
Silence resulting, the officer (no singer himself) rather reproachfully
gave us the first line again, upon which a rosy pippin of an old
gentleman, remarkable throughout the passage for his cheerful politeness,
gave a little stamp with his boot (as if he were leading off a country
dance), and blithely warbled us into a show of joining.  At the end of
the first verse we became, through these tactics, so much refreshed and
encouraged, that none of us, howsoever unmelodious, would submit to be
left out of the second verse; while as to the third we lifted up our
voices in a sacred howl that left it doubtful whether we were the more
boastful of the sentiments we united in professing, or of professing them
with a most discordant defiance of time and tune.

‘Oh! he has come into his property,’ answered Tom, nodding his head, and
smiling.

"No!  Nobody ever grew older after that."

‘Come along,’ shouted the old gentleman, addressing Mr. Winkle; ‘a keen
hand like you ought to have been up long ago, even to such poor work as
this.’

‘And what about the other fortnight?’ demanded Sikes. ‘What about
the other fortnight that you’ve left me lying here, like a sick rat
in his hole?’

THIS MAN. DO YOU CALL THIS CONSTITOOTIONAL! DO YOU SEE HIM SHOT THROUGH

WHICH PARTY TO SIDE WITH"--Chap. lxix.]

It not only appeared that the egotistical couple knew everybody, but
that scarcely any event of importance or notoriety had occurred for
many years with which they had not been in some way or other connected.
Thus we learned that when the well-known attempt upon the life of
George the Third was made by Hatfield in Drury Lane theatre, the
egotistical gentleman’s grandfather sat upon his right hand and was the
first man who collared him; and that the egotistical lady’s aunt,
sitting within a few boxes of the royal party, was the only person in
the audience who heard his Majesty exclaim, ‘Charlotte, Charlotte,
don’t be frightened, don’t be frightened; they’re letting off squibs,
they’re letting off squibs.’ When the fire broke out, which ended in
the destruction of the two Houses of Parliament, the egotistical
couple, being at the time at a drawing-room window on Blackheath, then
and there simultaneously exclaimed, to the astonishment of a whole
party—‘It’s the House of Lords!’ Nor was this a solitary instance of
their peculiar discernment, for chancing to be (as by a comparison of
dates and circumstances they afterwards found) in the same omnibus with
Mr. Greenacre, when he carried his victim’s head about town in a blue
bag, they both remarked a singular twitching in the muscles of his
countenance; and walking down Fish Street Hill, a few weeks since, the
egotistical gentleman said to his lady—slightly casting up his eyes to
the top of the Monument—‘There’s a boy up there, my dear, reading a
Bible. It’s very strange. I don’t like it.—In five seconds afterwards,
Sir,’ says the egotistical gentleman, bringing his hands together with
one violent clap—‘the lad was over!’

My mother starts, colours, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes out
of his chair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes my ears with it,
and turns me out of the room by the shoulders.

“Certainly not,” replied Duff.

“Nay, lad, but there is.” He did not speak again to contradict her;
indeed she did not know if he had heard her, so unmoved did he look.

"Copperfield," said Traddles, turning to me, "you feel, I am sure, that
nothing could be more reasonable or considerate."

I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition
with my creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and I
went out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, and
within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four
months I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across
the parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under
old Bill Barley’s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to
marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until
he brought her back.

“And as I know—it’s what I always said—that Wal”r’s in a way to make
his fortune,” said the Captain.

‘No, I am not your darling. Because you must be sorry that you married
me, or else you wouldn’t reason with me!’ returned Dora.

‘How do you do sir?’ said Martin.

‘“Feel myself ashamed and completely circumscribed in a-dressin’ of you,
for you are a nice gal and nothin’ but it.”’

"Ah, she's poorly," said the first old woman. "It's one of her bad days.
If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe she'd
go out too, and never come to life again."

But, he had not gone the length of three streets, when he saw another of
the shawled figures in advance of him, at which he looked so keenly that
perhaps its mere shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavement—if he
could have seen it without the figure itself moving along from lamp to
lamp, brightening and fading as it went—would have been enough to tell
him who was there.  Making his pace at once much quicker and much softer,
he darted on until he was very near this figure, then fell into his
former walk, and called ‘Rachael!’

‘That’s well,’ said the doctor. ‘Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr.
Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so
hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small
commission in your favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will
you?’

“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had
listened for a while.

“The what?” exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.

Mr Pecksniff, not at all knowing what it might be best to say in the
momentary pause which ensued upon these remarks, made an elaborate
demonstration of intending to deliver something very oracular indeed;
trusting to the certainty of the old man interrupting him, before he
should utter a word. Nor was he mistaken, for Martin Chuzzlewit having
taken breath, went on to say:

Mechanically I turned round the miniature to examine the back of
it, and on the back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the
pentacle a ladder, and the third step of the ladder was formed by
the date 1765.  Examining still more minutely, I detected a spring;
this, on being pressed, opened the back of the miniature as a lid.
Within-side the lid were engraved, "Marianna to thee.  Be faithful
in life and in death to ----."  Here follows a name that I will not
mention, but it was not unfamiliar to me.  I had heard it spoken of
by old men in my childhood as the name borne by a dazzling
charlatan who had made a great sensation in London for a year or
so, and had fled the country on the charge of a double murder
within his own house,--that of his mistress and his rival.  I said
nothing of this to Mr. J----, to whom reluctantly I resigned the
miniature.

"Yes," said the captain, still looking at the fire, "I make up stories
and tell 'em to that child.  Stories of shipwreck on desert islands, and
long delay in getting back to civilised lauds.  It is to stories the like
of that, mostly, that

“Somebody must go,” said Mr Dombey, “and you are young and healthy, and
your Uncle’s circumstances are not good. Tell your Uncle that you are
appointed. You will not go yet. There will be an interval of a month—or
two perhaps.”

‘No doubt,’ said Fanny. ‘But you can’t separate her from her husband, I
believe, without an Act of Parliament.’

‘There are various degrees and kinds of blindness, widow. There is the
connubial blindness, ma’am, which perhaps you may have observed in
the course of your own experience, and which is a kind of wilful and
self-bandaging blindness. There is the blindness of party, ma’am, and
public men, which is the blindness of a mad bull in the midst of a
regiment of soldiers clothed in red. There is the blind confidence of
youth, which is the blindness of young kittens, whose eyes have not yet
opened on the world; and there is that physical blindness, ma’am, of
which I am, contrairy to my own desire, a most illustrious example.
Added to these, ma’am, is that blindness of the intellect, of which we
have a specimen in your interesting son, and which, having sometimes
glimmerings and dawnings of the light, is scarcely to be trusted as a
total darkness. Therefore, ma’am, I have taken the liberty to get him
out of the way for a short time, while you and I confer together, and
this precaution arising out of the delicacy of my sentiments towards
yourself, you will excuse me, ma’am, I know.’

33–37 EAST SEVENTEENTH STREET (UNION SQUARE NORTH)

Rigaud took his cigarette from his mouth, and eyed him with a momentary
revelation of surprise. But he put it between his lips again, as he
answered with coolness:

“Where--how was it done?” I cried.

“Let the birds be, will you, Misses Brown?” retorted Rob, in a tone of
the acutest anguish. “I think a cove had better have to do with lions
than them little creeturs, for they’re always flying back in your face
when you least expect it. Well, how d’ye do and what do you want?”
These polite inquiries the Grinder uttered, as it were under protest,
and with great exasperation and vindictiveness.

‘I say,’ growled Mr. Barkis, ‘it was all right.’

“Yes, ma’am, a deal better; but where am I, and who is it with me?”

‘Oh, she’s pretty well,’ said Poll. ‘She’s at home.’

“Your servant, sir,” says Mr. George with a military salute.
Good-humouredly smiling all over his broad forehead up into his crisp
hair, he then defers to Miss Flite, as, with great stateliness, and
at some length, she performs the courtly ceremony of presentation. He
winds it up with another “Your servant, sir!” and another salute.

“Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching
Hell-babe,” cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the
boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. “That door. Quick!” He
flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. “Is the downstairs door
fast?”

This unforeseen occurrence threw both literally and figuratively a damp
upon the performances which there was no recovering. From that time,
with the single exception of one evening, the theatre was deserted.
Tarpaulings, and all kinds of cheap remedies, were tried, but they all
failed in producing their intended effect. They never kept the water
out, or drew the company in. As to any thorough repair of the roof, it
was wholly out of the question; for the Dibdins only held the theatre
until March, and the necessary repairs under this head alone would have
cost at the very least 200_l._

They bade him good-bye very many times, and turned away, walking slowly
and often looking back, until they could see him no more.  At length
they left the village far behind, and even lost sight of the smoke above
the trees.  They walked onward now at a quicker pace, keeping to the
main road, meaning to go wherever it might lead them.

The lamplighter now dotting the quiet Close with specks of light, and
running at a great rate up and down his little ladder with that
object—his little ladder under the sacred shadow of whose inconvenience
generations had grown up, and which all Cloisterham would have stood
aghast at the idea of abolishing—the Dean withdraws to his dinner, Mr.
Tope to his tea, and Mr. Jasper to his piano. There, with no light but
that of the fire, he sits chanting choir-music in a low and beautiful
voice, for two or three hours; in short, until it has been for some
time dark, and the moon is about to rise.

"What can I do?" returned the little woman, standing up, and holding out
her arms to show herself. "See! What I am, my father was; and my sister
is; and my brother is. I have worked for sister and brother these many
years--hard, Mr. Copperfield--all day. I must live. I do no harm. If
there are people so unreflecting or so cruel, as to make a jest of me,
what is left for me to do but to make a jest of myself, them, and every
thing? If I do so, for the time, whose fault is that? Mine?"

‘Never mind,’ said Mr Codlin, with the air of a discontented
philosopher.  ‘I know better now, and p’raps I’m sorry for it.’

However, here was a model before him. He hesitated no longer.
Addressing Mr. Grewgious, as one placed in authority by the revelation
he had brought to bear on the mystery (and surpassingly Angular Mr.
Grewgious became when he found himself in that unexpected position),
Mr. Crisparkle bore his testimony to Mr. Jasper’s strict sense of
justice, and, expressing his absolute confidence in the complete
clearance of his pupil from the least taint of suspicion, sooner or
later, avowed that his confidence in that young gentleman had been
formed, in spite of his confidential knowledge that his temper was of
the hottest and fiercest, and that it was directly incensed against Mr.
Jasper’s nephew, by the circumstance of his romantically supposing
himself to be enamoured of the same young lady. The sanguine reaction
manifest in Mr. Jasper was proof even against this unlooked-for
declaration. It turned him paler; but he repeated that he would cling
to the hope he had derived from Mr. Grewgious; and that if no trace of
his dear boy were found, leading to the dreadful inference that he had
been made away with, he would cherish unto the last stretch of
possibility the idea, that he might have absconded of his own wild
will.

He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing
was visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which
she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay
nearly under there. _He_ knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon
the very spot!

"The man had moved into a sitting posture. His body was much bent, and
his face was wrinkled and yellow. His dress denoted him an inmate of
the workhouse: he had the appearance of being very old, but it looked
more the effect of dissipation or disease, than length of years. He was
staring hard at the stranger, and though his eyes were lustreless and
heavy at first, they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed
expression after they had been fixed upon him for a short time, until
they seemed to be staring from their sockets. Edmunds gradually raised
himself to his knees, and looked more and more earnestly upon the old
man's face. They gazed upon each other in silence.

"Oh," said Mr. Pickwick, "I see. Yes; very curious life. Very
uncomfortable."

It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of
the matron’s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with
palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the
grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature’s
hand.

She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said
good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look
with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.

Father Fothergill was busy in the refectory trying conclusions with a
venison pasty, when he received the summons of his patron to attend him
in the chapel cemetery. Of course he lost no time in obeying it, for
obedience was the general rule in Shurland Castle. If anybody ever said
"I won't," it was the exception; and, like all other exceptions, only
proved the rule the stronger. The Father was a friar of the Augustine
persuasion; a brotherhood which, having been planted in Kent some few
centuries earlier, had taken very kindly to the soil, and overspread
the county much as hops did some few centuries later. He was plump and
portly, a little thick-winded, especially after dinner, stood five
feet four in his sandals, and weighed hard upon eighteen stone. He was
moreover a personage of singular piety; and the iron girdle, which, he
said, he wore under his cassock to mortify withal, might have been well
mistaken for the tire of a cart-wheel. When he arrived, Sir Ralph was
pacing up and down by the side of a newly-opened grave.

“Mr. Dickens alluded playfully to this item of intelligence; said he was
exceedingly happy to hear it, as he trusted now that a suit, in which he
was greatly interested, would speedily come to an end.  I heard a little
by-conversation between Mr. Dickens and a gentleman of the bar, who sat
opposite me, in which the latter seemed to be reiterating the same
assertions, and I understood him to say, that a case not extraordinarily
complicated might be got through with in three months.  Mr. Dickens said
he was very happy to hear it; but I fancied there was a little shade of
incredulity in his manner; however, the incident showed one thing, that
is, that the chancery were not insensible to the representations of
Dickens; but the whole tone of the thing was quite good-natured and
agreeable.” {113}

"Mr. Obenreizer," returned Vendale, somewhat out of countenance, "I was
but a silly young fellow, just of age, when I first had the pleasure of
travelling with you, and when you and I and Mademoiselle your niece--who
is well?"

“This is our friend’s consulting-room (or would be, if he ever
prescribed), his sanctum, his studio,” said my guardian to us.

"No, that I wouldn't," said Mr. Pell; and he pursed up his lips,
frowned, and shook his head mysteriously.

My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point; but to facilitate matters
I said I would gladly remain behind, if they pleased; and returned into
Mr. Wickfield’s office, where I sat down again, in the chair I had first
occupied, to await their return.

‘When I says I will, I means I will,’ replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.

TO THE EDITOR OF BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY.

In this state of affairs her father was brought home suffering and ill,
and gloomily retired to his own rooms, where he was tended by servants,
not approached by his wife, and had no friend or companion but Mr.
Carker, who always withdrew near midnight.

‘Perhaps I am, ma’am. Perhaps I am,’ sighed the first-floor lodger.

“Well! I’ve heerd that complaint of it once or twice before,” replied
the trader; “but it soon cools down again; don’t you find it so?”

"Good afternoon," said Scrooge.

“Yes, yes. To-morrow,” said the old man. “Think of me to-morrow. Say
to-morrow.”

We had our eye on Mr. Balim at dinner-time, and perceived that he
flourished wonderfully, being still surrounded by a little group of young
ladies, who listened to him as an oracle, while he ate from their plates
and drank from their glasses in a manner truly captivating from its
excessive playfulness.  His conversation, too, was exceedingly brilliant.
In fact, one elderly lady assured us, that in the course of a little
lively _badinage_ on the subject of ladies’ dresses, he had evinced as
much knowledge as if he had been born and bred a milliner.

What diamonds? what robbery? what was this mystery?  That will
never be ascertained, for the wretched man's demeanor instantly
changed.  "Certainly, sir;--oh, certainly," he said, forcing a
grin.  "How will you have the money, sir?  All right, Mr. Abednego.
This way out."

A dream of their coming in with Dora; of the pew-opener arranging us,
like a drill-sergeant, before the altar rails; of my wondering, even
then, why pew-openers must always be the most disagreeable females
procurable, and whether there is any religious dread of a disastrous
infection of good-humour which renders it indispensable to set those
vessels of vinegar upon the road to Heaven.

"You must have perceived, sir," began my young friend, "that I am of
a wayward temper, and have been spoiled by overweening indulgence. My
father--but he is in the grave; let me not disturb his ashes more than
necessary;--I told you he had died of a broken heart. I am ashamed of
the prevarication; his heart certainly was broken, but _his own hand_
assisted the slower operations of nature. He would not brook delay; so
ran a sword into that princely organ, and made it stop."

But the wintry morning wants him not and wakes him not. It wakes Mr.
George of the shooting gallery and his familiar. They arise, roll up
and stow away their mattresses. Mr. George, having shaved himself
before a looking-glass of minute proportions, then marches out,
bare-headed and bare-chested, to the pump in the little yard and anon
comes back shining with yellow soap, friction, drifting rain, and
exceedingly cold water. As he rubs himself upon a large jack-towel,
blowing like a military sort of diver just come up, his hair curling
tighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more he rubs it so
that it looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive
instrument than an iron rake or a curry-comb—as he rubs, and puffs,
and polishes, and blows, turning his head from side to side the more
conveniently to excoriate his throat, and standing with his body well
bent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs, Phil, on his
knees lighting a fire, looks round as if it were enough washing for
him to see all that done, and sufficient renovation for one day to
take in the superfluous health his master throws off.

The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at
the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers; for the noise
of a wooden body falling violently was heard, and then an indistinct
muttering, as of a man between asleep and awake.

‘I want to know--’

“Living on—?”

In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all
persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to
jail. This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of
those villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand
about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a
proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady’s ordering one of
the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of
the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he
begged at a farmer’s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the
dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about
the beadle—which brought Oliver’s heart into his mouth,—very often the
only thing he had there, for many hours together.

‘What are you going to do with Little Dorrit? Is she to come to work
here for ever? To come to tea here for ever? To come backwards and
forwards here, in the same way, for ever?’

"Ah!" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward
on her crossed arms. "Bed-curtains!"

"Thankee. Thankee, very kind, sir. One thing furder. I'm in good employ,
you know, Mas'r Davy, and I han't no way now of spending what I gets.
Money's of no use to me no more, except to live. If you can lay it out
for him, I shall do my work with a better art. Though as to that, sir,"
and he spoke very steadily and mildly, "you're not to think but I shall
work at all times, like a man, and act the best that lays in my power!"

_Pickwick._

“Reading?” repeats Edwin Drood, with a touch of contempt. “No. Doing,
working, engineering. My small patrimony was left a part of the capital
of the Firm I am with, by my father, a former partner; and I am a
charge upon the Firm until I come of age; and then I step into my
modest share in the concern. Jack—you met him at dinner—is, until then,
my guardian and trustee.”

“Never.”

What strange creatures we are! The slight bait so skilfully thrown out
by Ralph, on their first interview, was dangling on the hook yet. At
every small deprivation or discomfort which presented itself in the
course of the four-and-twenty hours to remind her of her straitened
and altered circumstances, peevish visions of her dower of one thousand
pounds had arisen before Mrs. Nickleby’s mind, until, at last, she had
come to persuade herself that of all her late husband’s creditors she
was the worst used and the most to be pitied. And yet, she had loved him
dearly for many years, and had no greater share of selfishness than is
the usual lot of mortals. Such is the irritability of sudden poverty. A
decent annuity would have restored her thoughts to their old train, at
once.

The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.
The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few
and simple words.

“Berry’s very fond of you, ain’t she?” Paul once asked Mrs Pipchin when
they were sitting by the fire with the cat.

“I hope he does,” says Tony. “But I doubt it.”

As I remember, it was almost midnight when we took our leave. We had had
some biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth had produced from
his pocket a full flask of Hollands, which we men (I may say we men,
now, without a blush) had emptied. We parted merrily; and as they all
stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our
road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em'ly peeping after us, from
behind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we
went.

‘Not his niece’s husband,’ interposed the stranger, ‘I’ll be sworn; for
he was there before you.’

The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his
hardest speed.

“You will not?” said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this
answer.

‘Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know.  ’Tis better that we make up our minds
to be open wi’ one another.’

The child handed him a letter. Mr Quilp, without changing his position
further than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin
on his hand, proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents.

As to Mr Feeder, B.A., Doctor Blimber’s assistant, he was a kind of
human barrel-organ, with a little list of tunes at which he was
continually working, over and over again, without any variation. He
might have been fitted up with a change of barrels, perhaps, in early
life, if his destiny had been favourable; but it had not been; and he
had only one, with which, in a monotonous round, it was his occupation
to bewilder the young ideas of Doctor Blimber’s young gentlemen. The
young gentlemen were prematurely full of carking anxieties. They knew
no rest from the pursuit of stony-hearted verbs, savage
noun-substantives, inflexible syntactic passages, and ghosts of
exercises that appeared to them in their dreams. Under the forcing
system, a young gentleman usually took leave of his spirits in three
weeks. He had all the cares of the world on his head in three months.
He conceived bitter sentiments against his parents or guardians in
four; he was an old misanthrope, in five; envied Curtius that blessed
refuge in the earth, in six; and at the end of the first twelvemonth
had arrived at the conclusion, from which he never afterwards departed,
that all the fancies of the poets, and lessons of the sages, were a
mere collection of words and grammar, and had no other meaning in the
world.

"He calls the knaves, Jacks, this boy!" said Estella with disdain,
before our first game was out.  "And what coarse hands he has!  And what
thick boots!"

I noticed, I remember, as he paused, looking at me with his handsome
head a little thrown back, and his glass raised in his hand, that,
though the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face, and it was ruddy,
there were traces in it, made since I last saw it, as if he had applied
himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which, when
roused, was so passionately roused within him. I had it in my thoughts
to remonstrate with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy
that he took--such as this buffeting of rough seas, and braving of hard
weather, for example--when my mind glanced off to the immediate subject
of our conversation again, and pursued that instead.

“Why, good gracious, gentlemen,” says Mr. Snagsby, somewhat promptly
backed away, “I was at this door last night betwixt ten and eleven
o’clock in conversation with the young man who lodges here.”

Poor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy
unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very
day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material
influence over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was
it:

_Sestet and Chorus._
    Turn him from the farm,                                 15

As the little man put his now empty glass to his lips, when he made this
reflection, I proposed to him to have it refilled, and I would keep him
company with another. ‘Well, sir,’ he returned, in his slow way, ‘it’s
more than I am accustomed to; but I can’t deny myself the pleasure
of your conversation. It seems but yesterday that I had the honour of
attending you in the measles. You came through them charmingly, sir!’

“When I speak of Sir Leicester being the sole consideration, he and
the family credit are one. Sir Leicester and the baronetcy, Sir
Leicester and Chesney Wold, Sir Leicester and his ancestors and his
patrimony”—Mr. Tulkinghorn very dry here—“are, I need not say to
you, Lady Dedlock, inseparable.”

I have considered your questions, and here follow my replies.

_Spir._ Come in, and know me better, man. You have never seen the like
of me before.

I was excessively anxious to get Mr. Micawber away; and replied, with my
hat in my hand, and a very red face I have no doubt, that I was a pupil
at Doctor Strong's.

It may be necessary to observe, lest there should appear any
incongruity in the close of this soliloquy, that Mr Swiveller did not
wind up with a cheerful hilarious laugh, which would have been
undoubtedly at variance with his solemn reflections, but that, being in
a theatrical mood, he merely achieved that performance which is
designated in melodramas ‘laughing like a fiend,’--for it seems that
your fiends always laugh in syllables, and always in three syllables,
never more nor less, which is a remarkable property in such gentry, and
one worthy of remembrance.

It stands in a snug corner, midway between the fireside and a low arched
door leading to my bedroom.  Its fame is diffused so extensively
throughout the neighbourhood, that I have often the satisfaction of
hearing the publican, or the baker, and sometimes even the parish-clerk,
petitioning my housekeeper (of whom I shall have much to say by-and-by)
to inform him the exact time by Master Humphrey’s clock.  My barber, to
whom I have referred, would sooner believe it than the sun.  Nor are
these its only distinctions.  It has acquired, I am happy to say,
another, inseparably connecting it not only with my enjoyments and
reflections, but with those of other men; as I shall now relate.

“No, sir! No!”

[Sidenote: Mrs. Gaskell.]

But, as the night advanced, the clouds closing in and densely
overspreading the whole sky, then very dark, it came on to blow, harder
and harder. It still increased, until our horses could scarcely face the
wind. Many times, in the dark part of the night (it was then late in
September, when the nights were not short), the leaders turned about, or
came to a dead stop; and we were often in serious apprehension that the
coach would be blown over. Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this
storm, like showers of steel; and, at those times, when there was any
shelter of trees or lee walls to be got, we were fain to stop, in a
sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle.

‘I have been travelling day and night, and am tired. I have lost some
money, and that don’t improve me. Put my supper in the little off-room
below, and have the truckle-bed made. I shall sleep there to-night, and
maybe to-morrow night; and if I can sleep all day to-morrow, so much
the better, for I’ve got trouble to sleep off, if I can. Keep the house
quiet, and don’t call me. Mind! Don’t call me. Don’t let anybody call
me. Let me lie there.’

This was nothing less than the sudden pouring forth of a rapid
succession of the shrillest and most piercing screams, from an upper
story; and to all appearance from the very two-pair back, in which
the infant Kenwigs was at that moment enshrined. They were no sooner
audible, than Mrs. Kenwigs, opining that a strange cat had come in, and
sucked the baby’s breath while the girl was asleep, made for the door,
wringing her hands, and shrieking dismally; to the great consternation
and confusion of the company.

We went early and posted ourself in an eligible part of the
drawing-room, from whence we could hope to obtain a full view of the
interesting animal. Two or three hours passed, the quadrilles began,
the room filled; but no lion appeared. The lady of the house became
inconsolable,--for it is one of the peculiar privileges of these lions
to make solemn appointments and never keep them,--when all of a sudden
there came a tremendous double rap at the street-door, and the master
of the house, after gliding out (unobserved as he flattered himself) to
peep over the banisters, came into the room, rubbing his hands together
with great glee, and cried out in a very important voice, "My dear,
Mr. ---- (naming the lion) has this moment arrived."

"Well, well," said Mr. Pickwick, who had been bestowing a score or two
of frowns upon Perker, to stop his summary of benefits conferred, which
the little attorney obstinately disregarded, "you must be careful not
to play any more desperate cricket matches, Mr. Jingle, or to renew
your acquaintance with Sir Thomas Blazo, and I have little doubt of
your preserving your health."

‘Bolter,’ said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself
opposite Morris Bolter.

“Willingly.

‘Her name?’

Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new
clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the
dark, and locking the door behind him.

“Dame Trot,” said he, receiving me with a kiss, “welcome to the
growlery again, my dear. I have a scheme to develop, little woman. I
propose to remain here, perhaps for six months, perhaps for a longer
time—as it may be. Quite to settle here for a while, in short.”

‘Three serious footmen,’ replied Tom. ‘“Cook, housemaid, and nursemaid;
each female servant required to join the Little Bethel Congregation
three times every Sunday--with a serious footman. If the cook is more
serious than the footman, she will be expected to improve the footman;
if the footman is more serious than the cook, he will be expected to
improve the cook.”’

Many a time, when to my garret,
Weary, I returned at night,
It has seemed to look a welcome
That has made my poor room bright.

The little town of Great Winglebury is exactly forty-two miles and
three-quarters from Hyde Park corner. It has a long, straggling, quiet
High-street, with a great black and white clock at a small red
Town-hall, half-way up—a market-place—a cage—an assembly-room—a
church—a bridge—a chapel—a theatre—a library—an inn—a pump—and a
Post-office. Tradition tells of a ‘Little Winglebury,’ down some
cross-road about two miles off; and, as a square mass of dirty paper,
supposed to have been originally intended for a letter, with certain
tremulous characters inscribed thereon, in which a lively imagination
might trace a remote resemblance to the word ‘Little,’ was once stuck
up to be owned in the sunny window of the Great Winglebury Post-office,
from which it only disappeared when it fell to pieces with dust and
extreme old age, there would appear to be some foundation for the
legend. Common belief is inclined to bestow the name upon a little hole
at the end of a muddy lane about a couple of miles long, colonised by
one wheelwright, four paupers, and a beer-shop; but, even this
authority, slight as it is, must be regarded with extreme suspicion,
inasmuch as the inhabitants of the hole aforesaid, concur in opining
that it never had any name at all, from the earliest ages down to the
present day.

‘Master. He wants to know whether you’re at home.’

‘Ay?’ cried the locksmith. ‘What’s that?’

‘You have not turned saving, at this time of day, I hope?’ said Crowl.

"Why, what's this?" cried the captain, when at last he broke the silence.
"You two are alike.  You two are much alike.  What's this?"

"Thanks to _me_!" interposed Guguste.

What the Psalmist said in sorrow, those who witnessed the career of the
Honorable Ensign Spoonbill and his companions might have said, not in
sorrow only but in anger: “One day told another, and one night certified
another.”

The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,
and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like
a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But
this the Spirit said could not be done.

"Why, really there ain't much time to lose," replied Jackson; "and I've
got a friend here," he continued, looking towards the man with the ash
stick.

Lounging near the doors, and in remote corners, were various knots
of silly young men, displaying various varieties of puppyism and
stupidity; amusing all sensible people near them with their folly
and conceit; and happily thinking themselves the objects of general
admiration. A wise and merciful dispensation which no good man will
quarrel with.

Doctor Speddie politely assented to the proposition of Francis Goodchild,
‘as it would give him the pleasure of enjoying a few more minutes of Mr.
Goodchild’s society than he could otherwise have hoped for,’ and they
went out together into the village street.  The rain had nearly ceased,
the clouds had broken before a cool wind from the north-east, and stars
were shining from the peaceful heights beyond them.

_It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the
    red-nosed man writhing in Mr. Weller's grasp_            "     386

_Nicholas Nickleby._

Thus he begins after a long silence, when Sophronia flashes fiercely,
and turns upon him.

It is no worse, because I write of it. It would be no better, if I
stopped my most unwilling hand. It is done. Nothing can undo it; nothing
can make it otherwise than as it was.

‘Oh that, indeed, Nicholas, my dear,’ returned Mrs. Nickleby, ‘that’s
another thing. If you put it upon that ground, why, of course, I have
no more to say, than that I have no doubt they are very good sort of
persons, and that I have no kind of objection to their coming here to
tea if they like, and shall make a point of being very civil to them if
they do.’

I made a low bow, but said nothing, seeing that my mistress thought
more of the fowl than of me; such is the way of the world, and those
who will win women must endure to have their pride occasionally
mortified. The old lady, however, covered me with compliments; she
was delighted to make my acquaintance; her niece had told her what an
amiable and gentlemanlike young man I was. I could observe, while the
aunt was hard at work overloading me with compliments, that Carolina
was taking a sly peep at the bulk of my pockets, and wondering what
kind of commodity it was that produced so misplaced a swelling on so
well-formed a young man as I flatter myself no one can deny I am; but,
just at this moment, the bevy of hungry curs at the door set up such a
howl in concert, that my angel was fain to cram her handkerchief into
her mouth to conceal her laughing, and I thought the old dame would go
into a fit, so violent was her merriment. Finding the case going thus
hard against me, I determined to strike a bold stroke for conquest; so,
slipping out my penknife, I slit up the pocket where the treasure lay,
and down fell the leg of lamb in all its natural beauty on the floor.
I thought the aunt would have fainted with delight, such an unexpected
vision of glory dazzled her understanding and her sight. The _bouquet_
of the meat was, I suppose, conveyed through the keyhole to the canine
multitude that still lined the stairs, and another universal howl
proclaimed their despair that it was beyond their reach.

‘I can’t see anything but the curtain of the bed,’ said Brass, applying
his eye to the keyhole of the door.  ‘Is he a strong man, Mr Richard?’

‘To night’s work was a part of our bargain,’ replied Montague; ‘and so
was this.’

"If he is alive--I know it is my lover--he will be dead before you can
return.  Dear Guides!  Blessed friends of travellers!  Look at me.  Watch
my hands.  If they falter or go wrong, make me your prisoner by force.  If
they are steady and go right, help me to save him!"

He took no notice, but stood looking down, as if he had not heard the
words. There was a very dark expression on his face; an expression
that the Rogue found it hard to understand. It was fierce, and full
of purpose; but the purpose might have been as much against himself as
against another. If he had stepped back for a spring, taken a leap, and
thrown himself in, it would have been no surprising sequel to the look.
Perhaps his troubled soul, set upon some violence, did hover for the
moment between that violence and another.

‘Her grief,’ replied Traddles, with a serious look. ‘Her feelings
generally. As I mentioned on a former occasion, she is a very superior
woman, but has lost the use of her limbs. Whatever occurs to harass
her, usually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted to the
chest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded the whole system
in a most alarming manner. However, they brought her through it by
unremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday
six weeks. You have no idea what a Monster I felt, Copperfield, when I
saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction! Mrs.
Crewler couldn’t see me before we left--couldn’t forgive me, then, for
depriving her of her child--but she is a good creature, and has done so
since. I had a delightful letter from her, only this morning.’

Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.

‘I should think so,’ said Mrs Todgers.

I wondered peevishly why they couldn’t put her anywhere else instead
of quartering her on me. To get rid of her, I undressed quickly,
extinguished my light, and went to bed. But, as I fell asleep, I could
not forget that she was still there looking, ‘Is it really, though?
I want to know’; and when I awoke in the night, I found that I was
uneasily asking all sorts of people in my dreams whether it really was
or not--without knowing what I meant.

“When is it to be done?” asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent
exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with
which he received Fagin’s affectation of humanity.

"Instantly, sir," said the lady.

‘My tea is drawing, and my muffin is on the hob, Mr Wegg; will you
partake?’

‘It’s my father, my dear,’ said Mr. Weller, turning with an explanatory
air to the young lady in the bar; ‘blessed if I think he hardly knows
wot my other name is. Well, young brockiley sprout, wot then?’

With those farewell words to comfort him Wilding set forth on the journey
of investigation which began from the Foundling doors.  The first stage
to make for, was plainly the house of business of the bankers in Lombard
Street.  Two of the partners in the firm were inaccessible to
chance-visitors when he asked for them.  The third, after raising certain
inevitable difficulties, consented to let a clerk examine the ledger
marked with the initial letter "M."  The account of Mrs. Miller, widow,
of Groombridge Wells, was found.  Two long lines, in faded ink, were
drawn across it; and at the bottom of the page there appeared this note:
"Account closed, September 30th, 1837."

‘Of course, Lavinia will be a parlour boarder,’ continued the enviable
father; ‘and on one point I wish my directions to be strictly observed.
The fact is, that some ridiculous love affair, with a person much her
inferior in life, has been the cause of her present state of mind.
Knowing that of course, under your care, she can have no opportunity of
meeting this person, I do not object to—indeed, I should rather
prefer—her mixing with such society as you see yourself.’

Fogg said they thought it rather probable.  Dodson smiled, and said
    they'd try.

“Goodness knows,” exclaimed Miss Nipper, “there’s a many we could spare
instead, if numbers is a object, Mrs Pipchin as a overseer would come
cheap at her weight in gold, and if a knowledge of black slavery should
be required, them Blimbers is the very people for the sitiwation.”

‘Von Koeldwethout never saw it again. Having once made up his mind
to action, he soon brought the baroness and the Von Swillenhausens to
reason, and died many years afterwards: not a rich man that I am aware
of, but certainly a happy one: leaving behind him a numerous family,
who had been carefully educated in bear and boar-hunting under his own
personal eye. And my advice to all men is, that if ever they become
hipped and melancholy from similar causes (as very many men do), they
look at both sides of the question, applying a magnifying-glass to the
best one; and if they still feel tempted to retire without leave, that
they smoke a large pipe and drink a full bottle first, and profit by the
laudable example of the Baron of Grogzwig.’

The scene was Mr. Cruncher’s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)

“O, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned. “I don’t think it would
answer.”

"Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?" said Sowerberry, giving
Oliver a shake and a box on the ear.

At the close of this declaration, which Sam made with great emotion, the
elder Mr. Weller rose from his chair, and, forgetting all considerations
of time, place, or propriety, waved his hat above his head, and gave
three vehement cheers.

The old lady made no reply to this, but wiping her eyes first, and her
spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were
part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver
to drink, and then patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very
quiet, or he would be ill again.

How far he had followed out of the gallery, or with what obstacles he had
since contended, he knew not.  He became roused to the knowledge that
Obenreizer had set upon him, and that they were struggling desperately in
the snow.  He became roused to the remembrance of what his assailant
carried in a girdle.  He felt for it, drew it, struck at him, struggled
again, struck at him again, cast him off, and stood face to face with
him.

“I can, and I do,” I said.

"Yes, you are. And why couldn't you say that at once, sir? Perhaps you
know the plaintiff, too? Eh, Mr. Winkle?"

Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more
excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that
he more frequently applied himself to the gin and water, and moreover
indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming
a scientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close
attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his
companion upon these improprieties: all of which remonstrances Master
Bates took in extremely good part, merely requesting his friend to be
“blowed,” or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other
neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of
which excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling. It
was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably
lost, and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates,
appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed
most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had
never seen such a jolly game in all his born days.

Commendingly looking back at the pillow he had improvised, he left them
to their hour’s repose. Maggy was snoring already, and Little Dorrit
was soon fast asleep with her head resting on that sealed book of Fate,
untroubled by its mysterious blank leaves.

But it is not so much to the writings of Beaumarchais, as to himself,
that we wish at present to direct the attention of our readers. His life
was anything but that of a man of letters. He possessed extraordinary
talents for affairs; and, during his whole life, was deeply engaged
in important pursuits both of a private and public nature. Extensive
commercial enterprises, lawsuits of singular complication, and missions
of great moment as a political agent, withdrew him from the walks of
literature, and probably prevented him (as one of his biographers
has remarked) from enriching the French stage with twenty dramatic
masterpieces, instead of two or three. In this respect he resembled our
Sheridan, as well as in the character of his genius; for we know of no
plays that are more akin to each other, in many remarkable features,
than _The School for Scandal_ and _Le Mariage de Figaro_.

The good woman was so much alarmed by the sudden apparition of this
unknown piece of ugliness, that she hastily caught the baby from its
cradle and retreated into the furthest corner of the room; while little
Jacob, sitting upon his stool with his hands on his knees, looked full
at him in a species of fascination, roaring lustily all the time.
Richard Swiveller took an easy observation of the family over Mr Quilp’s
head, and Quilp himself, with his hands in his pockets, smiled in an
exquisite enjoyment of the commotion he occasioned.

"You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
along, have you?" inquired Sikes suspiciously. "Don't put on a injured
look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler."

"What else can I be" returned the uncle, "when I live in such

“I’ll mention it,” said Walter, “if you’ll have the goodness to let me
in, Ma’am.”

I said, ‘Yes,’ boldly; not that I knew anything about it, Heaven forgive
me!

Dreams of the summer night!
         Tell her her lover keeps
     Watch! while in slumbers light
         She sleeps
     My lady sleeps!
         Sleeps!”

‘Yes. To be sure. I am astonished indeed. I wonder he committed himself
without seeing more of his way first. Now I think of it, I suspect he
always has admired you though, my dear.’

As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young
fingers, and touched his lips.

"It's easy enough to understand," replied the choleric old gentleman.
"If you had been a younger man, you would have been in the secret long
ago; and besides," added Wardle after a moment's hesitation, "the truth
is, that, knowing nothing of this matter, I have rather pressed Emily
for four or five months past, to receive favourably (if she could; I
would never attempt to force a girl's inclinations) the addresses of
a young gentleman down in our neighbourhood. I have no doubt that,
girl-like, to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of Mr.
Snodgrass, she has represented this matter in very glowing colours, and
that they have both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly
persecuted pair of unfortunates, and have no resource but clandestine
matrimony or charcoal. Now the question is, what's to be done?"

Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent
gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed,
upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the
suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.

‘Well, Mr. Raddle,’ said Mrs. Bardell; ‘I’m sure you ought to feel very
much honoured at you and Tommy being the only gentlemen to escort so
many ladies all the way to the Spaniards, at Hampstead. Don’t you think
he ought, Mrs. Rogers, ma’am?’

'It is the best idea,' said Mr. Pickwick to himself, smiling till he
    almost cracked the night-cap strings--'It is the best idea, my losing
    myself in this place, and wandering about those staircases, that I
    ever heard of.  Droll, droll, very droll.'  Here Mr. Pickwick smiled
    again, a broader smile than before, and was about to continue the
    process of undressing, in the best possible humour, when he was
    suddenly stopped by a most unexpected interruption; to wit, the
    entrance into the room of some person with a candle, who, after
    locking the door, advanced to the dressing table, and set down the
    light upon it.

‘Tom was thinking how he should open the case, so he made no answer.

CHAPTER 16. I AM A NEW BOY IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE

‘“Well,” said Tom, slowly undressing himself, and staring at the old
chair all the while, which stood with a mysterious aspect by the
bedside, “I never saw such a rum concern as that in my days. Very odd,”
 said Tom, who had got rather sage with the hot punch--“very odd.” Tom
shook his head with an air of profound wisdom, and looked at the chair
again. He couldn’t make anything of it though, so he got into bed,
covered himself up warm, and fell asleep.

‘Precisely so,’ said Squeers.

Bradley again looked at the fire. Eyeing him aside, Riderhood took up
his pipe, refilled it, lighted it, and sat smoking. Bradley leaned his
elbows on his knees, and his head upon his hands, and looked at the fire
with a most intent abstraction.

He again begged to remark that he had not finished.

The postboy was driving briskly through the open streets, and past the
handsome and well-lighted shops that intervene between the outskirts of
the town and the Old Royal Hotel, before Mr. Pickwick had begun to
consider the very difficult and delicate nature of the commission which
had carried him thither.

Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had
him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his
own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged
the boy up.

"This is very strange," said Mr. Pickwick.

"Past," said the figures.

Mysterious and incomprehensible, the Captain, with that lively sense
upon him of having done a little business for the youngsters, remained
all day, even to his most intimate friends; and but that Walter
attributed his winks and grins, and other such pantomimic reliefs of
himself, to his satisfaction in the success of their innocent deception
upon old Sol Gills, he would assuredly have betrayed himself before
night. As it was, however, he kept his own secret; and went home late
from the Instrument-maker’s house, wearing the glazed hat so much on
one side, and carrying such a beaming expression in his eyes, that Mrs
MacStinger (who might have been brought up at Doctor Blimber’s, she was
such a Roman matron) fortified herself, at the first glimpse of him,
behind the open street door, and refused to come out to the
contemplation of her blessed infants, until he was securely lodged in
his own room.

Little Dorrit took her hand, and thanked her for all her old kindness.

‘Now,’ said Dick, walking up and down with his hands in his pockets,
‘I’d give something--if I had it--to know how they use that child, and
where they keep her.  My mother must have been a very inquisitive
woman; I have no doubt I’m marked with a note of interrogation
somewhere.  My feelings I smother, but thou hast been the cause of this
anguish, my--upon my word,’ said Mr Swiveller, checking himself and
falling thoughtfully into the client’s chair, ‘I should like to know
how they use her!’

He asked himself, besides, when dreading Mark’s decease (as all men do
and must, at such a time), whether he had done his duty by him, and had
deserved and made a good response to his fidelity and zeal. No. Short
as their companionship had been, he felt in many, many instances, that
there was blame against himself; and still inquiring why, the curtain
slowly rose a little more, and Self, Self, Self, dilated on the scene.

"Well, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, "what's the matter now?"

How the time wears, I know not; until I am recalled by my child-wife’s
old companion. More restless than he was, he crawls out of his house,
and looks at me, and wanders to the door, and whines to go upstairs.

Mr. Jarndyce got up, rubbing his head, and began to walk about. Mr.
Skimpole played the melody of one of Ada’s favourite songs. Ada and I
both looked at Mr. Jarndyce, thinking that we knew what was passing
in his mind.

"'Sorrow one of me liked his making so free. 'Go on with your game,'
says I, 'and don't be putting your _comether_[68] over my housekeeper.'

‘And _I_ warn’t a going,’ exclaimed Refractory Two, ‘though I was in one
place for as long as four year—_I_ warn’t a going fur to stop in a place
that warn’t fit for me—there!  And where the family warn’t ’spectable
characters—there!  And where I fortunately or hunfort’nately, found that
the people warn’t what they pretended to make theirselves out to
be—there!  And where it wasn’t their faults, by chalks, if I warn’t made
bad and ruinated—Hah!’

"We dug him out, suffocated and broken all to pieces!  But, monsieur, as
to Madame.  We have brought him here on the litter, to be buried.  We
must ascend the street outside.  Madame must not see.  It would be an
accursed thing to bring the litter through the arch across the street,
until Madame has passed through.  As you descend, we who accompany the
litter will set it down on the stones of the street the second to the
right, and will stand before it.  But do not let Madame turn her head
towards the street the second to the right.  There is no time to lose.
Madame will be alarmed by your absence.  Adieu!"

Being determined not to notice, I said again, that we must all lay our
heads together.

‘So it is,’ sobbed Mrs. Nickleby. ‘So it is.’

Paul was quite alarmed by Mr Feeder’s yawning; it was done on such a
great scale, and he was so terribly in earnest. All the boys too (Toots
excepted) seemed knocked up, and were getting ready for dinner—some
newly tying their neckcloths, which were very stiff indeed; and others
washing their hands or brushing their hair, in an adjoining
ante-chamber—as if they didn’t think they should enjoy it at all.

‘How was that, my friend? I no sooner mentioned your name in connection
with it than he declared off.’

"I think you will," said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the
refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. "Just a _leetle_ drop,
with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar."

A'Beckett, Gilbert, i. 134

[[[BELATED PRECAUTIONS]]]

Polly was gratified, and showed it. Mr Toodle didn’t know whether he
was gratified or not, and preserved a stolid calmness.

"Yes, I am afraid I am very little indeed," returned the child, and
began to sob, so that the milliner was touched, and took her in hand and
made her a clever workwoman.

A pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the
room as this interrogatory was put; and there issued from a door on
the right hand, first a feeble candle, and next, the form of the same
individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the
infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at
the public-house on Saffron Hill.

‘Oh! they would come fast enough,’ said Steerforth; ‘but we should
inconvenience you. You had better come and dine with us somewhere.’

Swung upon its rusty hinges, it admitted him into a yard in which there
was nothing to be seen but an outhouse attached to the ruined building,
with a barred window in it.  As there were traces of many recent
footsteps under this window, and as it was a low window, and unglazed,
Mr. Traveller made bold to peep within the bars.  And there to be sure he
had a real live Hermit before him, and could judge how the real dead
Hermits used to look.

‘You understand what that means, landlord!’ said the stranger,
drily.

Many and many happy New Years to you and yours! As many happy children
as may be quite convenient (no more!), and as many happy meetings
between them and our children, and between you and us, as the kind fates
in their utmost kindness shall favourably decree!

“Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has
said of Ma’amselle Manette?”

Many were met; of sisters, brothers, cousins,
    Aunts, uncles, nieces, sweethearts, wives, some dozens.

Mr and Mrs Henry Gowan.
     From France to Italy.

‘And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?’ asked Mr.
Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered
into between them, he had removed next day to Fagin’s house. ‘’Cod,
I thought as much last night!’

‘You will allow me, my dear, if you please, to judge for myself,’ said
Mrs. Nickleby.

But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled
out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the
deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.

‘True,’ replied old Arthur. ‘Yes--yes; I almost forgot, I do declare.’

A delightful walk it was; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June, and
their way lay through a deep and shady wood, cooled by the light wind
which gently rustled the thick foliage, and enlivened by the songs of
the birds that perched upon the boughs. The ivy and the moss crept in
thick clusters over the old trees, and the soft green turf overspread
the ground like a silken mat. They emerged upon an open park, with an
ancient hall, displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of
Elizabeth’s time. Long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on
every side; large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass; and
occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground, with the speed of
the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny
landscape like a passing breath of summer.

‘Have the goodness to keep your observashuns to yourself, Sir, I beg,’
said Mrs. Raddle, suddenly arresting the rapid torrent of her speech,
and addressing the third party with impressive slowness and solemnity.
‘I am not aweer, Sir, that you have any right to address your
conversation to me. I don’t think I let these apartments to you, Sir.’

‘I beg your pardon, sir, but I am used to find Mr Riah at this time, and
so I generally come at this time. I only want to buy my poor little two
shillings’ worth of waste. Perhaps you’ll kindly let me have it, and
I’ll trot off to my work.’

‘Ho master, ho mim!’ cried Miggs, ‘can I constrain my feelings in these
here once agin united moments! Ho Mr Warsen, here’s blessedness
among relations, sir! Here’s forgivenesses of injuries, here’s
amicablenesses!’

"Ah!" said Sam. "I should ha' 'sposed that, but I 'spose you were never
cold with all them elastic fixtures?"

Wishing to be fully re-established in my strength and my good spirits
before Ada came, I now laid down a little series of plans with
Charley for being in the fresh air all day long. We were to be out
before breakfast, and were to dine early, and were to be out again
before and after dinner, and were to talk in the garden after tea,
and were to go to rest betimes, and were to climb every hill and
explore every road, lane, and field in the neighbourhood. As to
restoratives and strengthening delicacies, Mr. Boythorn’s good
housekeeper was for ever trotting about with something to eat or
drink in her hand; I could not even be heard of as resting in the
park but she would come trotting after me with a basket, her cheerful
face shining with a lecture on the importance of frequent
nourishment. Then there was a pony expressly for my riding, a chubby
pony with a short neck and a mane all over his eyes who could
canter—when he would—so easily and quietly that he was a treasure.
In a very few days he would come to me in the paddock when I called
him, and eat out of my hand, and follow me about. We arrived at such
a capital understanding that when he was jogging with me lazily, and
rather obstinately, down some shady lane, if I patted his neck and
said, “Stubbs, I am surprised you don’t canter when you know how much
I like it; and I think you might oblige me, for you are only getting
stupid and going to sleep,” he would give his head a comical shake or
two and set off directly, while Charley would stand still and laugh
with such enjoyment that her laughter was like music. I don’t know
who had given Stubbs his name, but it seemed to belong to him as
naturally as his rough coat. Once we put him in a little chaise and
drove him triumphantly through the green lanes for five miles; but
all at once, as we were extolling him to the skies, he seemed to take
it ill that he should have been accompanied so far by the circle of
tantalizing little gnats that had been hovering round and round his
ears the whole way without appearing to advance an inch, and stopped
to think about it. I suppose he came to the decision that it was not
to be borne, for he steadily refused to move until I gave the reins
to Charley and got out and walked, when he followed me with a sturdy
sort of good humour, putting his head under my arm and rubbing his
ear against my sleeve. It was in vain for me to say, “Now, Stubbs, I
feel quite sure from what I know of you that you will go on if I ride
a little while,” for the moment I left him, he stood stock still
again. Consequently I was obliged to lead the way, as before; and in
this order we returned home, to the great delight of the village.

‘We may place our men, then, I think,’ observed the officer, with as
much indifference as if the principals were chess-men, and the seconds
players.

‘There ain’t no vurks in it,’ whispered his father. ‘It ‘ull hold him
easy, vith his hat and shoes on, and breathe through the legs, vich his
holler. Have a passage ready taken for ‘Merriker. The ‘Merrikin gov’ment
will never give him up, ven vunce they find as he’s got money to spend,
Sammy. Let the gov’nor stop there, till Mrs. Bardell’s dead, or Mr.
Dodson and Fogg’s hung (wich last ewent I think is the most likely to
happen first, Sammy), and then let him come back and write a book about
the ‘Merrikins as’ll pay all his expenses and more, if he blows ‘em up
enough.’

At the word of command, a dirty-faced man, something over six feet
high, and stout in proportion, squeezed himself through the half-open
door (making his face very red in the process), and entered the room.

"Aha!" said the old man, a brief description of whose manner and
appearance concluded the last chapter, "Aha! who was talking about the
Inns?"

“Don’t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?” asked Noah,
shaking his head. “I don’t think that would answer my purpose. Ain’t
there any other line open?”

“I beg your pardon, Lady Dedlock. Will you allow me to retire?”

‘Those are not good prospects for a painter,’ said Clennam.

‘No, sir.’

Mr. Omer’s face and manner went for so much, that I could
conscientiously nod my head, as divining his meaning. My quickness of
apprehension seemed to please him, and he went on: ‘Now I consider this
is principally on account of her being in an unsettled state, you
see. We have talked it over a good deal, her uncle and myself, and her
sweetheart and myself, after business; and I consider it is principally
on account of her being unsettled. You must always recollect of Em’ly,’
said Mr. Omer, shaking his head gently, ‘that she’s a most extraordinary
affectionate little thing. The proverb says, “You can’t make a silk
purse out of a sow’s ear.” Well, I don’t know about that. I rather think
you may, if you begin early in life. She has made a home out of that old
boat, sir, that stone and marble couldn’t beat.’

Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring
apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and
his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions
and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular light upon any
thing, save the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,
his declarations that he should’nt know the real boy if he were put
before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,
because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes
previously, admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much
afraid he had been a little too hasty.

Sheridan had not been long at Harrow when he attracted the favourable
notice of Dr. Parr, at that time one of the head-masters of the
establishment, who, perceiving in him unquestionable evidences of
superior capacity, did all he could to stimulate him to exertion. But
his endeavours were fruitless, for the boy was incorrigibly idle, though
a general favourite by reason of his good-humour and the social turn
of his mind,--and left Harrow at the age of eighteen, with a slender
amount of Latin and less Greek, but at the same time with a very fair
acquaintance with the lighter branches of English literature.

Part the Third

“In fact, I have just turned into my teens,” says Mr. Jobling.

Mr. Smallweed, purposely balking himself in an aim at the trooper’s
head, throws the pipe on the ground and breaks it to pieces.

‘What an old hand you are, Mr Chuzzlewit!’ said Tigg, leaning back in
his chair, and leering at him through his half-shut eyes.

"Oh, I am so glad," replied Mr. Trotter. "Is he here?"

It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips, though it was
no surprise.

Do not crouch to-day, and worship
The old Past, whose life is fled,
Hush your voice to tender reverence;
Crowned he lies, but cold and dead:
For the Present reigns our monarch,
With an added weight of hours;
Honour her, for she is mighty!
Honour her, for she is ours!

‘Pray come in,’ said Arthur; for Mr Chivery’s head was still put in at
the door a very little way, and Mr Chivery had but one ear upon him,
instead of both eyes. This was native delicacy in Mr Chivery--true
politeness; though his exterior had very much of a turnkey about it, and
not the least of a gentleman.

I grieve to reply to your note, that I am obliged to read at Newcastle
on the 21st. Poor Arthur Smith had pledged me to do so before I knew
that my annual engagement with you was being encroached on. I am
heartily sorry for this, and shall miss my usual place at your table,
quite as much (to say the least) as my place can possibly miss me. You
may be sure that I shall drink to my dear old friend in a bumper that
day, with love and best wishes. Don't leave me out next year for having
been carried away north this time.

‘Of this man Pickwick I will say little; the subject presents but few
attractions; and I, gentlemen, am not the man, nor are you, gentlemen,
the men, to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness, and
of systematic villainy.’

‘I only wanted,’ replied the trembling Marchioness, ‘to know where the
key of the safe was hid; that was all; and I wouldn’t have taken much,
if I had found it--only enough to squench my hunger.’

“That son. He has but one.”

The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,
constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an
ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.

‘I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion, sir,’ he
rejoined. ‘It is not often that I venture to give a non-medical opinion,
I assure you. Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes, and it
is said,--in short, sir, it is said by Mrs. Chillip,--that the darker
tyrant he has lately been, the more ferocious is his doctrine.’

Every possible inquiry was made, and every place was searched. The
brick-kilns were examined, the cottages were visited, the two women
were particularly questioned, but they knew nothing of him, and
nobody could doubt that their wonder was genuine. The weather had for
some time been too wet and the night itself had been too wet to admit
of any tracing by footsteps. Hedge and ditch, and wall, and rick and
stack, were examined by our men for a long distance round, lest the
boy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead; but nothing
was seen to indicate that he had ever been near. From the time when
he was left in the loft-room, he vanished.

‘Tupman,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘a secret of some delicacy, in which that
lady is concerned, is the cause of a difference which has just arisen
between this gentleman and myself. When I assure him, in your presence,
that it has no relation to himself, and is not in any way connected with
his affairs, I need hardly beg you to take notice that if he continue to
dispute it, he expresses a doubt of my veracity, which I shall consider
extremely insulting.’ As Mr. Pickwick said this, he looked encyclopedias
at Mr. Peter Magnus.

"As I have nothing particular to communicate, I shall follow your
example," said the West, looking significantly at the East.

_Manager._--Quite unnecessary, sir. I don't think what you could do
would suit our audience.

The Haunted and the Haunters;
Or, The House and the Brain

"How is this known?" asked Dupin.

Sam bore in mind his master's caution, and replied--

And I in grief abstracted.

The coachman, he not likin' the job,
  Set off at a full gal-lop,
  But Dick put a couple of balls in his nob,
  And perwailed on him to stop.

“Just so, sir,” returns Mr. Snagsby; “I was sure you would feel it
yourself and would excuse the reasonableness of MY feelings when
coupled with the known excitableness of my little woman. You see, the
foreign female—which you mentioned her name just now, with quite a
native sound I am sure—caught up the word Snagsby that night, being
uncommon quick, and made inquiry, and got the direction and come at
dinner-time. Now Guster, our young woman, is timid and has fits, and
she, taking fright at the foreigner’s looks—which are fierce—and at
a grinding manner that she has of speaking—which is calculated to
alarm a weak mind—gave way to it, instead of bearing up against it,
and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another, such
fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into, or come out of, in
any house but ours. Consequently there was by good fortune ample
occupation for my little woman, and only me to answer the shop. When
she DID say that Mr. Tulkinghorn, being always denied to her by his
employer (which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of
viewing a clerk), she would do herself the pleasure of continually
calling at my place until she was let in here. Since then she has
been, as I began by saying, hovering, hovering, sir”—Mr. Snagsby
repeats the word with pathetic emphasis—“in the court. The effects
of which movement it is impossible to calculate. I shouldn’t wonder
if it might have already given rise to the painfullest mistakes even
in the neighbours’ minds, not mentioning (if such a thing was
possible) my little woman. Whereas, goodness knows,” says Mr.
Snagsby, shaking his head, “I never had an idea of a foreign female,
except as being formerly connected with a bunch of brooms and a baby,
or at the present time with a tambourine and earrings. I never had, I
do assure you, sir!”

“Very difficult to say,” returns the lawyer, shaking his head. “He
had lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his gipsy colour
and his wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him
the commonest of the common. The surgeon had a notion that he had
once been something better, both in appearance and condition.”

And "she" is near you, is she? O I remember her well! And I am still of
my old opinion! Passionately devoted to her sex as I am (they are the
weakness of my existence), I still consider her a failure. She had some
extraordinary christian-name, which I forget. Lashed into verse by my
feelings, I am inclined to write:

“My life,” says the unhappy stationer, “would you have any objections
to mention why, being in general so delicately circumspect in your
conduct, you come into a wine-vaults before breakfast?”

Now Moss, for the first time, bethought himself of the boy he had
brought in from the meadow; and now, for the first time, he told his
family of that encounter.

‘_You_ have come fast, considering!’ retorted Quilp; ‘you creep, you dog,
you crawl, you measure distance like a worm.  There are the chimes now,
half-past twelve.’

Taking a confused leave of Anthony and his son, and leaving the luggage
of himself and daughters at the office to be called for afterwards, Mr
Pecksniff, with one of the young ladies under each arm, dived across the
street, and then across other streets, and so up the queerest courts,
and down the strangest alleys and under the blindest archways, in a kind
of frenzy; now skipping over a kennel, now running for his life from a
coach and horses; now thinking he had lost his way, now thinking he had
found it; now in a state of the highest confidence, now despondent to
the last degree, but always in a great perspiration and flurry; until at
length they stopped in a kind of paved yard near the Monument. That is
to say, Mr Pecksniff told them so; for as to anything they could see
of the Monument, or anything else but the buildings close at hand, they
might as well have been playing blindman’s buff at Salisbury.

“OF all the cants that are canted in this canting world,” wrote Sterne,
“kind Heaven defend me from the cant of Art!”  We have no intention of
tapping our little cask of cant, soured by the thunder of great men’s
fame, for the refreshment of our readers: its freest draught would be
unreasonably dear at a shilling, when the same small liquor may be had
for nothing, at innumerable ready pipes and conduits.

 FINE ARTS                          _Thomas De Quincey_              147

“Oh you needn’t thank me, Polly,” said her sister, giving her a
sounding kiss upon the cheek, and then dancing little Paul cheerfully.
“I say the same of you sometimes, and think it too.”

‘Yes,’ returned Stephen.  ‘He were ett’n and drinking—as large and as
loud as a Hummobee.’

"Lent it to her mamma, indeed!" cried Madame Alexandre. "Why, Madame
Courson has as handsome a Thibet shawl as ever came out of Ternaux's
factory."

“You said about ten,” Tony repeats. “Yes, so you did say about ten.
But according to my count, it’s ten times ten—it’s a hundred
o’clock. I never had such a night in my life!”

At intervals all next day, and even while his attention was fixed on
other things, he thought of Mr Pancks’s investment of his thousand
pounds, and of his having ‘looked into it.’ He thought of Mr Pancks’s
being so sanguine in this matter, and of his not being usually of a
sanguine character. He thought of the great National Department, and of
the delight it would be to him to see Doyce better off. He thought
of the darkly threatening place that went by the name of Home in his
remembrance, and of the gathering shadows which made it yet more darkly
threatening than of old. He observed anew that wherever he went, he
saw, or heard, or touched, the celebrated name of Merdle; he found it
difficult even to remain at his desk a couple of hours, without having
it presented to one of his bodily senses through some agency or other.
He began to think it was curious too that it should be everywhere, and
that nobody but he should seem to have any mistrust of it. Though indeed
he began to remember, when he got to this, even _he_ did not mistrust it;
he had only happened to keep aloof from it.

‘The fact is,’ began Bradley, with a mouth so dry that he had some
difficulty in articulating his words: the consciousness of which
rendered his manner still more ungainly and undecided; ‘the truth is,
that Charley, having no secrets from me (to the best of my belief), has
confided the whole of this matter to me.’

The witness returned to town, as he had every reason to do, with a
light heart; and as he never heard any further intelligence either
of the half-dozen gentlemen, or the six Lucretias to whom he had so
unwittingly introduced his wife, he experienced no further trouble or
disquiet on this score.

‘Can’t--can’t we be married before to-morrow morning?’ inquired Rachael.

“Cut my limbs off one by one!” cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the
arm, “If I don’t think the gal’s stark raving mad. Get up.”

"But you don't know," said I, "that Emily was charitable to her, with
Ham's help, long before she fled from home. Nor, that, when we met one
night, and spoke together in the room yonder, over the way, she listened
at the door."

When he sat in his little arm-chair with his father, after dinner, they
were a strange pair,--so like, and so unlike each other.

“It is not so mad as that. I am glad to hear it!”

‘Not exactly a friend,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, in a low tone. ‘The fact
is, he is my servant, but I allow him to take a good many liberties;
for, between ourselves, I flatter myself he is an original, and I am
rather proud of him.’

‘Tolerable,’ returned Mr Venus. ‘Not much to boast of.’

FOOTNOTES

‘Becoming.’

“Toby,” he says with a quiet smile, “the little man will now walk three
times round the Cairawan, and then retire behind the curtain.”

This charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic
lunacy, while his friend shows a dazed mind in his whole head of hair
and even in his cultivated whiskers.

‘Are you aware, sir, that you’ve been trespassing?’

Punishment of death, Dickens on the, 78

It is an awful thing to think of the enormous caverns that are entered
from some Roman churches, and undermine the city.  Many churches have
crypts and subterranean chapels of great size, which, in the ancient
time, were baths, and secret chambers of temples, and what not: but I do
not speak of them.  Beneath the church of St. Giovanni and St. Paolo,
there are the jaws of a terrific range of caverns, hewn out of the rock,
and said to have another outlet underneath the Coliseum—tremendous
darknesses of vast extent, half-buried in the earth and unexplorable,
where the dull torches, flashed by the attendants, glimmer down long
ranges of distant vaults branching to the right and left, like streets in
a city of the dead; and show the cold damp stealing down the walls,
drip-drop, drip-drop, to join the pools of water that lie here and there,
and never saw, or never will see, one ray of the sun.  Some accounts make
these the prisons of the wild beasts destined for the amphitheatre; some
the prisons of the condemned gladiators; some, both.  But the legend most
appalling to the fancy is, that in the upper range (for there are two
stories of these caves) the Early Christians destined to be eaten at the
Coliseum Shows, heard the wild beasts, hungry for them, roaring down
below; until, upon the night and solitude of their captivity, there burst
the sudden noon and life of the vast theatre crowded to the parapet, and
of these, their dreaded neighbours, bounding in!

"_I_ seek!" exclaimed the Spirit.

“I think, my dear fellow,” returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon
his shoulder, “that youth has many generous impulses which do not last;
and that among them are some which, being gratified, become only the
more fleeting. Above all, I think,” said the lady, fixing her eyes on
her son’s face, “that if an enthusiastic, ardent, ambitious young man
has a wife on whose name is a stain, which, though it originate in no
fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and
upon his children also, and, in exact proportion to his success in the
world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against
him, he may—no matter how generous and good his nature—one day repent
of the connexion he formed in early life, and she may have the pain and
torture of knowing that he does so.”

Well! I loved her, and I went on loving her, most absorbingly, entirely,
and completely. But going on, too, working pretty hard, and busily
keeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire, I would sit
sometimes of a night, opposite my aunt, thinking how I had frightened
Dora that time, and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case
through the forest of difficulty, until I used to fancy that my head was
turning quite grey.

“I got the gloves last evening, Eddy, and I like them very much. They
are beauties.”

At this inquiry, the clamour was increased twenty-fold, and an
astounding string of such shrill contradictions as ‘He’s poisoned
himself’--‘He hasn’t’--‘Send for a doctor’--‘Don’t’--‘He’s dying’--‘He
isn’t, he’s only pretending’--with various other cries, poured forth
with bewildering volubility, until Madame Mantalini was seen to address
herself to Ralph, when female curiosity to know what she would say,
prevailed, and, as if by general consent, a dead silence, unbroken by a
single whisper, instantaneously succeeded.

‘Hush!’ said the gentleman who had spoken first. ‘You know you’ve
got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish,
don’t you?’

The day soon came for our going. It was such an early day that it came
soon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and half afraid
that an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsion
of nature, might interpose to stop the expedition. We were to go in a
carrier’s cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast. I would
have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night,
and sleep in my hat and boots.

Her name and family?

A thunderbolt in the great hall had been a _bagatelle_ to it.

‘You are so very pale,’ said Kit, ‘that I should hardly have known you.’

The philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an
affirmative.

She ran over in her mind again, all that he had said by the sun-dial in
the garden. He had persisted in treating the disappearance as murder,
consistently with his whole public course since the finding of the
watch and shirt-pin. If he were afraid of the crime being traced out,
would he not rather encourage the idea of a voluntary disappearance? He
had even declared that if the ties between him and his nephew had been
less strong, he might have swept “even him” away from her side. Was
that like his having really done so? He had spoken of laying his six
months’ labours in the cause of a just vengeance at her feet. Would he
have done that, with that violence of passion, if they were a pretence?
Would he have ranged them with his desolate heart and soul, his wasted
life, his peace and his despair? The very first sacrifice that he
represented himself as making for her, was his fidelity to his dear boy
after death. Surely these facts were strong against a fancy that
scarcely dared to hint itself. And yet he was so terrible a man! In
short, the poor girl (for what could she know of the criminal
intellect, which its own professed students perpetually misread,
because they persist in trying to reconcile it with the average
intellect of average men, instead of identifying it as a horrible
wonder apart) could get by no road to any other conclusion than that he
_was_ a terrible man, and must be fled from.

“A job,” says Mr. George.

‘Are all agreed to,’ answered the single gentleman.

"To be sure I did," said Phelim. "Haven't you, like a drunken baste as
you are, (begging your pardon for my bouldness,) been trying to broach
that bottle of champagne at this early hour of the mornin', and haven't
you driven the cork through the lookin'-glass?"

‘Oh!’ cried the gentleman, surveying Tom attentively. ‘You really are
Miss Pinch’s brother, I presume? You will excuse my asking. I don’t
observe any resemblance.’

FOOTNOTE:

“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to
swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake?”

"And where are you going to-day?" asked the little man with the red
nose.

‘I am one of the many he has ruined. Yes.’

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Saturday, Feb. 20th, 1858._

My poor little visitor made me a present of the account, and when as
the evening began to close in she rose to take her leave, lest she
should miss the coach by which she was to return, she was still full
of the shipwreck, which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to
understand in all its details.

“Hurt?” said Rob. “He’s got a master that would find it out if he was
touched with a straw.” And he blew upon the place where the old woman’s
hand had rested for a moment, and smoothed it gently with his finger,
as if he seriously believed what he said.

‘Horses are paid, Tom,’ screamed Mrs. Williamson; and away went the
chaise, at the rate of fourteen miles an hour, with Mr. Alexander Trott
and Miss Julia Manners carefully shut up in the inside.

There was nothing more to be done; there was absolutely no choice but to
go back to London, defeated at all points.  From time to time on the
return journey, the wine-merchant looked at his copy of the entry in the
Foundling Register.  There is one among the many forms of despair--perhaps
the most pitiable of all--which persists in disguising itself as Hope.
Wilding checked himself in the act of throwing the useless morsel of
paper out of the carriage window.  "It may lead to something yet," he
thought.  "While I live, I won't part with it.  When I die, my executors
shall find it sealed up with my will."

‘No,’ said Mr Merdle, ‘I am no better.’

"Never done us foul, and false, and wicked wrong, in words?" pursued the
Goblin of the Bell.

I had nothing better to offer, than another timid "Oh, indeed!"

Striving, as it would seem, to lose part of the bitterness of his
regrets in the bitterness of these other thoughts, Ralph continued to
pace the room. There was less and less of resolution in his manner as
his mind gradually reverted to his loss; at length, dropping into his
elbow-chair and grasping its sides so firmly that they creaked again, he
said:

‘He doats on it, your worship,’ replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly
pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn’t.

I was very much surprised by the inquiry; but could give no information
on this point.

"Oh! with all my heart," said Grimaldi. "But this is something new, I
suspect, with you. Last night, I remember, it was three hours later
than this, before you suffered me to retire; and the night previous it
was later even than that."

‘I want to know,’ persisted Mr. Indignation Cocker, ‘the meaning of
ninepence.  I want to know the meaning of sherry one and eightpence
yesterday, and of here we are again two shillings.  Send somebody.’

‘How many teeth has she, ma’am?’

"'Dreadful!' said Tom Smart.

“Nor to hear, miss,” returned Mr. Vholes. “A little music does
occasionally stray in, but we are not musical in the law and soon
eject it. I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as his friends could wish
him?”

‘Perfectly right, dear Madame Flintwinch. You have a genius for
dreaming.’

'Oh, I am better now,' said Mrs. Bardell, faintly.

In one bed, lay a man whose life had been saved (as it was hoped) by deep
incisions in the feet and legs.  While I was speaking to him, a nurse
came up to change the poultices which this operation had rendered
necessary, and I had an instinctive feeling that it was not well to turn
away, merely to spare myself.  He was sorely wasted and keenly
susceptible, but the efforts he made to subdue any expression of
impatience or suffering, were quite heroic.  It was easy to see, in the
shrinking of the figure, and the drawing of the bed-clothes over the
head, how acute the endurance was, and it made me shrink too, as if I
were in pain; but, when the new bandages were on, and the poor feet were
composed again, he made an apology for himself (though he had not uttered
a word), and said plaintively, ‘I am so tender and weak, you see, sir!’
Neither from him nor from any one sufferer of the whole ghastly number,
did I hear a complaint.  Of thankfulness for present solicitude and care,
I heard much; of complaint, not a word.

I told Warrick of my meeting with Stein, and he, having nothing else to
do, sauntered off in the afternoon to bring him down. I told Ellen also,
who, to my surprise, reddened and grew pale, when I named him.

“Three pound ten,” repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.

The Captain hastily produced the big watch, the teaspoons, the
sugar-tongs, and the canister, and laying them on the table, swept them
with his great hand into Walter’s hat; but in handing that singular
strong box to Walter, he was so overcome again, that he was fain to
make another retreat into the shop, and absent himself for a longer
space of time than on his first retirement.

The places we have lodged in, the roads we have gone over, the company
we have been among, the tobacco-spittle we have wallowed in, the strange
customs we have complied with, the packing-cases in which we have
travelled, the woods, swamps, rivers, prairies, lakes, and mountains we
have crossed, are all subjects for legends and tales at home; quires,
reams, wouldn't hold them. I don't think Anne has so much as seen an
American tree. She never looks at a prospect by any chance, or displays
the smallest emotion at any sight whatever. She objects to Niagara that
"it's nothing but water," and considers that "there is too much of
that."

"She--excuse me--Miss D., you know," said Traddles, colouring in his
great delicacy, "lives in London, I believe?"

‘Europian!’ remarked Chollop, with sardonic pity. ‘Quite Europian!’

Tilly was hushing the baby, and she crossed and recrossed Tackleton a
dozen times, repeating drowsily:

‘—Hear me out!’ cried Wegg. ‘I said so. I paid a shilling (never mind
your sixpence of it) to look up that will. Brother, that will is dated
months before this will. And now, as a fellow-man, and as a partner in a
friendly move,’ added Wegg, benignantly taking him by both hands again,
and clapping him on both knees again, ‘say have I completed my labour of
love to your perfect satisfaction, and are you sap—pur—IZED?’

VERSE: A STUDENT

In short, it was a day of serene and tranquil happiness; and as we
all have some bright day--many of us, let us hope, among a crowd of
others--to which we revert with particular delight, so this one was
often looked back to afterwards, as holding a conspicuous place in the
calendar of those who shared it.

‘Now, lookee here, by dear,’ returned old Betty—‘asking your excuse
for being so familiar, but being of a time of life a’most to be your
grandmother twice over. Now, lookee, here. ’Tis a poor living and a
hard as is to be got out of this work that I’m a doing now, and but for
Sloppy I don’t know as I should have held to it this long. But it did
just keep us on, the two together. Now that I’m alone—with even Johnny
gone—I’d far sooner be upon my feet and tiring of myself out, than a
sitting folding and folding by the fire. And I’ll tell you why. There’s
a deadness steals over me at times, that the kind of life favours and I
don’t like. Now, I seem to have Johnny in my arms—now, his mother—now,
his mother’s mother—now, I seem to be a child myself, a lying once
again in the arms of my own mother—then I get numbed, thought and
sense, till I start out of my seat, afeerd that I’m a growing like the
poor old people that they brick up in the Unions, as you may sometimes
see when they let ’em out of the four walls to have a warm in the sun,
crawling quite scared about the streets. I was a nimble girl, and have
always been a active body, as I told your lady, first time ever I see
her good face. I can still walk twenty mile if I am put to it. I’d far
better be a walking than a getting numbed and dreary. I’m a good fair
knitter, and can make many little things to sell. The loan from your
lady and gentleman of twenty shillings to fit out a basket with, would
be a fortune for me. Trudging round the country and tiring of myself
out, I shall keep the deadness off, and get my own bread by my own
labour. And what more can I want?’

"Come, none of this, my man; this won't do with me," said the owner of
the rough coat, raising his voice, and turning white. "Here, Smouch!"

“Very much so indeed, ma’am,” said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a
chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to
distress her.

Eugene Wrayburn went the opposite way, with his hands behind him and his
purpose in his thoughts. He passed the sheep, and passed the gate, and
came within hearing of the village sounds, and came to the bridge. The
inn where he stayed, like the village and the mill, was not across
the river, but on that side of the stream on which he walked. However,
knowing the rushy bank and the backwater on the other side to be a
retired place, and feeling out of humour for noise or company, he
crossed the bridge, and sauntered on: looking up at the stars as they
seemed one by one to be kindled in the sky, and looking down at the
river as the same stars seemed to be kindled deep in the water. A
landing-place overshadowed by a willow, and a pleasure-boat lying moored
there among some stakes, caught his eye as he passed along. The spot was
in such dark shadow, that he paused to make out what was there, and then
passed on again.

Most of these are extremely consistent with the personal comfort of
the individual adopting them; but the "bed-maker" of the crib which
I now occupied, had departed widely from all these well-approved and
convenient plans, and conceived the comforts of a bed to consist in
the following items:--one narrow, short trough of deal or oak plank,
as may be; one mattress of half the same size, stuffed tightly with an
unelastic, unyielding substance called "flock;" one oblong pillow of
the same material and consistency; two blankets rather shorter than the
mattress; two sheets rather shorter than the blankets; one counterpane
rather shorter than the sheets; each declining in a sort of gradual
progression, so that, if there had been fifty of them the last would
have ended in a piece of tape, or a penny riband.

‘I mean, Mr Pancks, that you must be sharper with the people, sharper
with the people, much sharper with the people, sir. You don’t squeeze
them. You don’t squeeze them. Your receipts are not up to the mark. You
must squeeze them, sir, or our connection will not continue to be as
satisfactory as I could wish it to be to all parties. All parties.’

A coroner's inquest was held on the following day. The testimony of the
medical gentlemen who had been promptly called in, fully established
the fact that his death had arisen from causes purely natural; and the
jury at once returned a verdict that he had died by the visitation of
God.

The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house. The next
door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at
the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.

“Far in this den of infamous resort.”

‘Come, come!’ said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder.
‘You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you
safe and well.’

“Oh, here’s a woman for you!” cried the unfortunate Rob, in an outburst
of feeble lamentation over his own helplessness. “What did you wish to
know next, Misses Brown?”

‘Good gracious me!’ cried Traddles, opening his eyes in his old way.
‘Didn’t you get my last letter?’

The short-story commenced its career as a verbal utterance, or, as
Robert Louis Stevenson puts it, with "the first men who told their
stories round the savage camp-fire."

The dog, with a ferocious bark, made one other struggle as Blandois
vanished; then, in the moment of the dog’s submission, the master,
little less angry than the dog, felled him with a blow on the head, and
standing over him, struck him many times severely with the heel of his
boot, so that his mouth was presently bloody.

Beaucourt, M., i. 297, 357, 439

‘Will you tell me why?’

There was an air of superiority about them both, and something in their
appearance so unusual in such a place, that a respectful silence was
observed until the _whirr—r—bang_ of the spring door announced that
they were out of hearing. It was broken by the wife of the
ex-fruiterer.

[Illustration: _Oliver amazed at the Dodger’s mode of “going to work.”_]

Sitting opposite to them was a gentleman in a high state of tobacco, who
wore quite a little beard, composed of the overflowing of that weed, as
they had dried about his mouth and chin; so common an ornament that it
would scarcely have attracted Martin’s observation, but that this good
citizen, burning to assert his equality against all comers, sucked his
knife for some moments, and made a cut with it at the butter, just as
Martin was in the act of taking some. There was a juiciness about the
deed that might have sickened a scavenger.

There was great rejoicing all over the land when the Lords of the
Council went down to Hatfield, to hail the Princess Elizabeth as the
new Queen of England. Weary of the barbarities of Mary’s reign, the
people looked with hope and gladness to the new Sovereign. The nation
seemed to wake from a horrible dream; and Heaven, so long hidden by the
smoke of the fires that roasted men and women to death, appeared to
brighten once more.

‘Take a glass of wine with me,’ said Thomas Idle, ‘and let _us_ be
social.’

"Mr. Taylor wished to engage my services," I replied, "and I declined
to leave Mr. Bromley."

‘Truly,’ said I, ‘when I come to think of it, not a few.  From the
Niagara, downward to the mountain rivers of Italy, which are like the
national spirit—very tame, or chafing suddenly and bursting bounds, only
to dwindle away again.  The Moselle, and the Rhine, and the Rhone; and
the Seine, and the Saone; and the St. Lawrence, Mississippi, and Ohio;
and the Tiber, the Po, and the Arno; and the—’

I don't _quite_ like the title, "The Social History of London." I should
better like some title to the effect, "The History of London's Social
Changes in so many Years." Such a title would promise more, and better
express your intention. What do you think of taking for a first title,
"London's Changes"? You could then add the second title, "Being a
History," etc.

"You _shall_ go, my dear," said the old gentleman. "The books are on a
chair by my table. Fetch them down."

‘Indeed,’ said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man’s face;
‘indeed, I--’

"You shall open a broker's shop in Boston next month," said the black
man.

Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes his head. “No. If you were a man of
business, sergeant, you would not need to be informed that there are
confidential reasons, very harmless in themselves, for many such
wants in the profession to which I belong. But if you are afraid of
doing any injury to Captain Hawdon, you may set your mind at rest
about that.”

    at Naples, 155

‘So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?’ said the Jew, taking
up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace;
‘eh?’

Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird’s mouth
described by the term in question.

‘My child, your favourable opinion, then, of your husband—you don’t
object to that phrase, darling?’

The youth and innocence of the pretty little William Fitz-Robert (for
that was his name) made him many friends at that time. When he became a
young man, the King of France, uniting with the French Counts of Anjou
and Flanders, supported his cause against the King of England, and took
many of the King’s towns and castles in Normandy. But, King Henry,
artful and cunning always, bribed some of William’s friends with money,
some with promises, some with power. He bought off the Count of Anjou,
by promising to marry his eldest son, also named William, to the
Count’s daughter; and indeed the whole trust of this King’s life was in
such bargains, and he believed (as many another King has done since,
and as one King did in France a very little time ago) that every man’s
truth and honour can be bought at some price. For all this, he was so
afraid of William Fitz-Robert and his friends, that, for a long time,
he believed his life to be in danger; and never lay down to sleep, even
in his palace surrounded by his guards, without having a sword and
buckler at his bedside.

“Here,” said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him
down. “Here’s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I
suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?”

"No.  It was silent."

At first, Nicholas thought the mysterious man was in a fit, but, on
further consideration, decided that he was in liquor, under which
circumstances he deemed it prudent to make off at once. He looked back
when he had got the street-door open. Newman Noggs was still indulging
in the same extraordinary gestures, and the cracking of his fingers
sounded louder that ever.

The girl’s life had been squandered in the streets, and the most
noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the
woman’s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light
step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered,
and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another
moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame,
and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with
whom she had sought this interview.

CHAPTER 59

"Certainly," said Mr. Pickwick: and down they sat.

‘Observe,’ he whispered in the widow’s ear: ‘In him, of whose existence
I was ignorant until to-night, I have you in my power. Be careful how
you use me. Be careful how you use me. I am destitute and starving, and
a wanderer upon the earth. I may take a sure and slow revenge.’

[57] Great-coat.

“You can’t try, Handel?”

‘Very well where you are! I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with
me. How came you to get into such company as that little witch’s?’

CHAPTER II.
A Sight

Joe was by no means a sheepish fellow, but, for all that, when he got
to the corner of the street in which the locksmith lived, he could by no
means make up his mind to walk straight to the house. First, he resolved
to stroll up another street for five minutes, then up another street for
five minutes more, and so on until he had lost full half an hour, when
he made a bold plunge and found himself with a red face and a beating
heart in the smoky workshop.

‘Heaven knows I love you dearly!’

IN WHICH THE TABLES ARE TURNED, COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN

Her heart throbbed and beat; she trembled with a strange happiness and
sat as one entranced till the music was over. Then came reading, the
rustle and murmur of people kneeling, and then they all rose and there
was the solemn buzz of voices repeating the Creed with a curious lulling
sound to her ear. There was old Mr. Danforth with his spectacles on,
reading with a pompous tone, as if to witness a good confession for the
church; and there were Squire Lewis and old Ma'am Lewis; and there was
one place where they all bowed their heads and all the ladies made
courtesies--all of which entertained her mightily.

Still he grew famous--many came to be
His pupils in the art of harmony.
One day a voice floated so pure and free
Above his music, that he turned to see
What angel sang, and saw before his eyes,
What made his heart leap with a strange surprise,
His own White Maiden, calm, and pure, and mild,
As in his childish dreams she sang and smiled;
Her eyes raised up to Heaven, her lips apart,
And music overflowing from her heart.
But the faint blush that tinged her cheek betrayed
No marble statue, but a living maid;
Perplexed and startled at his wondering look,
Her rustling score of Mozart's Sanctus shook;
The uncertain notes, like birds within a snare,
Fluttered and died upon the trembling air.

‘Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass,’ said he.
This proposition, like the other, was received with unanimous applause.
Having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box,
purchased from the landlady for the purpose, he placed himself in an
arm-chair, at the head of the table; and the evening was devoted to
festivity and conversation.

"To be sure!" said my aunt, patting her cheek again. "You are right."

“You are in late,” he said.  “I have been waiting for you three-quarters
of an hour.  Shall we dine together to-day?”

So, everybody found out all in a moment that the country _must_ be
prosperous and happy, having another Stuart to condescend to reign over
it; and there was a prodigious firing off of guns, lighting of
bonfires, ringing of bells, and throwing up of caps. The people drank
the King’s health by thousands in the open streets, and everybody
rejoiced. Down came the Arms of the Commonwealth, up went the Royal
Arms instead, and out came the public money. Fifty thousand pounds for
the King, ten thousand pounds for his brother the Duke of York, five
thousand pounds for his brother the Duke of Gloucester. Prayers for
these gracious Stuarts were put up in all the churches; commissioners
were sent to Holland (which suddenly found out that Charles was a great
man, and that it loved him) to invite the King home; Monk and the
Kentish grandees went to Dover, to kneel down before him as he landed.
He kissed and embraced Monk, made him ride in the coach with himself
and his brothers, came on to London amid wonderful shoutings, and
passed through the army at Blackheath on the twenty-ninth of May (his
birthday), in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty. Greeted by
splendid dinners under tents, by flags and tapestry streaming from all
the houses, by delighted crowds in all the streets, by troops of
noblemen and gentlemen in rich dresses, by City companies, train-bands,
drummers, trumpeters, the great Lord Mayor, and the majestic Aldermen,
the King went on to Whitehall. On entering it, he commemorated his
Restoration with the joke that it really would seem to have been his
own fault that he had not come long ago, since everybody told him that
he had always wished for him with all his heart.

"Of course there is a chance. I hope it may prove a good one. They
are unquestionably penitent now; but then, you know, they have the
recollection of very recent suffering fresh upon them. What they may
become, when that fades away, is a problem that neither you nor I can
solve. However, my dear sir," added Perker, laying his hand on Mr.
Pickwick's shoulder, "your object is equally honourable, whatever
the result is. Whether that species of benevolence which is so very
cautious and long-sighted that it is seldom exercised at all, lest
its owner should be imposed upon, and so wounded in his self-love, be
real charity or a worldly counterfeit, I leave to wiser heads than
mine to determine. But if those two fellows were to commit a burglary
to-morrow, my opinion of this action would be equally high."

Besides which, all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose, I
had endeavoured to say in it.

‘Yes,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

‘Very good; is it not?’

The morning came: it was a pleasant sight to behold Mr. Tupman in full
brigand’s costume, with a very tight jacket, sitting like a pincushion
over his back and shoulders, the upper portion of his legs incased in
the velvet shorts, and the lower part thereof swathed in the complicated
bandages to which all brigands are peculiarly attached. It was pleasing
to see his open and ingenuous countenance, well mustachioed and corked,
looking out from an open shirt collar; and to contemplate the sugar-loaf
hat, decorated with ribbons of all colours, which he was compelled to
carry on his knee, inasmuch as no known conveyance with a top to it,
would admit of any man’s carrying it between his head and the roof.
Equally humorous and agreeable was the appearance of Mr. Snodgrass in
blue satin trunks and cloak, white silk tights and shoes, and Grecian
helmet, which everybody knows (and if they do not, Mr. Solomon Lucas
did) to have been the regular, authentic, everyday costume of a
troubadour, from the earliest ages down to the time of their final
disappearance from the face of the earth. All this was pleasant, but
this was as nothing compared with the shouting of the populace when the
carriage drew up, behind Mr. Pott’s chariot, which chariot itself drew
up at Mr. Pott’s door, which door itself opened, and displayed the great
Pott accoutred as a Russian officer of justice, with a tremendous knout
in his hand--tastefully typical of the stern and mighty power of the
Eatanswill _Gazette_, and the fearful lashings it bestowed on public
offenders.

It may have been that in all this there were mutterings of an awakened
feeling in his breast, however selfishly aroused by his position of
disadvantage, in comparison with what she might have made his life. But
he silenced the distant thunder with the rolling of his sea of pride.
He would bear nothing but his pride. And in his pride, a heap of
inconsistency, and misery, and self-inflicted torment, he hated her.

Nothing on the second-floor landing, but cobwebs above and bits of broken
plaster below, cracked off from the ceiling.  Benjamin’s mother was not a
bit out of breath, and looked all ready to go to the top of the monument
if necessary.  The faint scraping sound had got a little clearer still;
but Trottle was no nearer to guessing what it might be, than when he
first heard it in the parlour downstairs.

‘An honest man!’ cried Squeers, with a sneer.

‘There are only four of us, ‘Tilda,’ said Miss Squeers, looking slyly at
Nicholas; ‘so we had better go partners, two against two.’

The royalist casualties were comparatively trifling, and the rebel loss
fell infinitely short of what might have been expected from a _déroute_
so complete as that which followed the loss of their favourite position.
As the greater number of the insurgents were cut down dispersing in the
pursuit, the amount could not be correctly estimated. Probably three or
four hundred might have been slain. One of their favourite generals, a
church-militant leader, was included in the casualties of the day,
for Father Clinch of Enniscorthy was killed while retreating after the
action.

“Miss Havisham?”

‘Go where?’ retorted Peg. ‘I ain’t doing any harm here, am I?’

"Why it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put in
the blessed infants' Daffy when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble," replied
Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and
glass. "It's gin."

‘It’s quite new to me,’ said Lizzie, ‘to be visited by a lady so nearly
of my own age, and so pretty, as you. It’s a pleasure to me to look at
you.’

John Chivery backed to the door.

At dinner it was just the same; and after dinner too; though wine was
drunk in abundance, and various rich meats eaten. At nine o’clock it was
still the same. There being a lamp in the carriage, he swore they would
take a pack of cards, and a bottle of wine; and with these things under
his cloak, went down to the door.

“At six this evening.”

“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”

It was an ancient, dark-looking room, with oaken wainscoting, a sanded
floor, and a high mantel-piece. The walls were ornamented with three or
four old coloured prints in black frames, each print representing a
naval engagement, with a couple of men-of-war banging away at each
other most vigorously, while another vessel or two were blowing up in
the distance, and the foreground presented a miscellaneous collection
of broken masts and blue legs sticking up out of the water. Depending
from the ceiling in the centre of the room, were a gas-light and
bell-pull; on each side were three or four long narrow tables, behind
which was a thickly-planted row of those slippery, shiny-looking wooden
chairs, peculiar to hostelries of this description. The monotonous
appearance of the sanded boards was relieved by an occasional spittoon;
and a triangular pile of those useful articles adorned the two upper
corners of the apartment.

From bad to worse has been the rapid declension of the empire since
the fatal day of the fatal catastrophe which is the subject of this
pitiable historical record. Competition, too faint for success, having
ceased, steam and smoke have everywhere usurped the once blooming
soil. From them, we are now a land of clouds,--murky clouds, to which
those of Aristophanes are but fanciful and brilliant exhalations.
Intersected by railroads, the iron age is restored, and the golden has
vanished for ever. The commonweal revolves on the axes of tramwheels and
trains; the reins of government are utterly relaxed; and the country,
saddled with taxes and burthens, can no longer afford its inhabitants
a single morsel. Engineers and speculators are bringing us to a dead
level everywhere; and a republic is the inevitable consequence. For
our parts, with the stomach of a horse, and loving beyond measure a
sound horse-laugh, emigration is our immediate purpose. By Strasburg
and Bologna will we wend our way, and endeavour to fathom the
sausage-wonder; and thence, if no better may be, we shall sail for the
Houyhnhnms' Land, (to the south of Lewin's and Nuyt's Land, and the west
of Maelsuyker's Isle), and, at all events, make our finale like Trojans,
by trusting to the horse!

‘Aye!’ said Tom, ‘so should I, yesterday. Good night!’

“Certainly not,” replied the matron. “Why are we brought here to answer
to such nonsense as this?”

He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet,
with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table
by his side. His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed
in thought, he bit his long black nails, he disclosed among his
toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog’s or rat’s.

I was born on the Queen's highway, but it was the King's at that time.  A
doctor was fetched to my own mother by my own father, when it took place
on a common; and in consequence of his being a very kind gentleman, and
accepting no fee but a tea-tray, I was named Doctor, out of gratitude and
compliment to him.  There you have me.  Doctor Marigold.

The universal joy may be imagined. Even the grave fairy of the North
smiled with pleasure and delight, and, as she kissed her pretty
god-daughter, she took the girl's hand and pressed it against her own
heart.

"That's not precisely what I meant, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, shaking
his head, with a slight smile.

‘Come, come!’ said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder.
‘You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you
safe and well.’

“My dear Caddy,” said I, “let us be friends from this time, and let
us often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right
way through them.” Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in
my old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her, and I would not
have objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller
consideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law.

‘I beg your pardon, my dear Jane,’ said my mother, ‘but are you quite
sure--I am certain you’ll excuse me, my dear Jane--that you understand
Davy?’

“Done to your done, and double done!” says he.  “Have you got a bit of
supper in the house?”

‘Is that your fan, my love?’ asked Mr Sparkler, picking up one and
presenting it.

‘Well?  I’ll try,’ returned the reluctant whelp, ‘if it isn’t a long un.’

_"Now then, sir," said Sam, "off vith you, and show 'em
    how to do it"_                                                  18

“The little word?” said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful
beauty—“the one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?”

‘The following horrid circumstances,’ relates the historian, ‘attended
the murder of George Crawford and his grandchild, a girl of only
fourteen years of age. He had formerly served in the 5th Dragoons,
retired on a pension, and was permanent sergeant in Captain Taylor’s
corps of yeoman cavalry. He, his wife, and grand-daughter were stopped
by a party of the rebels, as they were endeavouring to escape, and were
reproached with the appellation of heretics because they were of the
Protestant religion. One of them struck his wife with a musket, and
another gave her a stab of a pike in the back, with an intent of
murdering her. The husband, having endeavoured to save her, was knocked
down, and received several blows of a firelock, which disabled him from
making his escape. While they were disputing whether they should kill
them, his wife stole behind a hedge and concealed herself. They then
massacred her husband with pikes; and her grand-daughter having thrown
herself on his body to protect him, received so many wounds that she
instantly expired.

The retort so tickled Joey Ladle that he grunted forth a laugh and
delivered it again, grunting forth another laugh after the second edition
of "improvement in you."

‘Nothing but taking him in the very act of eloping, will convince the
old lady, sir,’ replied Job.

The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror.  She
had no fear of the dear old grandfather, in whose love for her this
disease of the brain had been engendered; but the man she had seen that
night, wrapt in the game of chance, lurking in her room, and counting
the money by the glimmering light, seemed like another creature in his
shape, a monstrous distortion of his image, a something to recoil from,
and be the more afraid of, because it bore a likeness to him, and kept
close about her, as he did.  She could scarcely connect her own
affectionate companion, save by his loss, with this old man, so like
yet so unlike him.  She had wept to see him dull and quiet.  How much
greater cause she had for weeping now!

‘The author stated, that, having long turned his attention to the moral
and social condition of these interesting animals, he had been induced to
visit an exhibition in Regent-street, London, commonly known by the
designation of “The Industrious Fleas.”  He had there seen many fleas,
occupied certainly in various pursuits and avocations, but occupied, he
was bound to add, in a manner which no man of well-regulated mind could
fail to regard with sorrow and regret.  One flea, reduced to the level of
a beast of burden, was drawing about a miniature gig, containing a
particularly small effigy of His Grace the Duke of Wellington; while
another was staggering beneath the weight of a golden model of his great
adversary Napoleon Bonaparte.  Some, brought up as mountebanks and
ballet-dancers, were performing a figure-dance (he regretted to observe,
that, of the fleas so employed, several were females); others were in
training, in a small card-board box, for pedestrians,—mere sporting
characters—and two were actually engaged in the cold-blooded and
barbarous occupation of duelling; a pursuit from which humanity recoiled
with horror and disgust.  He suggested that measures should be
immediately taken to employ the labour of these fleas as part and parcel
of the productive power of the country, which might easily be done by the
establishment among them of infant schools and houses of industry, in
which a system of virtuous education, based upon sound principles, should
be observed, and moral precepts strictly inculcated.  He proposed that
every flea who presumed to exhibit, for hire, music, or dancing, or any
species of theatrical entertainment, without a licence, should be
considered a vagabond, and treated accordingly; in which respect he only
placed him upon a level with the rest of mankind.  He would further
suggest that their labour should be placed under the control and
regulation of the state, who should set apart from the profits, a fund
for the support of superannuated or disabled fleas, their widows and
orphans.  With this view, he proposed that liberal premiums should be
offered for the three best designs for a general almshouse; from which—as
insect architecture was well known to be in a very advanced and perfect
state—we might possibly derive many valuable hints for the improvement of
our metropolitan universities, national galleries, and other public
edifices.

‘You can’t be heard by counsel, sir,’ returned Bella. ‘You must speak
for yourself. Confess instantly!’

‘Then you had better hear them.’ And so read them aloud, in an official
manner.

‘Worldly?’ I cried.  ‘Worldly?’

Mr Lammle plunged into his whiskers for reflection, and came out
hopeless: ‘No; as adventurers we are obliged to play rash games for
chances of high winnings, and there has been a run of luck against us.’

"How did you find the cold pie, George?"

Utter silence.

“You know now, don’t you, that even a poor monotonous chorister and
grinder of music—in his niche—may be troubled with some stray sort of
ambition, aspiration, restlessness, dissatisfaction, what shall we call
it?”

“As to Pip, he’s going up town,” said Joe.

‘I should say, three pound ten was plenty,’ said Mr. Limbkins.

‘Let me answer with another question. Tell me, Mr Dorrit, what surprise
would be the most unlooked for and the most acceptable to you. Do not be
afraid to imagine it, or to say what it would be.’

“Do you really?” returned Mr. Skimpole in his easy light vein. “But
that’s taking trouble, surely. And why should you take trouble? Here
am I, content to receive things childishly as they fall out, and I
never take trouble! I come down here, for instance, and I find a
mighty potentate exacting homage. Very well! I say ‘Mighty potentate,
here IS my homage! It’s easier to give it than to withhold it. Here
it is. If you have anything of an agreeable nature to show me, I
shall be happy to see it; if you have anything of an agreeable nature
to give me, I shall be happy to accept it.’ Mighty potentate replies
in effect, ‘This is a sensible fellow. I find him accord with my
digestion and my bilious system. He doesn’t impose upon me the
necessity of rolling myself up like a hedgehog with my points
outward. I expand, I open, I turn my silver lining outward like
Milton’s cloud, and it’s more agreeable to both of us.’ That’s my
view of such things, speaking as a child!”

The lunch was handsomely served, with a profusion of rich glass plate,
and china; which seemed to denote that eating and drinking on a showy
scale formed no unimportant item in the business of the Anglo-Bengalee
Directorship. As it proceeded, the Medical Officer grew more and more
joyous and red-faced, insomuch that every mouthful he ate, and every
drop of wine he swallowed, seemed to impart new lustre to his eyes, and
to light up new sparks in his nose and forehead.

“By Jove!” exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping
short. “I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,
that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!”

“I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.
Bumble,” said the undertaker.

‘Now, I pass to sick and deranged impressions; they are so strong, that
I rely upon them; but there are spaces between them that I know nothing
about, and they are not pervaded by any idea of time.

Perched on the stool with his hat cocked on his head and one of his legs
dangling, the youth of Fledgeby hardly contrasted to advantage with the
age of the Jewish man as he stood with his bare head bowed, and his eyes
(which he only raised in speaking) on the ground. His clothing was worn
down to the rusty hue of the hat in the entry, but though he looked
shabby he did not look mean. Now, Fledgeby, though not shabby, did look
mean.

‘Well,’ said the same gentleman, after a pause, ‘wot’s to be
done--anything? Is it only a small crack, or a out-and-out smash? A
break-up of the constitootion is it?--werry good. Then Mr. Tom Tix,
esk-vire, you must inform your angel wife and lovely family as you won’t
sleep at home for three nights to come, along of being in possession
here. Wot’s the good of the lady a fretting herself?’ continued Mr
Scaley, as Madame Mantalini sobbed. ‘A good half of wot’s here isn’t
paid for, I des-say, and wot a consolation oughtn’t that to be to her
feelings!’

These are my chief credentials as the Uncommercial Traveller.

_Scro._ I am much obliged, but I think a night of unbroken rest would be
more conducive to that end.

The bishop, nodding assent, was then conducted in solemn silence into
the wardrobe of the castle, where the obsequious attendants soon
arrayed him in a dress fit for a bishop to sit with the king at supper
in. It was not such unpretending costume as that in which bishops are
at present apparelled; but robes of the tinctured colours of the East,
which were more apt to remind both the wearer and the beholders of
mundane pomps and vanities, than of the humility and simplicity of
Christianity. The alb was of most dazzling white, the dalmatica of
gold tissue, the stole was embroidered with precious stones, and the
chasuble, of purple velvet wrought with orfraise, was also studded with
costly orient gems.

Mrs Varden was delighted beyond measure.

While I spoke Alan kept his eyes fixed on mine, reading through
them, as I knew, into my mind.  When I had finished he turned his
gaze away satisfied, and answered very quietly, "Yes, that was it."
Then he went back to the fireplace, rested his arm against the high
mantelpiece above it, and leaning his forehead on his arm, remained
silently looking into the fire.  I could see by his bent brow and
compressed lips that he was engaged upon some earnest train of
thought or reasoning, and I stood waiting--worried, puzzled,
curious, but above all things, pitiful, and oh! longing so
intensely to help him if I could.  Presently he straightened
himself a little, and addressed me more in his ordinary tone of
voice, though without looking round.  "So I hear they have changed
your room."

"Tom Smart, gentlemen, had always been very much attached to the public
line. It had long been his ambition to stand in a bar of his own, in a
green coat, knee-cords and tops. He had a great notion of taking the
chair at convivial dinners, and he had often thought how well he could
preside in a room of his own in the talking way, and what a capital
example he could set to his customers in the drinking department. All
these things passed rapidly through Tom's mind as he sat drinking the
hot punch by the roaring fire, and he felt very justly and properly
indignant that the tall man should be in a fair way of keeping such an
excellent house, while he, Tom Smart, was as far off from it as ever.
So, after deliberating over the two last tumblers, whether he hadn't a
perfect right to pick a quarrel with the tall man for having contrived
to get into the good graces of the buxom widow, Tom Smart at last
arrived at the satisfactory conclusion that he was a very ill-used and
persecuted individual, and had better go to bed.

‘Don’t say that,’ urged the Secretary.

“Ten o’clock, sir.”

The boy shook his hair from his eyes to look at him for a moment, and
then, twisting round his legs and wrestling with him, broke again into
his repetition of “You let me go, will you? I want to find the woman.”

“There’s not much to choose between your two states,” says the
visitor in a key too low for the old man’s dull hearing as he looks
from him to the old woman and back again. “I say!” in a louder voice.

‘Thank’ee, sir,’ said the Boots, and away he went.

‘I am pledged,’ he answered her, preserving his steady look, ‘to say no
more.  Do you think you understand me?’

‘If you please, sir, would you have the goodness to walk in, and speak
to Miss Dartle?’

This was addressed to the gipsy, who crawled into the low tent on all
fours, and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cash-box,
which the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person.

Again the light!  Distinct and ruddy; kindled, he knew, to give him
welcome, and to speed him home.  He beckoned with his hand, and waved his
hat, and cheered out, loud, as if the light were they, and they could see
and hear him, as he dashed towards them through the mud and mire,
triumphantly.

‘Hush! hush!’ interrupted Mr. Percy Noakes, who was one of the very few
by whom this dialogue had been overheard. ‘Hush!—pray, silence for the
duet.’

I had previously been presented by my aunt, and had been courteously
received. He now said:

We went into the house by a side door--the great front entrance had two
chains across it outside--and the first thing I noticed was that the
passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.
She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,
and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.

Embassy.

"How fast you walk!" said he. "My legs are pretty long, but you've given
'em quite a job."

Talking on in this strain, as fast as he could, to prevent any friendly
remonstrances from the collector of the subscription on the large amount
of his donation, Mr. Cheeryble led Nicholas, equally astonished and
affected by what he had seen and heard in this short space, to the
half-opened door of another room.

‘No!’

The Captain was frightened to dead “If you would Ma’am,” he said with
submission, “it would oblige me. I can’t keep my money very well. It
pays itself out. I should take it kind if you’d comply.”

‘His mother.’

"No, no, that little girl."

‘Mr. Peggotty,’ he said, ‘you are a thoroughly good fellow, and deserve
to be as happy as you are tonight. My hand upon it! Ham, I give you
joy, my boy. My hand upon that, too! Daisy, stir the fire, and make it a
brisk one! and Mr. Peggotty, unless you can induce your gentle niece to
come back (for whom I vacate this seat in the corner), I shall go.
Any gap at your fireside on such a night--such a gap least of all--I
wouldn’t make, for the wealth of the Indies!’

“That’s a dear good boy! Eddy, let us be courageous. Let us change to
brother and sister from this day forth.”

The event, meanwhile, had exercised a very salutary influence on the
maiden lady. Through very fear of betraying herself to the curious
eyes of her former companions and gossips, she weaned herself from all
intercourse with them, and acquired a taste for more refined pleasures
in the circle of Dr. Falcon's family. She continued, indeed, rather too
fond of all the tittle-tattle of the town; but then she thought of her
own weakness, and judged more charitably that of others. She became
so indulgent, so modest, nay, so humble, that the doctor and his wife
were completely amazed. The change of circumstances and society,--the
heroic resolution by which she had divested herself of a part of her
property,--the assurance of the doctor that she was still rich enough
to live at her ease,--all this had effected so singular a change in
her character, that she seemed to live quite in a new world. She even
abandoned all her usurious dealings, which, to be sure, she would have
found it difficult to continue in her present seclusion.

‘I say, Johnson,’ remonstrated Mr. Folair, suddenly losing all his
dignity, ‘none of that, you know. No tricks with a gentleman’s
wardrobe.’

Mr. Brownlow’s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting
perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he
suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.

‘So they used to say in that part of the country I come from,’ observed
Peg, complacently, ‘but I think oil’s better.’

‘I traced Mesheck, by means of this green parrot on a stand, to
Cheltenham, to Birmingham, to Liverpool, to the Atlantic Ocean.  At
Liverpool he was too many for me.  He had gone to the United States, and
I gave up all thoughts of Mesheck, and likewise of his—Carpet Bag.

“So you have never sent me to Coventry after all!” said the lady,
laughing, as our fellows swarmed up the wall to shake hands with her.
“Are you never going to do it?”

The Blind Girl broke away from her; and, throwing herself upon her
knees before him, took the grey head to her breast.

With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling
an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which
opened close at Mr. Bumble’s feet, and caused that gentleman to
retire several paces backward, with great precipitation.

Mrs. Gibbs seemed satisfied, and the conversation on Mr. Paine's offer
was resumed.

‘Why, so do I perhaps,’ returned the client quietly.  ‘What of that!  Are
you men of the world, and did you never hear of a woman changing her
mind?’

“When did he come here?” I asked the woman.

"I believe it does," said Mr. Pickwick.

“No, guardian,” I returned, fearful of the light that dimly broke
upon me. “Nor do I know yet.”

Such an authority was indisputable. Mrs. Tuggs paid a week’s rent in
advance, and took the lodgings for a month. In an hour’s time, the
family were seated at tea in their new abode.

Child's Book of Nature, by Hooker.

We shall do nothing with it on this side. Pirates are producing their
own wretched versions in all directions, thus (as Wills would say)
anticipating and glutting "the market." I registered one play as the
property of Ticknor and Fields, American citizens. But, besides that the
law on the point is extremely doubtful, the manager of the Museum
Theatre, Boston, instantly announced his version. (You may suppose what
it is and how it is done, when I tell you that it was playing within ten
days of the arrival out of the Christmas number.) Thereupon, Ticknor and
Fields gave him notice that he mustn't play it. Unto which he replied,
that he meant to play it and would play it. Of course he knew very well
that if an injunction were applied for against him, there would be an
immediate howl against my persecution of an innocent, and he played it.
Then the noble host of pirates rushed in, and it is being done, in some
mangled form or other, everywhere.

"I never dance," said I.

“Mr. Guppy” is all the information the card yields.

CHAPTER XLIV

Again the Captain clapped his hand to his head, on which the hard
glazed hat was not, and looked discomfited. But at this instant a most
remarkable phenomenon occurred. The door opening, without any note of
preparation, and apparently of itself, the hard glazed hat in question
skimmed into the room like a bird, and alighted heavily at the
Captain’s feet. The door then shut as violently as it had opened, and
nothing ensued in explanation of the prodigy.

‘Well, well! Say it for goodness’ sake,’ returned the young lady.

John Willet, left alone in his dismantled bar, continued to sit staring
about him; awake as to his eyes, certainly, but with all his powers of
reason and reflection in a sound and dreamless sleep. He looked round
upon the room which had been for years, and was within an hour ago, the
pride of his heart; and not a muscle of his face was moved. The night,
without, looked black and cold through the dreary gaps in the casement;
the precious liquids, now nearly leaked away, dripped with a hollow
sound upon the floor; the Maypole peered ruefully in through the broken
window, like the bowsprit of a wrecked ship; the ground might have
been the bottom of the sea, it was so strewn with precious fragments.
Currents of air rushed in, as the old doors jarred and creaked upon
their hinges; the candles flickered and guttered down, and made long
winding-sheets; the cheery deep-red curtains flapped and fluttered idly
in the wind; even the stout Dutch kegs, overthrown and lying empty in
dark corners, seemed the mere husks of good fellows whose jollity had
departed, and who could kindle with a friendly glow no more. John saw
this desolation, and yet saw it not. He was perfectly contented to sit
there, staring at it, and felt no more indignation or discomfort in his
bonds than if they had been robes of honour. So far as he was personally
concerned, old Time lay snoring, and the world stood still.

The gentleman with the beefsteak collar made a demonstration to
interrupt my retreat, and in return received a box on the ear that sent
him halfway down the kitchen stairs.

The ship was fragrant with flowers.  Something of the old Mexican passion
for flowers may have gradually passed into North America, where flowers
are luxuriously grown, and tastefully combined in the richest profusion;
but, be that as it may, such gorgeous farewells in flowers had come on
board, that the small officer’s cabin on deck, which I tenanted, bloomed
over into the adjacent scuppers, and banks of other flowers that it
couldn’t hold made a garden of the unoccupied tables in the passengers’
saloon.  These delicious scents of the shore, mingling with the fresh
airs of the sea, made the atmosphere a dreamy, an enchanting one.  And
so, with the watch aloft setting all the sails, and with the screw below
revolving at a mighty rate, and occasionally giving the ship an angry
shake for resisting, I fell into my idlest ways, and lost myself.

The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale
with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he
looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in
the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle
spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the
world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.

I think, as Mrs. Micawber sat at the back of the coach, with the
children, and I stood in the road looking wistfully at them, a mist
cleared from her eyes, and she saw what a little creature I really was.
I think so, because she beckoned to me to climb up, with quite a new and
motherly expression in her face, and put her arm round my neck, and gave
me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy. I had barely
time to get down again before the coach started, and I could hardly see
the family for the handkerchiefs they waved. It was gone in a minute.
The Orfling and I stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle
of the road, and then shook hands and said good-bye; she going back,
I suppose, to St. Luke’s workhouse, as I went to begin my weary day at
Murdstone and Grinby’s.

‘Very good,’ he replied, crossing his legs again, for he had made as
though he would rise and walk to the door. ‘As you please, widow. His
presence is not necessary that I know of. But both he and I must live;
to live, we must eat and drink; to eat and drink, we must have money:--I
say no more.’

“I thank Heaven!” said Harriet. “For the sake of John.”

She was happy and useful, was prospering as she had hoped. That was all
she told me of herself. The rest referred to me.

“To say who it is.  It is always done, in order that some reason may be
discovered for the suicide—if suicide it was.  I make no doubt he was
the man who came to see you at our house last night.  It is very sad, I
know.”  He made pauses between each little clause, in order to try and
bring back her senses; which he feared were wandering—so wild and sad
was her look.

Mr Pecksniff cast him off, as Saint George might have repudiated the
Dragon in that animal’s last moments, and said:

Your announcement of "The Working Man's Life" had attracted my attention
by reason of the title, which had a great interest for me.[35] I hardly
know if there is something wanting to my fancy in a certain genuine
simple air I had looked for in the first part. But there is great
promise in it, and I shall be earnest to know how it proceeds.

“Our captain. The captain we know of. Captain Hawdon.”

‘Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?’ demanded
Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend.

“Speak to her kindly,” said the young lady to her companion. “Poor
creature! She seems to need it.”

“Pretty well so, Mr. Tulkinghorn; I don’t complain.”

‘It’s very late,’ said the uneasy child.  ‘I wish we had gone before.
What will they think of us!  It will be two o’clock by the time we get
back.  What would it cost, sir, if we stopped here?’

And then he told them how, resolved to probe this Pecksniff, and to
prove the constancy and truth of Mary (to himself no less than
Martin), he had conceived and entered on his plan; and how, beneath her
gentleness and patience, he had softened more and more; still more and
more beneath the goodness and simplicity, the honour and the manly faith
of Tom. And when he spoke of Tom, he said God bless him; and the tears
were in his eyes; for he said that Tom, mistrusted and disliked by him
at first, had come like summer rain upon his heart; and had disposed it
to believe in better things. And Martin took him by the hand, and Mary
too, and John, his old friend, stoutly too; and Mark, and Mrs Lupin,
and his sister, little Ruth. And peace of mind, deep, tranquil peace of
mind, was in Tom’s heart.

Now, Mrs. Nickleby was not the sort of person to be told anything in
a hurry, or rather to comprehend anything of peculiar delicacy or
importance on a short notice. Wherefore, although the good lady had been
subjected to a full hour’s preparation by little Miss La Creevy, and was
now addressed in most lucid terms both by Nicholas and his sister, she
was in a state of singular bewilderment and confusion, and could by no
means be made to comprehend the necessity of such hurried proceedings.

Faithfully yours.

‘Why, it’s Nancy!’ exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the
first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.

“Sergeant,” the lawyer proceeds in his dry passionless manner, far
more hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence, “make
up your mind while I speak to you, for this is final. After I have
finished speaking I have closed the subject, and I won’t re-open it.
Understand that. You can leave here, for a few days, what you say you
have brought here if you choose; you can take it away at once if you
choose. In case you choose to leave it here, I can do this for you—I
can replace this matter on its old footing, and I can go so far
besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet
shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded
against to the utmost, that your means shall be exhausted before the
creditor looks to his. This is in fact all but freeing him. Have you
decided?”

"Dear, dear! I don't know, ma'am," said Charlotte, "unless we send for
the police officers."

“Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,” replied Mrs.
Maylie.

IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON.

[Illustration: My first fall in life.]

You heard of his going to execution, evidently supposing the procession
to be a party detached in pursuit of something to kill or eat? It was
very affecting. And also of his bolting a blue-eyed kitten, and making
me acquainted with the circumstance by his agonies of remorse (or
indigestion)?

"We'll have you put to rights here," said the old gentleman, "and then
I'll introduce you to the people in the parlour. Emma, bring out the
cherry brandy; now, Jane, a needle and thread here; towels and water,
Mary. Come, girls, bustle about."

Consternation was at its height in the castle of Shurland--a caitiff had
dared to disobey the Baron! and--the Baron had called for his boots!

“Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him
down dead.

“We’re all sons of Ma’s, my dear,” said Mr. Tetterby, “jointly with
Pa’s.”

‘That would be an excellent plan,’ said Brass, ‘if anybody would be--’
and here he looked very hard at Mr Swiveller--‘would be kind, and
friendly, and generous enough, to undertake it.  I dare say it would
not be anything like as disagreeable as one supposes.’

He smoothed the boy’s hair—looking at her fixedly the while, and shook
his head.

I sprang up, and the skeleton sprang up also.  I then heard a plaintive
voice saying, “Where am I?  What is become of me?” and, looking hard in
that direction, perceived the ghost of Master B.

Mr Tappertit looked immensely big at a quartern loaf on the table, and
breathed hard.

Now, the tree is decorated with bright merriment, and song, and dance,
and cheerfulness.  And they are welcome.  Innocent and welcome be they
ever held, beneath the branches of the Christmas Tree, which cast no
gloomy shadow!  But, as it sinks into the ground, I hear a whisper going
through the leaves.  “This, in commemoration of the law of love and
kindness, mercy and compassion.  This, in remembrance of Me!”

As the family had no visitors that day, its four members dined alone
together. He conducted Mrs General to the seat at his right hand with
immense ceremony; and Little Dorrit could not but notice as she followed
with her uncle, both that he was again elaborately dressed, and that his
manner towards Mrs General was very particular. The perfect formation of
that accomplished lady’s surface rendered it difficult to displace an
atom of its genteel glaze, but Little Dorrit thought she descried a
slight thaw of triumph in a corner of her frosty eye.

“Nothing could save him,” cried the girl. “If I told others what I have
told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is
the boldest, and has been so cruel!”

‘No!’ returned Quilp.

‘Got over!’ repeated Fanny, with immeasurable scorn.

‘Now, you know what a verb is?’

‘In a general way that’s missing his tip,’ Mr. E. W. B. Childers
answered.

‘Then, tell Mr. Charles I want to see him.’

Under this provocation, Mr. Smallweed’s favourite adjective of
disparagement is so close to his tongue that he begins the words “my
dear friend” with the monosyllable “brim,” thus converting the
possessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in
his speech. Once past this difficulty, however, he exhorts his dear
friend in the tenderest manner not to be rash, but to do what so
eminent a gentleman requires, and to do it with a good grace,
confident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable. Mr.
Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence, as, “You are the
best judge of your own interest, sergeant.” “Take care you do no harm
by this.” “Please yourself, please yourself.” “If you know what you
mean, that’s quite enough.” These he utters with an appearance of
perfect indifference as he looks over the papers on his table and
prepares to write a letter.

I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.
Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving
crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his
employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something
like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.

“They are still up to it, sir,” says Mr. Guppy, “still taking stock,
still examining papers, still going over the heaps and heaps of
rubbish. At this rate they’ll be at it these seven years.”

Railway station.  ‘Lunch or dinner, ladies and gentlemen.  Plenty of time
for Paris.  Plenty of time!’  Large hall, long counter, long strips of
dining-table, bottles of wine, plates of meat, roast chickens, little
loaves of bread, basins of soup, little caraffes of brandy, cakes, and
fruit.  Comfortably restored from these resources, I begin to fly again.

‘Thank’ee.’ Mr. Winkle emptied his glass, and placed the bottle on the
coach-box, by his side.

“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when we may
meet again, and I don’t like good-bye. Say good-night!”

‘I don’t know,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, with equal carelessness. ‘It
smells, I think, like milk-punch.’

“My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.”

The dolls’ dressmaker sat with her attitude unchanged, eyeing the door
by which he had departed, until Lizzie pushed her bench aside and sat
down near her. Then, eyeing Lizzie as she had previously eyed Bradley
and the door, Miss Wren chopped that very sudden and keen chop in which
her jaws sometimes indulged, leaned back in her chair with folded arms,
and thus expressed herself:

‘Stop, stop! don’t take him away! For Heaven’s sake stop a moment!’
cried the new comer, breathless with haste.

I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father, and
began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to anybody
else there. I was so curious to know that I made up my mind to have it
out with Mr. Peggotty.

‘There is only one phenomenon, sir,’ replied Mr. Crummles impressively,
‘and that’s a girl.’

‘Mas’r Davy,’ he said, when we had shaken hands, ‘I giv Em’ly your
letter, sir, and she writ this heer; and begged of me fur to ask you
to read it, and if you see no hurt in’t, to be so kind as take charge
on’t.’

Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short
absence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence
that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the
boys were in the front one. Beckoning the man to follow him, he led
the way upstairs.

"Too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,
    Too like the lightning, which does cease to be
    Ere one can say, It lightens."

At the offices in the City, the ground-glass windows are made more dim
by shutters; and while the lighted lamps upon the desks are half
extinguished by the day that wanders in, the day is half extinguished
by the lamps, and an unusual gloom prevails. There is not much business
done. The clerks are indisposed to work; and they make assignations to
eat chops in the afternoon, and go up the river. Perch, the messenger,
stays long upon his errands; and finds himself in bars of
public-houses, invited thither by friends, and holding forth on the
uncertainty of human affairs. He goes home to Ball’s Pond earlier in
the evening than usual, and treats Mrs Perch to a veal cutlet and
Scotch ale. Mr Carker the Manager treats no one; neither is he treated;
but alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day; and it would seem
that there is something gone from Mr Carker’s path—some obstacle
removed—which clears his way before him.

"She died a woman," said the Ghost, "and had, as I think,
children."

He came back after a very short interval indeed.

‘Please to light the candle, Flintwinch,’ Mrs Clennam was saying,
apparently wishing to draw him back into their usual tone. ‘It is nearly
time for tea. Little Dorrit is coming, and will find me in the dark.’

Miss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a
general curtsy to us.

Now whether Mr Pecksniff had been listening--which in one of his
character appears impossible; or divined almost by inspiration what the
matter was--which, in a man of his sagacity is far more probable; or
happened by sheer good fortune to find himself in exactly the
right place, at precisely the right time--which, under the special
guardianship in which he lived might very reasonably happen; it is quite
certain that at the moment when the sisters came together in their own
room, he appeared at the chamber door. And a marvellous contrast it
was--they so heated, noisy, and vehement; he so calm, so self-possessed,
so cool and full of peace, that not a hair upon his head was stirred.

BEHOLD me on my way to an Emigrant Ship, on a hot morning early in June.
My road lies through that part of London generally known to the initiated
as ‘Down by the Docks.’  Down by the Docks, is home to a good many
people—to too many, if I may judge from the overflow of local population
in the streets—but my nose insinuates that the number to whom it is Sweet
Home might be easily counted.  Down by the Docks, is a region I would
choose as my point of embarkation aboard ship if I were an emigrant.  It
would present my intention to me in such a sensible light; it would show
me so many things to be run away from.

END OF ACT I.

"It must be a mixed motive, I think," said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his
head and smiling incredulously.

Guster is minding the shop, for the ’prentices take tea in the
kitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker’s two
daughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two
second-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two
’prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely
awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won’t
grow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.

"All the symptoms aggerawated," replied Mr. Weller, shaking his
head. "But wot's that, you're a doin' of? Pursuit of knowledge under
difficulties, Sammy?"

“That mistake?”

"As good as gold and better," replied his father. "I think, wife, the
child gets thoughtful, sitting at home so much. He told me, coming home,
that he hoped the people in church who saw he was a cripple, would be
pleased to remember on Christmas day who it was who made the lame to
walk."

She would have run and thrown her arms about his neck if she had dared;
but as she did not dare, she glanced with thankful eyes towards him, as
he sat musing; sometimes bestowing an uneasy glance on her, but, for
the most part, watching Paul, who walked about the room with the
new-blown dignity of having let young Gay have the money.

"'More'--?"

"'Cobbs, how should you spell Norah, if you was asked?' and then begun
cutting it in print, all over the fence.

Faithfully yours always.

The Jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could
have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude, and,
seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant's head. But
Charley Bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly
terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full
at that young gentleman.

“I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And so the little Jell—I
had my doubts about ’em—are in a—oh, Lord, yes, it’s easterly!”
said Mr. Jarndyce.

‘Room for the eldest son of the Emperor of Roosher, gen’l’men!’ cried
another fellow.

“Ay, that she would,” rejoined the other; “she had a merry heart. A
many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as
waxwork. My old eyes have seen them—ay, and those old hands touched
them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.”

Section C.  Anatomy and Medicine

The postillions resumed their proper attitudes, and away rattled the
chaise, Mr. Jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the
coach window.

‘I am a citizen of the world, ma’am,’ said the blind man, corking his
bottle, ‘and if I seem to conduct myself with freedom, it is therefore.
You wonder who I am, ma’am, and what has brought me here. Such
experience of human nature as I have, leads me to that conclusion,
without the aid of eyes by which to read the movements of your soul
as depicted in your feminine features. I will satisfy your curiosity
immediately, ma’am; immediately.’ With that he slapped his bottle on its
broad back, and having put it under his garment as before, crossed his
legs and folded his hands, and settled himself in his chair, previous to
proceeding any further.

Without considering, perhaps, whether there were any consequences to be
taken, I felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech.  It made an
impression on the boys, too, for there was a low stir among them, though
no one spoke a word.

“Which will be the prime of life,” observed Miss Tox.

Seaforth was in the seventh heaven; he retired to his room that night
as happy as if no such thing as a goblin had ever been heard of, and
personal chattels were as well fenced in by law as real property. Not
so Tom Ingoldsby: the mystery--for mystery there evidently was,--had
not only piqued his curiosity, but ruffled his temper. The watch of
the previous night had been unsuccessful, probably because it was
undisguised. Tonight he would "ensconce himself,"--not indeed "behind
the arras,"--for the little that remained was, as we have seen, nailed
to the wall,--but in a small closet which opened from one corner of the
room, and, by leaving the door ajar, would give its occupant a view of
all that might pass in the apartment. Here did the young ghost-hunter
take up a position, with a good stout sapling under his arm, a full
half-hour before Seaforth retired for the night. Not even his friend did
he let into his confidence, fully determined that if his plan did not
succeed, the failure should be attributed to himself alone.

The spinster uttered a loud shriek, and, throwing herself in a chair,
covered her face with her hands. Mr. Jingle crumpled up the licence,
and thrust it into his coat-pocket. The unwelcome visitors advanced
into the middle of the room.

We are expecting Stanfield on Thursday, and Peter Cunningham and his
wife on Monday. I would we were expecting you! This is as pretty and odd
a little French country house as could be found anywhere; and the
gardens are most beautiful.

Florence ascended the dusky staircase, trembling; and stopped, with her
conductor, at the drawing-room door. He opened it, without speaking,
and signed an entreaty to her to advance into the inner room, while he
remained there. Florence, after hesitating an instant, complied.

“Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay,” was at length arraigned.

(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr. Camilla.)

Little Em’ly didn’t care a bit. She saw me well enough; but instead of
turning round and calling after me, ran away laughing. This obliged me
to run after her, and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage
before I caught her.

My aunt was so exasperated by the coolness with which Miss Murdstone
looked about her, that I really believe she did not know what to do.  I
hastened to tell her who it was, and that Mr. Murdstone was following
behind, but it made no difference.  She glared at them as they entered
the room in a most terrible way.

“The airs the fellow gives himself!” said my informant, shaking her
head at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on
his tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage she was
rendering. “He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy! And he is
so condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might
suppose him the most virtuous of parents. Oh!” said the old lady,
apostrophizing him with infinite vehemence. “I could bite you!”

By a letter in a St. Louis paper of the ‘4th, we notice a terrible
    outrage at Burlington, Iowa.  A Mr. Bridgman having had a difficulty
    with a citizen of the place, Mr. Ross; a brother-in-law of the latter
    provided himself with one of Colt’s revolving pistols, met Mr. B. in
    the street, _and discharged the contents of five of the barrels at
    him_: _each shot taking effect_.  Mr. B., though horribly wounded,
    and dying, returned the fire, and killed Ross on the spot.’

‘Pardon me,’ returned Mrs Wilfer. ‘Not at all. Two of my daughters. R.
W., this is the gentleman who has taken your first-floor. He was so good
as to make an appointment for to-night, when you would be at home.’

“Not quite, sometimes, Mama?” said Edith.

Affery had so vivid a fear of his going stealthily up-stairs the moment
her back was turned, that after hurrying out of sight, she returned to
the gateway to peep at him. Seeing him still on the threshold, more out
of the house than in it, as if he had no love for darkness and no
desire to probe its mysteries, she flew into the next street, and sent a
message into the tavern to Mr Flintwinch, who came out directly. The
two returning together--the lady in advance, and Mr Flintwinch coming up
briskly behind, animated with the hope of shaking her before she could
get housed--saw the gentleman standing in the same place in the dark,
and heard the strong voice of Mrs Clennam calling from her room, ‘Who is
it? What is it? Why does no one answer? Who _is_ that, down there?’

"Faithfully yours,

I was so much dismayed by these words, and particularly by the
repetition of the last unknown one, which was a kind of rattle in his
throat, that I could make no answer; hereupon the old man, still holding
me by the hair, repeated:

Lives among the false loves, knowing
Just their peace and strife:
Bears the self-same look, but always
Has an inner life.
Only a true heart can find it,
True as it is true,
Only eyes as clear and tender
Look it through and through.

Even in the vernacular (observes Mr. Percy Fitzgerald), 'this master of
words [Charles Dickens] could be artistic; and it may fairly be asserted
that Mr. Weller's song to the coachmen is superior to anything of the kind
that has appeared since.' The two stanzas have been set to music, as a
humorous part-song, by Sir Frederick Bridge, Mus. Doc., M.V.O., the
organist of Westminster Abbey, who informs me that it was written some
years since, to celebrate a festive gathering in honour of Dr. Turpin (!),
Secretary of the College of Organists. 'It has had a very great success,'
says Sir Frederick, 'and is sung much in the North of England at
competitions of choirs. It is for men's voices. The humour of the words
never fails to make a great hit, and I hope the music does no harm. "The
Bishop's Coach" is set to a bit of old Plain-Chant, and I introduce a
Fugue at the words "Sure as eggs is eggs."'

[Illustration: IT WAS AGREED THAT MR. BATTENS "OUGHT TO TAKE IT UP," AND
MR. BATTENS WAS COMMUNICATED WITH ON THE SUBJECT--_Titbull's
Almshouses_]

‘Left the house early this morning, without the slightest previous
communication with me,’ replied Mr. Pickwick. ‘And is gone, I know not
where.’

MY DEAR SIR,

‘Oh! I see—not much fear of that;—well—“two human lives, you will cause
him to be removed to-night.” (He wants to start at once.) “Fear not to
do this on your responsibility: for to-morrow the absolute necessity of
the proceeding will be but too apparent. Remember: number nineteen. The
name is Trott. No delay; for life and death depend upon your
promptitude.” Passionate language, certainly. Shall I see him?’

In the course of the protracted consultation, a magnum of the forty-five
year old port-wine had been produced for the wetting of Mr. Bintrey's
legal whistle; but the more clearly he saw his way through the wine, the
more emphatically he did not see his way through the case; repeating as
often as he set his glass down empty.  "Mr. Wilding, No Thoroughfare.
Rest and be thankful."

Mr Pancks and he shook hands, and the former brought his employer a
letter or two to sign. Mr Pancks in shaking hands merely scratched his
eyebrow with his left forefinger and snorted once, but Clennam, who
understood him better now than of old, comprehended that he had almost
done for the evening and wished to say a word to him outside. Therefore,
when he had taken his leave of Mr Casby, and (which was a more difficult
process) of Flora, he sauntered in the neighbourhood on Mr Pancks’s line
of road.

‘I should not have supposed him to be very free with his money either,’
I observed.

She told him in a timid manner,--for he was very loud, hoarse, and
red-faced,--and besought him not to be angry, for they meant no harm,
and would go upon their way that moment.

Mr. Pickwick nodded assent, and coughed to attract the attention of the
young gentlemen behind the partition, who, having now relaxed their
minds by a little conversation among themselves, condescended to take
some notice of the stranger.

‘And that’s a fine thing to do, and manly too,’ said Nicholas, ‘though
it’s not exactly what we understand by “coming Yorkshire over us” in
London. Miss Squeers is stopping with you, you said in your note.’

‘Dolly!’ cried Joe. ‘Dolly!’

Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of
tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and
took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. “Ah! poultry,
poultry! You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the
fowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in store
for you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this
humble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr.
Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may I? _may_ I—?”

I offered her my hand in due time, and was accepted. How I despised the
sneers and banter of some of my friends who could not conceive the idea
of a marriage with fortune on one side, and none on the other, and yet
were endeavouring at the same time to effect an engagement of a similar
nature in their own favour! How I disregarded the gratuitous advice of
sundry of my officious relatives, who thought that all love had died
when their own gave up the ghost, and who sometimes prophesied truly
because they were always prognosticating evil!

“Here’s the woman coming!” he exclaimed.

Mrs Todgers almost screamed, for the little door of communication
between that room and the inner one being wide open, there was a full
disclosure of the sofa bedstead in all its monstrous impropriety. But
she had the presence of mind to close this portal in the twinkling of an
eye; and having done so, said, though not without confusion, ‘Oh yes, Mr
Pecksniff, you can come in, if you please.’

“It is not to be supposed, Louisa,” he said (Mrs Chick had nailed her
colours to the mast, and repeated “I know it isn’t,” but he took no
notice of it), “but that there are many persons who, supposing that I
recognised any claim at all in such a case, have a claim upon me
superior to Miss Tox’s. But I do not. I recognise no such thing. Paul
and myself will be able, when the time comes, to hold our own—the
House, in other words, will be able to hold its own, and maintain its
own, and hand down its own of itself, and without any such common-place
aids. The kind of foreign help which people usually seek for their
children, I can afford to despise; being above it, I hope. So that
Paul’s infancy and childhood pass away well, and I see him becoming
qualified without waste of time for the career on which he is destined
to enter, I am satisfied. He will make what powerful friends he pleases
in after-life, when he is actively maintaining—and extending, if that
is possible—the dignity and credit of the Firm. Until then, I am enough
for him, perhaps, and all in all. I have no wish that people should
step in between us. I would much rather show my sense of the obliging
conduct of a deserving person like your friend. Therefore let it be so;
and your husband and myself will do well enough for the other sponsors,
I daresay.”

[Illustration: JENNIE WREN.
  "THE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN THAT COME TO ME."]

"I beg your pardon, Mr. Weller," said Mr. John Smauker, agonised at the
exceedingly ungenteel sound, "will you take my arm?"

He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly
observant of me, biting a long end of it. “I think,” he answered, still
with the end at his mouth and still observant of me, “that I _will_
drink (I thank you) afore I go.”

‘It was all Mrs. Bumble. She _would_ do it,’ urged Mr. Bumble; first
looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.

‘He’s quite a animal, sir,’ John whispered in his ear with dignity.
‘You’ll excuse him, I’m sure. If he has any soul at all, sir, it must be
such a very small one, that it don’t signify what he does or doesn’t in
that way. Good night, sir!’

Lord love your honour! Weather! Such weather as
        would set all hands to the pumps aboard one of
        your fresh-water cockboats, and set the purser
        to his wits' ends to stow away, for the use of
        the ship's company, the casks and casks full of
        blue water as would come powering in over the
        gunnel! The dirtiest night, your honour, as
        ever you see 'atween Spithead at gun-fire and
        the Bay of Biscay! The wind sou'-west, and your
        house dead in the wind's eye; the breakers
        running up high upon the rocky beads, the
        light'us no more looking through the fog than
        Davy Jones's sarser eye through the blue sky of
        heaven in a calm, or the blue toplights of your
        honour's lady cast down in a modest overhauling
        of her catheads: avast! (_whistling_) my dear
        eyes; here am I a-goin' head on to the breakers
        (_bowing_).

‘He understands us, I see,’ said Arabella.

"Well, you look rosy enough my young friend," said Mr. Pickwick.

‘A gentleman taken ill upon the road, has been so very bad upstairs,
sir,’ said the tearful hostess.

"Should I?" said Steerforth. "Well, I think I should. I must see what
can be done. It would be worth a journey--not to mention the pleasure of
a journey with you, Daisy,--to see that sort of people together, and to
make one of 'em."

“No other question,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “If I hoped we could recall
him to a sense of his position—”

‘How long?’

‘You don’t say so?’ cried Tom, who was really concerned by this
insinuation.

"Two," interrupted Sam, "Mulberry agin all natur, for tears and
willainy!"

"And pray how ds the book-making, as the master calls it, get on,
Nugent?" inquired the captain: "have you made much progress?"

‘I am very happy and very thankful to know it,’ said the debtor, ‘though
I little thought once, that--’

Here Sam sat down with a pleasant smile, and his speech having been
vociferously applauded, the company broke up.

“Sure, little woman?”

Chapter 33

ASPECTS OF NATURE.

“Then you keep up as good a heart as you can, and you rely upon me
for standing by you, no less than by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.
Now, are you right there?”

When it became known to the Britons on the shore of the yellow Tiber
that their intelligent compatriot, Mr Sparkler, was made one of the
Lords of their Circumlocution Office, they took it as a piece of news
with which they had no nearer concern than with any other piece of
news--any other Accident or Offence--in the English papers. Some
laughed; some said, by way of complete excuse, that the post was
virtually a sinecure, and any fool who could spell his name was good
enough for it; some, and these the more solemn political oracles,
said that Decimus did wisely to strengthen himself, and that the sole
constitutional purpose of all places within the gift of Decimus, was,
that Decimus _should_ strengthen himself. A few bilious Britons there were
who would not subscribe to this article of faith; but their objection
was purely theoretical. In a practical point of view, they listlessly
abandoned the matter, as being the business of some other Britons
unknown, somewhere, or nowhere. In like manner, at home, great numbers
of Britons maintained, for as long as four-and-twenty consecutive hours,
that those invisible and anonymous Britons ‘ought to take it up;’ and
that if they quietly acquiesced in it, they deserved it. But of what
class the remiss Britons were composed, and where the unlucky creatures
hid themselves, and why they hid themselves, and how it constantly
happened that they neglected their interests, when so many other Britons
were quite at a loss to account for their not looking after those
interests, was not, either upon the shore of the yellow Tiber or the
shore of the black Thames, made apparent to men.

_Mrs C._
     Bolts and chains will bind him.

"The next verse is still more touching. Shall I repeat it?"

Clennam besought him not to delay a moment.

“Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
“Why don’t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don’t you go and fetch
things? I’ll let you know, if you don’t bring smelling-salts, cold
water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”

‘I suppose you’re Christopher, sir,’ said the servant-girl.

“Respecting that second-hand wiolinceller, governor—could you
recommend me such a thing?”

"Umtraction!" cries Jemmy.

"Why, it was the _reins_ that guided them," said the serjeant, laughing.

“Miss Dombey, I beg your pardon,” says Mr Toots, in a sad fluster, “but
if you would allow me to—to—”

I am coming to Paris for a week, with my friend Collins--son of the
English painter who painted our green lanes and our cottage children so
beautifully. Do not tell this to Le Vieux. Unless I have the ill fortune
to stumble against him in the street I shall not make my arrival known
to him.

‘How can I be otherwise than proud of it at any time! Pray give it to
me. Pray trust me.’

‘Ah, do,’ said Lowten, ‘nobody has heard it but me, and I have nearly
forgotten it.’

Guilty. The accused pleads guilty, but throws himself upon the mercy of
the court. He humbly represents that his usual hour for getting up, in
the course of his travels, was three o'clock in the morning, and his
usual hour for going to bed, nine or ten the next night. That the places
in which he chiefly deviated from these rules of hardship, were Rome and
Venice; and that at those cities of fame he shut himself up in solitude,
and wrote Christmas papers for the incomparable publication known as
"Household Words." That his correspondence at all times, arising out of
the business of the said "Household Words" alone, was very heavy. That
his offence, though undoubtedly committed, was unavoidable, and that a
nominal punishment will meet the justice of the case.

Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman
limped away with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return
with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women,
who shook and tottered as they walked.

When I walked about, exalted with my secret, and full of my own
interest, and felt the dignity of loving Dora, and of being beloved, so
much, that if I had walked the air, I could not have been more above the
people not so situated, who were creeping on the earth!

‘I am not afraid OF YOU,’ interposed Miss Potterson, ‘if you mean that.’

LETTERS OF CHARLES DICKENS.

We must confess that we looked forward with no slight impatience to
the announcement of supper; for if you wish to see a tame lion under
particularly favourable circumstances, feeding-time is the period of all
others to pitch upon. We were therefore very much delighted to observe
a sensation among the guests, which we well knew how to interpret,
and immediately afterwards to behold the lion escorting the lady of
the house down stairs. We offered our arm to an elderly female of our
acquaintance, who--dear old soul!--is the very best person that ever
lived, to lead down to any meal; for, be the room ever so small or the
party ever so large, she is sure, by some intuitive perception of the
eligible, to push and pull herself and conductor close to the best
dishes on the table;--we say we offered our arm to this elderly female,
and, descending the stairs shortly after the lion, were fortunate enough
to obtain a seat nearly opposite him.

I must have been married, if I may trust to my imperfect memory for
dates, about a year or so, when one evening, as I was returning from a
solitary walk, thinking of the book I was then writing--for my success
had steadily increased with my steady application, and I was engaged at
that time upon my first work of fiction--I came past Mrs. Steerforth’s
house. I had often passed it before, during my residence in that
neighbourhood, though never when I could choose another road. Howbeit,
it did sometimes happen that it was not easy to find another, without
making a long circuit; and so I had passed that way, upon the whole,
pretty often.

‘Now, just a leetle drop,’ said Mrs. Mann persuasively.

“Engaged!” cried Mr. Turveydrop, reclining on the sofa and shutting
out the sight with his hand. “An arrow launched at my brain by my own
child!”

‘Mrs. Pell was a tall figure,’ said Pell, ‘a splendid woman, with a
noble shape, and a nose, gentlemen, formed to command and be majestic.
She was very much attached to me--very much--highly connected, too. Her
mother’s brother, gentlemen, failed for eight hundred pounds, as a law
stationer.’

"But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating
ingenuity of D----; upon the fact that the document must always have
been _at hand_, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the
decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden
within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search, the more
satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister
had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not
attempting to conceal it.

“Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?”
said the officer; “he’s in the gig minding the prad. Have you got a
coach’us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes?”

‘That’s all, sir.’

“The prisoner’s.”

‘Why not do?’ retorted Peg. ‘Why don’t you wear your every-day clothes,
like a man--eh?’

“A gentleman?  Nonsense!”

"Not exactly," said Sam. "There's no daughters at my place, else o'
course I should ha' made up to vun on 'em. As it is, I don't think I
can do anything under a female markis. I might take up vith a young
'ooman o' large property, as hadn't a title, if she made wery fierce
love to me. Not else."

Lord Edward remained for two or three hours, until the alarm had
subsided, and the soldiers had left the street.

‘What would you have here?’ said a gaunt man, opening it.

"Naughty boy, naughty boy,
      Such words as these I never knew:
    Cupid, oh! you're alter'd so,
      No wonder I say
          "WHO ARE YOU?"

‘I do not, indeed,’ replied Nicholas.

Tired though I was, the night appeared about a week long.  In cases of
nightmare, I thought of Angela, and felt more depressed than ever by the
reflection that I was on the shortest road to Gretna Green.  What had _I_
to do with Gretna Green?  I was not going _that_ way to the Devil, but by
the American route, I remarked in my bitterness.

“George will look us up,” says Mr. Bagnet. “At half after four. To
the moment. How many years, old girl. Has George looked us up. This
afternoon?”

“I don’t quite know what to think, my dear, but I should say it was
likely at present that he will give a long trip to another country.”

In response to a demand for a popular-priced edition of this series of
books--the most famous set ever written by Horatio Alger, Jr.--this
edition has been prepared.

I was not considered as being formally received into the school,
however, until J. Steerforth arrived. Before this boy, who was reputed
to be a great scholar, and was very good-looking, and at least
half-a-dozen years older than I, I was carried as before a judge. He
inquired, under a shed in the playground, into the particulars of my
punishment, and was pleased to express his opinion that it was a "jolly
shame;" for which I became bound to him ever afterwards.

‘Will you step in, ma’am?’ Down got Mrs. Tuggs. The family were
delighted. Splendid view of the sea from the front windows—charming! A
short pause. Back came Mrs. Tuggs again.—One parlour and a mattress.

I found your letter here on my arrival yesterday. I had hoped that the
wall would have been almost finished by this time, and the additions to
the house almost finished too--but patience, patience!

‘Ay?’ cried Mrs Lammle. ‘Am I already corroborated, Bella?’

‘Very well,’ replied the old gentleman. ‘Sleepy as ever.’

‘Certainly,’ whispered Tottle, whose courage was vanishing fast.

"Not quite so, Captain Jorgan; but I failed in the broking business.  I
was partners with my brother, sir.  There was a sale of old office
furniture at Dringworth Brothers' when the house was moved from America
Square, and me and my brother made what we call in the trade a Deal
there, sir.  And I'll make bold to say, sir, that the only thing I ever
had from my brother, or from any relation,--for my relations have mostly
taken property from me instead of giving me any,--was an old desk we
bought at that same sale, with a crack in it.  My brother wouldn't have
given me even that, when we broke partnership, if it had been worth
anything."

He still held me in the same protecting manner and with the same
bright goodness in his face.

It wanted nine days to the end of the month, and end of the year.  The
Post-office packet for the United States was to depart from Liverpool,
weather permitting, on the first of the ensuing month, and I had the
intervening time on my hands.  I had taken this into consideration, and
had resolved to make a visit to a certain spot (which I need not name) on
the farther borders of Yorkshire.  It was endeared to me by my having
first seen Angela at a farmhouse in that place, and my melancholy was
gratified by the idea of taking a wintry leave of it before my
expatriation.  I ought to explain, that, to avoid being sought out before
my resolution should have been rendered irrevocable by being carried into
full effect, I had written to Angela overnight, in my usual manner,
lamenting that urgent business, of which she should know all particulars
by-and-by--took me unexpectedly away from her for a week or ten days.

“Here he is!” bawled Giles, calling, in a great state of excitement,
up the staircase; “here’s one of the thieves, ma’am! Here’s a thief,
miss—wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.”

"In words. No. Never."

Mrs Blimber was impressing on Mrs Toots the necessity of caution, when
Mr Feeder, B.A., offered her his arm, and led her down to the carriages
that were waiting to go to church. Doctor Blimber escorted Mrs Toots.
Mr Toots escorted the fair bride, around whose lambent spectacles two
gauzy little bridesmaids fluttered like moths. Mr Feeder’s brother, Mr
Alfred Feeder, M.A., had already gone on, in advance, to assume his
official functions.

Hugh fell back a pace or two and surveyed him with a look of mingled
terror, indignation, and surprise. Regarding himself in the glass with
the same complacency as before, and speaking as smoothly as if he were
discussing some pleasant chit-chat of the town, his patron went on:

‘It is strange,’ she said, frowning, ‘that you should still press an
undesired interest in me and my acquaintances, in me and my affairs, Mr
Clennam. I don’t know what you mean.’

Even as she spoke, the box appeared to be in progress of conveyance from
the house, but after a brief murmuring of question and answer, it was
put down again, and somebody knocked at the parlour door.

Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame
Defarge was drawing very near indeed.

“Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,” says Watt, “and I humbly ask
his pardon. I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family and
their guests down here, there is no objection to my prolonging my
stay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller
might?”

When little Oliver was taken before “the gentlemen” that evening; and
informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a
coffin-maker’s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever
came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be
drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so
little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened
young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.

_Manager._--Well! my theatre is built at last, and I have now only to
think about opening it. My walls are so dry that they cannot throw a
damp upon my prospects. My stage is all ready for starting; and every
one, I am happy to say, seems inclined to take the box-seat. Everything
now must go as smooth as a railroad. I have always heard that a manager
must lead a devil of a life; but I am in hopes I shall be an exception
to the rule, and that management to me will be a delightful pastime.

“Just so. Perfectly. As you say, Mr. Crisparkle,” interposed the Dean,
nodding his head smoothly, “there is nothing else to be done. No doubt,
no doubt. There is no alternative, as your good sense has discovered.”

"I don't!" she said. "Oh, dear me, don't suppose that I think anything!
I am not suspicious. I only ask a question. I don't state any opinion. I
want to found an opinion on what you tell me. Then, it's not so? Well! I
am very glad to know it."

"The attorneys for the plaintiff," said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz. "Well!
They spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of Messrs, Dodson
and Fogg, the attorneys for the plaintiff, did they?"

“What then!” replied Sikes with a tremendous oath. “If he was left
alive till I came, I’d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot
into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.”

Hearing this, and learning that Mr. Peggotty was there, I determined to
go to the house at once. I bade good night to Mr. Omer, and to Mr. and
Mrs. Joram; and directed my steps thither, with a solemn feeling, which
made Mr. Barkis quite a new and different creature.

"You are a couple of mean----"

As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an
ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey
a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman
thought it advisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being
uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme.

“Or,” said Estella,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her,
from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,
that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her
enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had
blighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,
for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she
could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”

‘The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind,
Mr. Winkle, which I fear would be of little service to honest,
straightforward men,’ interposed Mr. Skimpin. ‘You were on the
staircase, and didn’t distinctly hear; but you will not swear that
Pickwick did not make use of the expressions I have quoted? Do I
understand that?’

He said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of
my manner.  Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by
my bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how
much I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had
gained, gaining hard caution.  This state of mind being habitual to me, I
troubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled
myself about a greater matter.  I listened to his talk at dinner, and
observed how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful
instinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he
talked with.  As, in talking with me, he had easily started the subject I
might be supposed to understand best, and to be the most interested in,
so, in talking with others, he guided himself by the same rule.  The
company was of a varied character; but he was not at fault, that I could
discover, with any member of it.  He knew just as much of each man’s
pursuit as made him agreeable to that man in reference to it, and just as
little as made it natural in him to seek modestly for information when
the theme was broached.

I do not trouble your mother by writing to her separately. It is a sad,
sad task to write at all. God help us!

The boy soon returned at the head of a long row of others, great and
small, who stood shyly before the little group of which the Bachelor was
the centre.

"Well, sir, I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the
garden behind, alone----"

At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned
the corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and,
closing the door, went back to her own room.

Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
answered:

Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,
as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent
down and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he said, “Pip, old chap,
you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my hand
and said no more.

“Why didn’t you, blunder-head?” said Kags.

He paused to take from his pocket the letter he had written overnight,
and then resumed:

‘Why, really there ain’t much time to lose,’ replied Jackson; ‘and I’ve
got a friend here,’ he continued, looking towards the man with the ash
stick.

‘I dispense with style!’ said Mr Blandois, waving his hand. ‘Do me the
honour to show me the house, and introduce me there (if I am not too
troublesome), and I shall be infinitely obliged.’

"There is some one lying below," said Marguerite.

"I might come here sometimes perhaps, to see you," said Mary, plaiting
the table-cloth in assumed coyness, "if you would do me a favour."

‘Also very young, eh?’

“Not exactly, Sir: no; on reflection I don’t know that I can,” answered
Mr. Blenkinsop. He had now, it was such a civil, well-spoken
statue--lost all sense of the preternatural horror of his situation, and
scratched his head just as if he had been posed in argument by an
ordinary mortal.

But the air of smartness, the cock of the hat to which John Willet had
objected, and the spring nosegay, all betokened some little errand
of his own, having a more interesting object than a vintner or even a
locksmith. So, indeed, it turned out; for when he had settled with the
vintner--whose place of business was down in some deep cellars hard by
Thames Street, and who was as purple-faced an old gentleman as if he
had all his life supported their arched roof on his head--when he had
settled the account, and taken the receipt, and declined tasting more
than three glasses of old sherry, to the unbounded astonishment of the
purple-faced vintner, who, gimlet in hand, had projected an attack upon
at least a score of dusty casks, and who stood transfixed, or morally
gimleted as it were, to his own wall--when he had done all this, and
disposed besides of a frugal dinner at the Black Lion in Whitechapel;
spurning the Monument and John’s advice, he turned his steps towards the
locksmith’s house, attracted by the eyes of blooming Dolly Varden.

To the ineffable surprise of the king, the bishop was so injudicious as
to ask his host, in the most direct and pointed manner, who he was, and
whence he came there.

"Straight and swift I ran, and no one dared to stop me. I heard the
noise of feet behind, and redoubled my speed. It grew fainter and
fainter in the distance, and at length died away altogether: but on I
bounded, through marsh and rivulet, over fence and wall, with a wild
shout which was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me
on every side, and swelled the sound, till it pierced the air. I was
borne upon the arms of demons, who swept along upon the wind, and bore
down bank and hedge before them, and spun me round and round with a
rustle and speed that made my head swim, until at last they threw me
from them with a violent shock, and I fell heavily upon the earth. When
I woke I found myself here--here in this gay cell where the sunlight
seldom comes, and the moon steals in, in rays which only serve to show
the dark shadows about me, and that silent figure in its old corner.
When I lie awake, I can sometimes hear strange shrieks and cries from
distant parts of this large place. What they are, I know not; but they
neither come from that pale form, nor does it regard them. For from
the first shades of dusk till the earliest light of morning, it still
stands motionless in the same place, listening to the music of my iron
chain, and watching my gambols on my straw bed."

“Hush!” cried the man; “it won’t answer here. Say another word, and
I’ll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no
noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench
the shutter open. He’s game enough now, I’ll engage. I’ve seen older
hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold
night.”

“Gone out to dinner,” said Mrs Pipchin.

“It’s a good deal out of repair, ma’am, but it’s not in ruins.”

I sit in the Châlet,[26] like Mariana in the Moated Grange, and to as
much purpose.

‘Ten shillings too much,’ said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.

His hopefulness had long been more painful to me than his
despondency; it was so unlike hopefulness, had something so fierce in
its determination to be it, was so hungry and eager, and yet so
conscious of being forced and unsustainable that it had long touched
me to the heart. But the commentary upon it now indelibly written in
his handsome face made it far more distressing than it used to be. I
say indelibly, for I felt persuaded that if the fatal cause could
have been for ever terminated, according to his brightest visions, in
that same hour, the traces of the premature anxiety, self-reproach,
and disappointment it had occasioned him would have remained upon his
features to the hour of his death.

“Begging your pardon, not even if I am to leave the situation, Sir,”
replied the steadfast Nipper, “in which I have been so many years and
seen so much—although I hope you’d never have the heart to send me from
Miss Floy for such a cause—will I go now till I have said the rest, I
may not be a Indian widow Sir and I am not and I would not so become
but if I once made up my mind to burn myself alive, I’d do it! And I’ve
made my mind up to go on.”

Although Mr Pancks’s hair was standing up like strong wire, he gave it
another double-handed impulse in the perpendicular direction, and smiled
at his proprietor in a most hideous manner.

Mr. Pickwick’s oration upon this occasion, together with the debate
thereon, is entered on the Transactions of the Club. Both bear a strong
affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies; and, as it is
always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of
great men, we transfer the entry to these pages.

"Suddenly an officer of the Walloon guards came into the room. 'M. de
Beaumarchais,' he said, 'you have not a moment to lose. Save yourself,
or to-morrow morning you will be arrested in your bed. The order is
given, and I am come to apprise you of it. Your adversary is a monster.
He has contrived to set almost everybody against you, and has led you
into snare after snare, till he has found means to make himself your
public accuser. Fly instantly, I beseech you. Once immured in a dungeon,
you will have neither protection nor defence.'

It is an appropriate instance of the universality of the newsman’s
calling that no toast we have drunk to-night—and no toast we shall drink
to-night—and no toast we might, could, should, or would drink to-night,
is separable for a moment from that great inclusion of all possible
subjects of human interest which he delivers at our doors every day.
Further, it may be worthy the consideration of everybody here who has
talked cheerfully to his or her neighbour since we have sat down at the
table, what in the name of Heaven should we have talked about, and how on
earth could we have possibly got on, if our newsman had only for one
single day forgotten us.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, as our newsman is
not by any means in the habit of forgetting us, let us try to form a
little habit of not forgetting our newsman.  Let us remember that his
work is very arduous; that it occupies him early and late; that the
profits he derives from us are at the best very small; that the services
he renders to us are very great; that if he be a master, his little
capital is exposed to all sorts of mischances, anxieties, and hazards;
and if he be a journeyman, he himself is exposed to all manner of
weathers, of tempers, and of difficult and unreasonable requirements.

“I should like to know how—how my mother and Miss Maylie are,” said the
young man; “and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you
take, and what you talk about, and whether she—they, I mean—seem happy
and quite well. You understand me?”

‘No--No,’ returned his lord. ‘No. Why should I? I suppose it would be
decidedly irreligious to doubt it--wouldn’t it, Gashford? Though there
certainly were,’ he added, without waiting for an answer, ‘some plaguy
ill-looking characters among them.’

He should fine Weller two pounds for the first assault, and three pounds
for the second. He should fine Winkle two pounds, and Snodgrass one
pound, besides requiring them to enter into their own recognisances to
keep the peace towards all his Majesty’s subjects, and especially
towards his liege servant, Daniel Grummer. Pickwick and Tupman he had
already held to bail.

‘True, too,’ he answered, pressing her hand, but still looking
anxiously about.  ‘What noise was that?’

"I never see sich a aggerawatin' boy as you are, Samivel," said Mr.
Weller, looking indignantly at his son; "never in all my born days."

As to the Commons, I had no great occasion to be particular about my
duties in that quarter. To say the truth, we were getting in no very
good odour among the tip-top proctors, and were rapidly sliding down to
but a doubtful position. The business had been indifferent under Mr.
Jorkins, before Mr. Spenlow's time; and although it had been quickened
by the infusion of new blood, and by the display which Mr. Spenlow made,
still it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to bear,
without being shaken, such a blow as the sudden loss of its active
manager. It fell off very much. Mr. Jorkins, notwithstanding his
reputation in the firm, was an easy-going, incapable, sort of man, whose
reputation out of doors was not calculated to back it up. I was turned
over to him now, and when I saw him take his snuff and let the business
go, I regretted my aunt's thousand pounds more than ever.

“That has a bad look,” said Darnay--

The landlady of the Hôtel de l’Ecu d’Or is here; and the landlord of the
Hôtel de l’Ecu d’Or is here; and the femme de chambre of the Hôtel de
l’Ecu d’Or is here; and a gentleman in a glazed cap, with a red beard
like a bosom friend, who is staying at the Hôtel de l’Ecu d’Or, is here;
and Monsieur le Curé is walking up and down in a corner of the yard by
himself, with a shovel hat upon his head, and a black gown on his back,
and a book in one hand, and an umbrella in the other; and everybody,
except Monsieur le Curé, is open-mouthed and open-eyed, for the opening
of the carriage-door.  The landlord of the Hôtel de l’Ecu d’Or, dotes to
that extent upon the Courier, that he can hardly wait for his coming down
from the box, but embraces his very legs and boot-heels as he descends.
‘My Courier!  My brave Courier!  My friend!  My brother!’  The landlady
loves him, the femme de chambre blesses him, the garçon worships him.
The Courier asks if his letter has been received?  It has, it has.  Are
the rooms prepared?  They are, they are.  The best rooms for my noble
Courier.  The rooms of state for my gallant Courier; the whole house is
at the service of my best of friends!  He keeps his hand upon the
carriage-door, and asks some other question to enhance the expectation.
He carries a green leathern purse outside his coat, suspended by a belt.
The idlers look at it; one touches it.  It is full of five-franc pieces.
Murmurs of admiration are heard among the boys.  The landlord falls upon
the Courier’s neck, and folds him to his breast.  He is so much fatter
than he was, he says!  He looks so rosy and so well!

“No.”

‘I cannot doubt, Mr Headstone, that your visit is well meant. You have
been so good a friend to Charley that I have no right to doubt it. I
have nothing to tell Charley, but that I accepted the help to which he
so much objects before he made any plans for me; or certainly before I
knew of any. It was considerately and delicately offered, and there were
reasons that had weight with me which should be as dear to Charley as to
me. I have no more to say to Charley on this subject.’

"On the contrary, my dear," replied the old bachelor, "we had formed
quite an erroneous opinion of M. d'Apremont. I found him so agreeable
and so well-bred, that I have asked him to come very often to play
with me,--I mean, to pay his court to you. He is a very clever,
gentlemanlike young man."

‘Very bad,’ said the landlord. As of course, being a landlord, he would
say.

Seeing that he was confused and agitated, and uncertain what to do, Mr.
Pickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided stroller’s arm
through his, and leading him away, without saying another word about it.

*       *       *       *       *

‘Quite well, I thank you,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, with all his usual
affability. ‘Have you been long in England?’

Kate was too sick at heart, after the rough jostling she had already had
with the world, and really cared too little at the moment what fate was
reserved for her, to make any objection. Mr. Ralph Nickleby offered none,
but, on the contrary, highly approved of the suggestion; neither did he
express any great surprise at Madame Mantalini’s sudden failure, indeed
it would have been strange if he had, inasmuch as it had been procured
and brought about chiefly by himself. So, the name and address were
obtained without loss of time, and Miss Nickleby and her mama went off
in quest of Mrs. Wititterly, of Cadogan Place, Sloane Street, that same
forenoon.

‘A what?’ asked Hardy, rather taken aback.

“I must thank you, Jasper, for the pleasure with which I have heard you
to-day. Beautiful! Delightful! You could not have so outdone yourself,
I hope, without being wonderfully well.”

‘What a beautiful prospect, Mr. Tuggs!’

‘Pale!’ echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to
look steadily at him.

MEMOIRS

Indeed, the bearing of this impressive woman, throughout the day, was a
pattern to all impressive women under similar circumstances. She renewed
the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin, as if Mr and Mrs Boffin had said
of her what she had said of them, and as if Time alone could quite wear
her injury out. She regarded every servant who approached her, as her
sworn enemy, expressly intending to offer her affronts with the dishes,
and to pour forth outrages on her moral feelings from the decanters.
She sat erect at table, on the right hand of her son-in-law, as half
suspecting poison in the viands, and as bearing up with native force of
character against other deadly ambushes. Her carriage towards Bella was
as a carriage towards a young lady of good position, whom she had met in
society a few years ago. Even when, slightly thawing under the influence
of sparkling champagne, she related to her son-in-law some passages of
domestic interest concerning her papa, she infused into the narrative
such Arctic suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to
mankind, since her papa’s days, and also of that gentleman’s having
been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race, as struck cold to the
very soles of the feet of the hearers. The Inexhaustible being produced,
staring, and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly, no
sooner beheld her, than it was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable. When
she took her leave at last, it would have been hard to say whether it
was with the air of going to the scaffold herself, or of leaving the
inmates of the house for immediate execution. Yet, John Harmon enjoyed
it all merrily, and told his wife, when he and she were alone, that her
natural ways had never seemed so dearly natural as beside this foil,
and that although he did not dispute her being her father’s daughter,
he should ever remain stedfast in the faith that she could not be her
mother’s.

‘You should recollect, my dear,’ resumed Mrs. Malderton, ‘that Teresa
is now eight-and-twenty; and that it really is very important that
something should be done.’

_Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine_, 31, 131.

“I would rather you told, Joe.”

"Never fear," said Mr. Winkle. "Are they pointing?"

‘Yes, I should rather have inferred, my dear sir,’ returned the cherub
feebly, ‘that Bella took you, from what I have within these few minutes
remarked.’

"Our tokens of love are for the most part barbarous.  Cold and lifeless,
because they do not represent our life.  The only gift is a portion of
thyself.  Therefore let the farmer give his corn; the miner, a gem; the
sailor, coral and shells; the painter, his picture; and the poet, his
poem."--Emerson's Essays.

“Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly, with
his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
his back.

‘Wy don’t you?’ said Sam, urging his question strenuously.

Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.

‘It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,’ said
Mr. Sikes. ‘Give him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make
haste! It’s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase
shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.’

She softly played on, looking at me still.

The newsvendors and newsmen are a very subordinate part of that wonderful
engine—the newspaper press.  Still I think we all know very well that
they are to the fountain-head what a good service of water pipes is to a
good water supply.  Just as a goodly store of water at Watford would be a
tantalization to thirsty London if it were not brought into town for its
use, so any amount of news accumulated at Printing-house Square, or Fleet
Street, or the Strand, would be if there were no skill and enterprise
engaged in its dissemination.

MY DEAR COLLINS,

The dwarf’s lodging on Tower hill comprised, besides the needful
accommodation for himself and Mrs Quilp, a small sleeping-closet for
that lady’s mother, who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war
with Daniel; of whom, notwithstanding, she stood in no slight dread.
Indeed, the ugly creature contrived by some means or other--whether by
his ugliness or his ferocity or his natural cunning is no great
matter--to impress with a wholesome fear of his anger, most of those
with whom he was brought into daily contact and communication. Over
nobody had he such complete ascendance as Mrs Quilp herself--a pretty
little, mild-spoken, blue-eyed woman, who having allied herself in
wedlock to the dwarf in one of those strange infatuations of which
examples are by no means scarce, performed a sound practical penance
for her folly, every day of her life.

“My uncle,” I muttered. “Yes.”

"Yes, she is tired, Cobbs; but she is not used to be away from home, and
she has been in low spirits again.  Cobbs, do you think you could bring a
biffin, please?"

The dogs suddenly came to a dead stop, and the party advancing
stealthily a single pace, stopped too.

Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,
and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and
heavy roll of some dark stuff.

‘It’s all ready,’ said he, offering the pistol. ‘Give me your cloak.’

“Bill, my boy!” said this figure, turning his head towards the door,
“I’m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you’d given it up: in which
case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!”

_Manager._--Show them in. (_Exit Servant._) Some new candidates, I
suppose: here they come. Ladies! they are the first that have done me
the honour to apply to me.

“And not only here, but you will go to Mr. Snagsby’s too, perhaps?
That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?”

Presently I chanced to see a pasteboard sign lying upon a desk and
bearing these words:

To tell how Kit then hustled into the box all sorts of things which
could, by no remote contingency, be wanted, and how he left out
everything likely to be of the smallest use; how a neighbour was
persuaded to come and stop with the children, and how the children at
first cried dismally, and then laughed heartily on being promised all
kinds of impossible and unheard-of toys; how Kit’s mother wouldn’t
leave off kissing them, and how Kit couldn’t make up his mind to be
vexed with her for doing it; would take more time and room than you and
I can spare.  So, passing over all such matters, it is sufficient to
say that within a few minutes after the two hours had expired, Kit and
his mother arrived at the Notary’s door, where a post-chaise was
already waiting.

‘You think so now, Harry,’ replied his mother.

That candles were a necessity of life he was well convinced, and by
faith he dimly accepted the fact that one day in the year the whole
house was to be devoted and given up to this manufacture; and his part
of the business, as he understood it, was, clearly, to keep himself out
of the way till it was over.

“In consequence of which,” said Mr. Bucket, dismissing his agreeable
manner all at once and becoming strictly business-like, “you’ve got
that will upon your person at the present time, and the only thing
that remains for you to do is just to out with it!”

[Illustration: AFTER HOLDING HER TO HIS BREAST WITH A PASSIONATE CRY, HE

EYES--Book 1, chap. vi.]

Her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me, but it
was necessary to be explicit, and I solemnly repeated:

‘Educate the grown-up people,’ replied Alice.  ‘We part to-night.  Yes,
Redforth,’—for the colonel tucked up his cuffs,—‘part to-night!  Let us
in these next holidays, now going to begin, throw our thoughts into
something educational for the grown-up people, hinting to them how things
ought to be.  Let us veil our meaning under a mask of romance; you, I,
and Nettie.  William Tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer,
shall copy out.  Is it agreed?’

‘I will sooner lay down my life than comply,’ cried Randulph resolutely.

He ceased to speak, and his hand upon the table rested there in perfect
repose, with a resolution in it that might have conquered lions.

She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,
“She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips and
eyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of
his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such
occasions, and looked at her.

Profiting by these and other lessons, which were the result of the
personal experience of the two actors, Nicholas willingly gave them the
best breakfast he could, and, when he at length got rid of them, applied
himself to his task: by no means displeased to find that it was so much
easier than he had at first supposed. He worked very hard all day,
and did not leave his room until the evening, when he went down to the
theatre, whither Smike had repaired before him to go on with another
gentleman as a general rebellion.

GEORGE ALFRED WILLIAMS

Or how there was detention at Marseilles from stress of weather; and
steamers were advertised to go, which did not go; or how the good
Steam-packet Charlemagne at length put out, and met such weather that now
she threatened to run into Toulon, and now into Nice, but, the wind
moderating, did neither, but ran on into Genoa harbour instead, where the
familiar Bells rang sweetly in my ear.  Or how there was a travelling
party on board, of whom one member was very ill in the cabin next to
mine, and being ill was cross, and therefore declined to give up the
Dictionary, which he kept under his pillow; thereby obliging his
companions to come down to him, constantly, to ask what was the Italian
for a lump of sugar—a glass of brandy and water—what’s o’clock? and so
forth: which he always insisted on looking out, with his own sea-sick
eyes, declining to entrust the book to any man alive.

“Ah! wicked guesser!” replied Cleopatra, shaking her head. “Ah!
cunning, cunning man! One shouldn’t tell these things; your sex, my
dear Dombey, are so vain, and so apt to abuse our weakness; but you
know my open soul—very well; immediately.”

‘You say well,’ returned Nicholas at length, ‘and comfort me very much,
dear fellow. Let me hear you say you are happy, if you can.’

All these arrangements had been made some months, and it was a dark,
wintry, December night, when the conspirators, who had been in the
meantime dispersed to avoid observation, met in the house at
Westminster, and began to dig. They had laid in a good stock of
eatables, to avoid going in and out, and they dug and dug with great
ardour. But, the wall being tremendously thick, and the work very
severe, they took into their plot Christopher Wright, a younger brother
of John Wright, that they might have a new pair of hands to help. And
Christopher Wright fell to like a fresh man, and they dug and dug by
night and by day, and Fawkes stood sentinel all the time. And if any
man’s heart seemed to fail him at all, Fawkes said, ‘Gentlemen, we have
abundance of powder and shot here, and there is no fear of our being
taken alive, even if discovered.’ The same Fawkes, who, in the capacity
of sentinel, was always prowling about, soon picked up the intelligence
that the King had prorogued the Parliament again, from the seventh of
February, the day first fixed upon, until the third of October. When
the conspirators knew this, they agreed to separate until after the
Christmas holidays, and to take no notice of each other in the
meanwhile, and never to write letters to one another on any account.
So, the house in Westminster was shut up again, and I suppose the
neighbours thought that those strange-looking men who lived there so
gloomily, and went out so seldom, were gone away to have a merry
Christmas somewhere.

I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed
to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going
unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind
which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of
Peggotty's fore-finger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its
being roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.

‘And you are bound for all our sakes to take particular care of your
digestion, Mr Chuzzlewit, my dear sir,’ said the doctor smacking his
lips after a glass of wine; ‘for depend upon it, it is worth preserving.
It must be in admirable condition, sir; perfect chronometer-work.
Otherwise your spirits could not be so remarkable. Your bosom’s lord
sits lightly on its throne, Mr Chuzzlewit, as what’s-his-name says in
the play. I wish he said it in a play which did anything like common
justice to our profession, by the bye. There is an apothecary in
that drama, sir, which is a low thing; vulgar, sir; out of nature
altogether.’

“I am very glad to see you have so much feeling, Richards,” said Miss
Tox.

CHAPTER XVII -- OLIVER’S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A
GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION

"I tell you again, he is not at home."

Attracted by a louder sputtering than usual, as the rain came hissing
down the chimney in a little stream, the old woman raised her head,
impatiently, to listen afresh. And this time she did not drop it again;
for there was a hand upon the door, and a footstep in the room.

“My readers have opportunities of judging for themselves whether the
    influences and tendencies which I distrusted in America, have any
    existence but in my imagination.  They can examine for themselves
    whether there has been anything in the public career of that country
    during these past eight years, or whether there is anything in its
    present position, at home or abroad, which suggests that those
    influences and tendencies really do exist.  As they find the fact,
    they will judge me.  If they discern any evidences of wrong-going, in
    any direction that I have indicated, they will acknowledge that I had
    reason in what I wrote.  If they discern no such thing, they will
    consider me altogether mistaken.  I have nothing to defend, or to
    explain away.  The truth is the truth; and neither childish
    absurdities, nor unscrupulous contradictions, can make it otherwise.
    The earth would still move round the sun, though the whole Catholic
    Church said No.”

As before, all went well till the grave-diggers' scene commenced;
when Kemble, while waiting for his "cue" to go on, listened bodingly
to the roars of laughter which greeted the colloquy of Davis and
his companion. At length he entered, and at the same moment, Davis
having manufactured a grotesque visage, was received with a shout of
laughter, which greatly tended to excite the anger of "King John." His
first words were spoken, but failed to make any impression: and upon
turning towards Davis, he discovered that worthy standing in the grave,
displaying a series of highly unsuitable although richly comic grimaces.

“It’s a long time,” said Mr. Bumble. “Very good. I’ve done it.”

"Whatever you heard of his marrying was all nonsense, I can assure you.
I knew him well, and he had no thoughts of the kind about him. Some of
the boys used to tease him about it, but he soon made them stop."

"The Tuileries was soon afterwards invaded by the mob, and Louis's
head assumed the symbol of revolution; the crown was already crushed,
the red cap had taken its position even upon the monarch's brow;
royalty was no more, and my heart exulted in its annihilation. Still I
pitied the fate of the Bourbons. The people feared them; there seemed
something in the very name of king which stirred up feelings no earthly
power could subdue. The secrecy I had observed with Madame T----
relative to the flight of the royal family had exposed me to suspicion,
and my condemnation would have been sealed but for the timely rescue
of my aged relative, who saved me from assassination; but I no longer
held influence with either party. I exhorted the countess to fly with
me; but the noble and heroic woman remained firm to her duty, and I
determined rather to perish with her than leave her to the remorseless
cruelty of the rabble.

‘Bother that!’ returned Fledgeby. ‘You know what I mean. You’d persuade
me if you could, that you are a poor Jew. I wish you’d confess how much
you really did make out of my late governor. I should have a better
opinion of you.’

"I haven't created any wery surprisin' sensation here, as yet,"
rejoined Sam, "for me and the other fashionables only come last night."

"Why, bless my life and soul!" said Mr. Omer, "how do you find yourself?
Take a seat.--Smoke not disagreeable, I hope?"

Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd.  A score of
dirty hands were raised directly to knock for him, and seldom has a
knocker of equal powers been made to produce more deafening sounds than
this particular engine on the occasion in question.  Having rendered
these voluntary services, the throng modestly retired a little,
preferring that the single gentleman should bear their consequences
alone.

CHAPTER XI—MAKING A NIGHT OF IT

The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick's coat as was yet visible, bore
testimony to the accuracy of this statement; and as the fears of the
spectators were still further relieved by the fat boy's suddenly
recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep,
prodigies of valour were performed to get him out. After a vast
quantity of splashing, and cracking, and struggling, Mr. Pickwick was
at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position, and once more
stood on dry land.

‘Martha, my dear,’ said the locksmith, when they reached the parlour,
‘if you’ll look to Dolly yourself or let somebody else do it, perhaps it
will be only kind and reasonable. She has been frightened, you know, and
is not at all well to-night.’

‘You have chosen for yourself, Tom, and will be relieved by our parting.
It is not an angry one. There is no anger on my side--’

I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of
ours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to
Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. _I_ was
not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.

All that you so earnestly say about the goodwill and devotion of all
engaged, I perceived and deeply felt last night. It moved me even more
than the demonstration itself, though I do suppose it was the most
brilliant ever seen. When I got up to speak, but for taking a desperate
hold of myself, I should have lost my sight and voice and sat down
again.

D'Apremont, who, before he had seen Nathalie, went very little into
society, particularly to balls, from henceforth never missed going
wherever he had a chance of meeting his fair widow. He had succeeded in
speaking to her, and had done his utmost to render himself agreeable.
His behaviour was entirely changed, and the world was not more slow
than usual in discovering the cause, or in commenting upon the marked
attention which he paid to Nathalie.

When the rioters first assembled before the building, the murderer
was roused from sleep--if such slumbers as his may have that blessed
name--by the roar of voices, and the struggling of a great crowd. He
started up as these sounds met his ear, and, sitting on his bedstead,
listened.

Mr. Simpkinson from Bath was a professed antiquary, and one of the first
water; he was master of Gwillim's Heraldry, and Milles's History of the
Crusades; knew every plate in the Monasticon, had written an essay on
the origin and dignity of the office of Overseer, and settled the date
of a Queen Anne's farthing. An influential member of the Antiquarian
Society, to whose "Beauties of Bagnigge Wells" he had been a liberal
subscriber, procured him a seat at the board of that learned body,
since which happy epoch Sylvanus Urban had not a more indefatigable
correspondent. His inaugural essay on the President's cocked hat was
considered a miracle of erudition; and his account of the earliest
application of gilding to gingerbread, a masterpiece of antiquarian
research. His eldest daughter was of a kindred spirit: if her father's
mantle had not fallen upon her, it was only because he had not thrown
it off himself; she had caught hold of its tail, however, while yet
upon his honoured shoulders. To souls so congenial what a sight was
the magnificent ruin of Bolsover! its broken arches, its mouldering
pinnacles, and the airy tracery of its half-demolished windows. The
party was in raptures; Mr. Simpkinson began to meditate an essay, and
his daughter an ode: even Seaforth, as he gazed on these lonely relics
of the olden time, was betrayed into a momentary forgetfulness of his
love and losses; the widow's eye-glass turned from her _cicisbeo_'s
whiskers to the mantling ivy; Mrs. Peters wiped her spectacles; and
"her P." pronounced the central tower to be "very like a mouldy Stilton
cheese,--only bigger." The squire was a philosopher, and had been there
often before; so he ordered out the cold tongue and chickens.

"No, no," said Mr. Winkle, colouring beneath Mr. Pickwick's gaze;
"there is really nothing. I assure you there is nothing, my dear sir.
It will be necessary for me to leave town, for a short time, on private
business, and I had hoped to have prevailed upon you to allow Sam to
accompany me."

"Bless my heart," said Mr. Pickwick, looking very blank; "what do they
do that for?"

‘And of a lawyer too?’ inquired Sam.

My spirits sank under these words, and I became very downcast and heavy
of heart. My aunt, without appearing to take much heed of me, put on a
coarse apron with a bib, which she took out of the press; washed up the
teacups with her own hands; and, when everything was washed and set in
the tray again, and the cloth folded and put on the top of the whole,
rang for Janet to remove it. She next swept up the crumbs with a little
broom (putting on a pair of gloves first), until there did not appear
to be one microscopic speck left on the carpet; next dusted and arranged
the room, which was dusted and arranged to a hair’s breadth already.
When all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction, she took off
the gloves and apron, folded them up, put them in the particular corner
of the press from which they had been taken, brought out her work-box
to her own table in the open window, and sat down, with the green fan
between her and the light, to work.

"This," said the matronly presence, ushering me into a low room on the
right, "is where the Travellers sit by the fire, and cook what bits of
suppers they buy with their fourpences."

“Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. “Now that
you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to
save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who
love her, bear to see her so?”

He left off scraping his chin, and sucked in his cheeks until they
seemed to meet inside; keeping his sidelong glance upon me all the
while.

She shook her head, turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine, kissed
me, broke into a merry laugh, and sprang away to put on Jip’s new
collar.

The night--I mean the real night: not going by Fairy clocks--was wearing
now; and, in this stage of the Carrier's thoughts, the moon burst out,
and shone brightly in the sky. Perhaps some calm and quiet light had
risen also in his mind; and he could think more soberly of what had
happened.

"You don't see how the master is winking at me," whispered Caleb in his
daughter's ear--"such a joke, pretending to scold, you know."

Nicholas bit his lip and shook his head in a threatening manner, but
appeared for the moment unable to articulate a syllable. Kate clung
closer to his arm, Smike retreated behind them, and John Browdie,
who had heard of Ralph, and appeared to have no great difficulty in
recognising him, stepped between the old man and his young friend, as
if with the intention of preventing either of them from advancing a step
further.

“But I am afraid I trouble you too much,” said Mr Dombey.

And if he did, what would it be to see a woman going by? There are
women enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks—too many; they are
at the bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of
that, they create business for lawyers. What would it be to see a
woman going by, even though she were going secretly? They are all
secret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.

"It's a very unfortunate thing," said the prim man. "Just as we were
getting so comfortable too!" The prim man was just beginning to have a
dawning recollection of the story he had forgotten.

Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy,
and offered to cut any gentleman in company for the first
picture-card, at a shilling a time. Nobody accepting the challenge, and
his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself
by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of
chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling meantime with
peculiar shrillness.

MY DEAR GEORGY,

(12) "Le Grand Laboureur."

I was stopped by my godmother’s rising, putting her hand to her head,
and crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,
“‘Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And
what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!’”

“A drain for the boy,” said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. “Down with
it, innocence.”

‘I know you do, but you overtask your strength. This wretched life, my
love, of daily labour and fatigue, is more than you can bear, I am sure
it is. Poor Madeline!’

“Your remarks,” returned Miss Twinkleton, from a remote moral eminence,
“are well meant, I have no doubt; but you will permit me to observe
that they develop a mistaken view of the subject, which can only be
imputed to your extreme want of accurate information.”

‘For me?’ cried Mr Pecksniff. ‘And an answer, eh?’

"Not here--not here," said the boy, looking around; "but I'm so glad
you've come back!"

GOOD AND BAD ANGELS.

"What did he mean by talking about favorites, then?" said Steerforth at
length.

‘Not who?’ the child inquired.

“About the mother of the boy you named,” replied the matron
interrupting him. “Yes.”

She watched him still attentively. But he watched her too; and he saw
that this indication of a knowledge on his part, of something that had
passed between herself and her husband, rankled and smarted in her
haughty breast, like a poisoned arrow.

‘The Boffins.’

Mark replied in the affirmative.

This Mr. Frank Cheeryble, although, to judge from what had recently taken
place, a hot-headed young man (which is not an absolute miracle and
phenomenon in nature), was a sprightly, good-humoured, pleasant fellow,
with much both in his countenance and disposition that reminded Nicholas
very strongly of the kind-hearted brothers. His manner was as unaffected
as theirs, and his demeanour full of that heartiness which, to most
people who have anything generous in their composition, is peculiarly
prepossessing. Add to this, that he was good-looking and intelligent,
had a plentiful share of vivacity, was extremely cheerful, and
accommodated himself in five minutes’ time to all John Browdie’s
oddities with as much ease as if he had known him from a boy; and it
will be a source of no great wonder that, when they parted for the
night, he had produced a most favourable impression, not only upon the
worthy Yorkshireman and his wife, but upon Nicholas also, who, revolving
all these things in his mind as he made the best of his way home,
arrived at the conclusion that he had laid the foundation of a most
agreeable and desirable acquaintance.

I informed her that he sent his compliments, and was getting on very
well indeed.

"I shall be sure to come," said Falcon; he took the note, and dismissed
the maid.

‘The artillery taken in this disgraceful defeat consisted of fourteen
pieces, of which four were curricle guns. The courageous behaviour of
the Fraser Fencibles has been mentioned with admiration as a conspicuous
example of gallantry against desperate odds.’

You know all the news, and you know I love you; so I no more know why I
write than I do why I "come round" after the play to shake hands with
you in your dressing-room. I say come, as if you were at this present
moment the lessee of Drury Lane, and had ---- with a long face on one
hand, ---- elaborately explaining that everything in creation is a
joint-stock company on the other, the inimitable B. by the fire, in
conversation with ----. Well-a-day! I see it all, and smell that
extraordinary compound of odd scents peculiar to a theatre, which bursts
upon me when I swing open the little door in the hall, accompanies me as
I meet perspiring supers in the narrow passage, goes with me up the two
steps, crosses the stage, winds round the third entrance P.S. as I wind,
and escorts me safely into your presence, where I find you unwinding
something slowly round and round your chest, which is so long that no
man can see the end of it.

Boots is clear that the principle is the same. So is Buffer. It is the
unfortunate destiny of Buffer to damage a cause by espousing it. The
rest of the company have meekly yielded to the proposition that the
principle is the same, until Buffer says it is; when instantly a general
murmur arises that the principle is not the same.

Mr. Phunky bowed to Mr. Pickwick with a reverence which a first
    client must ever awaken; and again inclined his head towards his
    leader.

Since then, what wandering thoughts I may have had of attempting the
life of an ancient ewe, of a superannuated hen, and such “small deer,”
are locked up in the secrets of my own breast; but for the higher
departments of the art, I confess myself to be utterly unfit. My
ambition does not rise so high. No, gentlemen, in the words of Horace,--

“Not a business-like acknowledgment,” returned Mr. Grewgious; “however,
let that pass. Now, in that document you have observed a few words of
kindly allusion to its being left to me to discharge a little trust,
confided to me in conversation, at such time as I in my discretion may
think best.”

If I go and look at your old house, as I shall if I go to Florence, I
shall bring you back another leaf from the same tree as I plucked the
last from.

"Give it to me, I tell you!" said the squire, in a tone so fierce
that the nurse paused in her unfolding of the packet, and handed it
with fear and trembling to the already indignant O'Grady. But it is
only imagination can figure the outrageous fury of the squire, when,
on opening the envelope with his own hand, he beheld the law process
before him. There, in the heart of his castle, with his bars, and bolts,
and bull-dogs, and blunderbusses round him, he was served--absolutely
served,--and he had no doubt the nurse-tender was bribed to betray him.

Both Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Ben Allen had beheld these symptoms of
rivalry and hatred, with a degree of delight which imparted great
additional relish to the cigars at which they were puffing most
vigorously. The moment they began to flag, the mischievous Mr. Bob
Sawyer, addressing Slurk with great politeness, said:

“No,” replied Orient again; “have you?”

By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.

"Well, I won't, any how," said Andy, who by this time had got the
horse into a good high trot, that shook every word of argument out of
Paudeen's body; besides, it was as much as the boys could do to keep
their seats on Owny's Bucephalus, who was not long in reaching the
miller's bridge. Here voice and rein were employed to pull him in, that
he might cross the narrow wooden structure at a quiet pace. But whether
his double load had given him the idea of double exertion, or that the
pair of legs on each side sticking into his flanks (and perhaps the
horse was ticklish) made him go the faster, we know not: but the horse
charged the bridge as if an Enniskilliner were on his back, and an enemy
before him; and in two minutes his hoofs cluttered like thunder on the
bridge, that did not bend beneath him. No, it did _not_ bend, but it
broke: proving the falsehood of the boast, "I may break, but I won't
bend:" for, after all, the really strong may bend, and be as strong as
ever: it is the unsound, that has only the seeming of strength, that
breaks at last when it resists too long.

He left off scraping his chin, and sucked in his cheeks until they
seemed to meet inside; keeping his sidelong glance upon me all the
while.

Her brother took a book sometimes, but never read it that I saw. He
would open it and look at it as if he were reading, but would remain for
a whole hour without turning the leaf, and then put it down and walk to
and fro in the room. I used to sit with folded hands watching him, and
counting his footsteps, hour after hour. He very seldom spoke to her,
and never to me. He seemed to be the only restless thing, except the
clocks, in the whole motionless house.

I said, “No doubt.” I meant as to Holborn.

“Fagin’s, eh!” exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. “Wot an inwalable boy
that’ll make, for the old ladies’ pockets in chapels! His mug is a
fortin’ to him.”

‘It would be particularly comfortable, I think,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
‘Mr. Pott, what do you say?’

If it had lasted any longer, I think I must have gone down on my knees
on the gravel, with the probability before me of grazing them, and of
being presently ejected from the premises besides. But, by good fortune
the greenhouse was not far off, and these words brought us to it.

‘No sweethearts, I b’lieve?’

It was an awful sort of fishing, but it no more disconcerted Mr
Inspector than if he had been fishing in a punt on a summer evening by
some soothing weir high up the peaceful river. After certain minutes,
and a few directions to the rest to ‘ease her a little for’ard,’ and
‘now ease her a trifle aft,’ and the like, he said composedly, ‘All
clear!’ and the line and the boat came free together.

“But a change came upon the view, almost imperceptibly. The scene was
altered to a small bed-room, where the fairest and youngest child lay
dying; the roses had fled from his cheek, and the light from his eye;
and even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never
felt or known before, he died. His young brothers and sisters crowded
round his little bed, and seized his tiny hand, so cold and heavy; but
they shrunk back from its touch, and looked with awe on his infant face;
for calm and tranquil as it was, and sleeping in rest and peace as the
beautiful child seemed to be, they saw that he was dead, and they knew
that he was an angel looking down upon, and blessing them, from a bright
and happy Heaven.”

Chapter 33

"The measure of the unhappy woman's misery and misfortune was
about to be completed. Numerous offences had been committed in the
neighbourhood; the perpetrators remained undiscovered, and their
boldness increased. A robbery of a daring and aggravated nature
occasioned a vigilance of pursuit, and a strictness of search, they had
not calculated on. Young Edmunds was suspected, with three companions.
He was apprehended--committed--tried--condemned--to die.

‘No,’ said Mark, ‘I don’t.’

‘Yes,’ cried Tigg, ‘when there was a very charming and delightful little
family party, at which yourself and your respected father assisted.’

DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Thursday Morning, April 3rd, 1851._

Dear Jack,—All up at Coketown.  Bored out of the place, and going in
    for camels.

Peg demanded what he laughed at, but no answer was returned. Newman’s
arm could no longer be restrained; the bellows, descending heavily and
with unerring aim on the very centre of Mr. Squeers’s head, felled him to
the floor, and stretched him on it flat and senseless.

And the stately ships go on
       To their haven under the hill;
    But O for the touch of a vanish’d hand.
       And the sound of a voice that is still!

Entrenched in her pride and power, and with all the obduracy of her
spirit summoned about her, still her old conviction that she and her
mother had been known by this man in their worst colours, from their
first acquaintance; that every degradation she had suffered in her own
eyes was as plain to him as to herself; that he read her life as though
it were a vile book, and fluttered the leaves before her in slight
looks and tones of voice which no one else could detect; weakened and
undermined her. Proudly as she opposed herself to him, with her
commanding face exacting his humility, her disdainful lip repulsing
him, her bosom angry at his intrusion, and the dark lashes of her eyes
sullenly veiling their light, that no ray of it might shine upon
him—and submissively as he stood before her, with an entreating injured
manner, but with complete submission to her will—she knew, in her own
soul, that the cases were reversed, and that the triumph and
superiority were his, and that he knew it full well.

At the same time, bringing her thoughts as well as her sight to bear upon
the candle-grease, and becoming abruptly reminiscent of its healing
qualities as a balsam, she anointed her left elbow with a plentiful
application of that remedy.

‘“Hark!” said the old man. “He cries once more. He is alive yet.
Heyling, save him, save him!”

Oh Jip, miserable Spaniel, this wretchedness, then, was your work!

There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe
there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and
flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal
admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,
it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as
Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small
atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at
last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest
Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to
the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss
Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to
bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.

BROADSTAIRS, KENT, _July 11th, 1851._

The reply made me smile, for I doubted not he would have served me, if
set at liberty, in his own peculiar way.

"What, man," urged the captain, "don't give in!  Be up and doing _like_ a
man!"

_Dictionnaire de la Noblesse de France_, 3.

Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour
was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked
their journey down. Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but
remained in a separate room. The two other gentlemen hurried in and
out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they
were present, conversed apart. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away,
and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes
swollen with weeping. All these things made Rose and Oliver, who
were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. They sat
wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke
in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own
voices.

"What is the name," said I, "of the great black mountain there on the
other side?"

He was a young man; with deep black hair and eyes. He was gaunt and
pale; and evidently had not long recovered from a severe illness. He
stood as Martin entered, but sat again at John’s desire. His eyes were
cast downward; and but for one glance at them both, half in humiliation
and half in entreaty, he kept them so, and sat quite still and silent.

"You'll be all right then, sir," says Cobbs, "with your beautiful
sweetheart by your side."

‘Hard, indeed, ma’am,’ replied the beadle. ‘Anti-porochial weather
this, ma’am. We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a
matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very
blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.’

“My dear Major Bagstock,” says Mr Dombey, with a gratified air, “you
are quite warm.”

‘Oh!’ said Dick, with extreme politeness.  ‘Then you may hand it over,
Sir.  And if you’re to wait for an answer, Sir, you may wait in the
passage, Sir, which is an airy and well-ventilated apartment, sir.’

But as young dropsy evinced no symptoms of returning animation, Sam
Weller sat himself down in front of the cart, and starting the old
horse with a jerk of the rein, jogged steadily on, towards Manor Farm.

[[[‘THE DEFENDERS’ AND ‘ORANGE LODGES’]]]

This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,
and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.

"Harry, my dear boy! Harry!"

‘Except--’ I suggest.

"We shall very likely be up with another covey in five minutes," said
the long gamekeeper. "If the gentleman begins to fire now, perhaps
he'll just get the shot out of the barrel by the time they rise."

‘The other way--the other way,’ she cried. ‘He went the other way.
Turn--turn!’

Walter bowed.

‘These rubbers,’ said Mr Swiveller, putting on his nightcap in exactly
the same style as he wore his hat, ‘remind me of the matrimonial
fireside.  Cheggs’s wife plays cribbage; all-fours likewise.  She rings
the changes on ‘em now.  From sport to sport they hurry her to banish
her regrets, and when they win a smile from her, they think that she
forgets--but she don’t.  By this time, I should say,’ added Richard,
getting his left cheek into profile, and looking complacently at the
reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the looking-glass; ‘by
this time, I should say, the iron has entered into her soul.  It serves
her right!’

I then expounded to Miss Mills what I had endeavoured, so very
unsuccessfully, to expound to Dora. Miss Mills replied, on general
principles, that the Cottage of content was better than the Palace of
cold splendour, and that where love was, all was.

I anticipated the woman's thoughts.

There was a small Protestant cemetery near the city walls, and as Mr.
Kindheart came back to me, he turned into it and chose the spot.  He was
always highly flushed when rendering a service unaided, and I knew that
to make him happy I must keep aloof from his ministration.  But when at
dinner he warmed with the good action of the day, and conceived the
brilliant idea of comforting the mourner with ‘an English funeral,’ I
ventured to intimate that I thought that institution, which was not
absolutely sublime at home, might prove a failure in Italian hands.
However, Mr. Kindheart was so enraptured with his conception, that he
presently wrote down into the town requesting the attendance with
to-morrow’s earliest light of a certain little upholsterer.  This
upholsterer was famous for speaking the unintelligible local dialect (his
own) in a far more unintelligible manner than any other man alive.

My love was so much in my mind and it was so natural to me to confide in
Peggotty, when I found her again by my side of an evening with the old
set of industrial implements, busily making the tour of my wardrobe,
that I imparted to her, in a sufficiently roundabout way, my great
secret. Peggotty was strongly interested, but I could not get her into
my view of the case at all. She was audaciously prejudiced in my favour,
and quite unable to understand why I should have any misgivings, or be
low-spirited about it. ‘The young lady might think herself well off,’
she observed, ‘to have such a beau. And as to her Pa,’ she said, ‘what
did the gentleman expect, for gracious sake!’

‘We saved our recommendation, honest fellow,’ said Eugene, ‘for the next
candidate—the one who will offer himself when you are transported or
hanged. Don’t be long about it; will you be so good?’

I touched the brother jurymen whose place was next me, and I whispered to
him, “Oblige me by counting us.”  He looked surprised by the request, but
turned his head and counted. “Why,” says he, suddenly, “we are Thirt—;
but no, it’s not possible.  No.  We are twelve.”

“To make his fortune,” Mr Carker repeated, in the same dumb manner.

"But you have heard of him!" I exclaimed; "what has become of him?"

‘This is my friend,’ Mortimer Lightwood interposed; ‘Mr Eugene
Wrayburn.’

SKETCHES OF YOUNG COUPLES

We had a beautiful little dinner. Quite an elegant dish of fish; the
kidney-end of a loin of veal, roasted; fried sausage-meat; a partridge,
and a pudding. There was wine, and there was strong ale; and after
dinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands.

“May I ask, sir, what is—”

Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked
with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was
in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were
dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous
tenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high;
but this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in
his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant
stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle’s mind, too great for
utterance.

“Mrs. Lomax--what Mrs. Lomax?”

‘Good-bye, boy,’ said the man.

*       *       *       *       *

"Did she say nothing when she took the child away?  Search your memory.
She must have said something."

“Oh, it’s not at night, Papa,” returned the child, “it’s in the day;
and I lie down in Florence’s lap, and she sings to me. At night I dream
about such cu-ri-ous things!”

‘From whom and what about?’ inquired Nicholas. ‘You are unusually
mysterious tonight.’

"Who," says Grimaldi, with profound respect and an air of great
mystery,--"Who this gentleman was, I never could ascertain; but that he
was a person possessing a somewhat high degree of authority was evident
to me from the great respect paid to him at the Police-office. Some one
afterwards told me he was a city marshal, possessing power to exercise
his authority without the city; but I know not whether he was so or
not."

"Don't talk of it," replied Mr. Jingle. He stopped short, as if
suddenly recollecting something, and said--"By-the-bye--can't spare ten
pounds, can you?--very particular purpose--pay you in three days."

A bottle standing on one corner of the bureau had not been removed. It
was clear that the plunderers had gone direct to the chest, of which
they must have possessed a key, for the lock, though strained, had not
been forced. Maddened by these reflections, and unable to account for
the occurrence, he again vented his fury in words. ‘I have it!’ he
shrieked, ‘it is that accursed Welsh baronet who has robbed me. He paid
me the money in this public way only to delude me. I’ll charge him with
the robbery--I’ll prove it against him--I’ll hang him! Oh! it would
delight me to hang him! I would give a thousand pounds to see it done!
A thousand pounds! What is that to the fourteen thousand I have lost?
I shall go mad, and it were happy for me to do so. Philip Frewin will
refuse to marry my daughter. Her portion is gone--gone! Why was I
tempted forth with Firebras? I ought to have taken my seat on that
chest--to have eaten my meals upon it--to have slept upon it! Night nor
day should I have quitted it! Fool that I have been!

Nicholas laughed in very unexpected enjoyment of this performance; and
the ladies, by way of encouragement, laughed louder than before; whereat
Mr. Lenville assumed his bitterest smile, and expressed his opinion that
they were ‘minions’.

And the Cricket and the kettle, turning up again, acknowledged it!  The
bright fire, blazing up again, acknowledged it!  The little Mower on the
clock, in his unheeded work, acknowledged it!  The Carrier, in his
smoothing forehead and expanding face, acknowledged it, the readiest of
all.

‘Really I don’t know about that,’ observed Traddles thoughtfully. ‘Many
people can be very mean, when they give their minds to it.’

‘Oh, you are confused, are you?’ said the magistrate. ‘Mr. Jinks, you
observe this confusion?’

‘What have you been?’ asked Mr Boffin.

‘Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching
Hell-babe,’ cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging
the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. ‘That door.
Quick!’ He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. ‘Is the
downstairs door fast?’

‘Does he live in Scarborough?’ I asked.

‘Jest this, sir,’ Mrs Gamp returned, ‘with thanks to you for asking.
There IS a gent, sir, at the Bull in Holborn, as has been took ill
there, and is bad abed. They have a day nurse as was recommended from
Bartholomew’s; and well I knows her, Mr Mould, her name bein’ Mrs Prig,
the best of creeturs. But she is otherways engaged at night, and they
are in wants of night-watching; consequent she says to them, having
reposed the greatest friendliness in me for twenty year, “The soberest
person going, and the best of blessings in a sick room, is Mrs Gamp.
Send a boy to Kingsgate Street,” she says, “and snap her up at any
price, for Mrs Gamp is worth her weight and more in goldian guineas.”
 My landlord brings the message down to me, and says, “bein’ in a light
place where you are, and this job promising so well, why not unite the
two?” “No, sir,” I says, “not unbeknown to Mr Mould, and therefore do
not think it. But I will go to Mr Mould,” I says, “and ast him, if you
like.”’ Here she looked sideways at the undertaker, and came to a stop.

‘No, John!’ cried Bella, laying her hand upon his lips, with a proud
look. ‘Never to me!’

When I landed at Cività Vecchia from the steamer, I inquired of the
landlord of the inn whether the redoubtable Barbone was still an inmate
of the fortress; and, on his answering in the affirmative, obtained
an order to visit the place. Under the escort of one of the Pope's
carabiniers, behold me then in the shadow of that colossal edifice!

Throughout these singular freedoms on the part of Mr Blandois, which
involved a general alteration in his demeanour, making it much coarser
and rougher, much more violent and audacious than before, Mr Flintwinch,
whose leathern face was not liable to many changes, preserved its
immobility intact. Beyond now appearing perhaps, to have been left
hanging a trifle too long before that friendly operation of cutting
down, he outwardly maintained an equable composure. They had brought
their survey to a close in the little room at the side of the hall, and
he stood there, eyeing Mr Blandois.

EDITED BY

‘She’s fast enough till the tide runs back. I couldn’t make her faster
than she is. Come aboard of mine, and see for your own-selves.’

I say nothing of what may be called the domestic noises of the ship: such
as the breaking of glass and crockery, the tumbling down of stewards, the
gambols, overhead, of loose casks and truant dozens of bottled porter,
and the very remarkable and far from exhilarating sounds raised in their
various state-rooms by the seventy passengers who were too ill to get up
to breakfast.  I say nothing of them: for although I lay listening to
this concert for three or four days, I don’t think I heard it for more
than a quarter of a minute, at the expiration of which term, I lay down
again, excessively sea-sick.

‘It is,’ replied Rose, ‘that you must endeavour to forget me; not
as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me
deeply; but, as the object of your love. Look into the world; think
how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some
other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and
most faithful friend you have.’

"Niall!" said Malachi. The youth was at the feet of the king. In a
moment the maid was there also. Malachi stood with folded arms, looking
thoughtfully and somewhat sternly down upon the prostrate pair. No one
broke silence for a time.

I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”

Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to
all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and
praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.
They would be done long before Sunday, he said.

The time and circumstances were favourable to reflection.  He tried to
keep his thoughts to the current, unpleasant though it was, in which they
had moved all day, and to think with what a romantic feeling he had
looked forward to shaking his old friend by the hand before he died, and
what a wide and cruel difference there was between the meeting they had
had, and that which he had so often and so long anticipated.  Still, he
was disordered by waking to such sudden loneliness, and could not prevent
his mind from running upon odd tales of people of undoubted courage, who,
being shut up by night in vaults or churches, or other dismal places, had
scaled great heights to get out, and fled from silence as they had never
done from danger.  This brought to his mind the moonlight through the
window, and bethinking himself of it, he groped his way back up the
crooked stairs,—but very stealthily, as though he were fearful of being
overheard.

"So are you, sir," said Pott, addressing Mr. Ben Allen.

Mr. Winkle, to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed, made no
reply. He turned away his head, and appeared absorbed in melancholy
reflection.

“There—there’s enough of that,” interposed Sikes, impatiently; and
stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his
ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a
long stare of astonishment.

WHY THE WIND BLOWS ROUND ST. PAUL'S.

Forget that I called those two women my dear friends! Why, if I told you
a fiftieth part of what I have thought about them, you would write me
the most suspicious of notes, refusing to receive the fiftieth part of
that. So I don't write, particularly as you laid your injunctions on me
concerning Ruth. In revenge, I will now mention one word that I wish you
would take out whenever you reprint that book. She would never--I am
ready to make affidavit before any authority in the land--have called
her seducer "Sir," when they were living at that hotel in Wales. A girl
pretending to be what she really was would have done it, but she--never!

Some new remembrance of the ghostly figures in the Bells; some faint
impression of the ringing of the Chimes; some giddy consciousness of
having seen the swarm of phantoms reproduced and reproduced until the
recollection of them lost itself in the confusion of their numbers; some
hurried knowledge, how conveyed to him he knew not, that more years had
passed; and Trotty, with the Spirit of the child attending him, stood
looking on at mortal company.

"Do I? Well, take the rest of the message. Tell her that Sam loved her
through the whole; that, when he heard she was free, he began to work
hard at making a fortune. He has got it; and he is coming to share it
with her, if she will let him. Will you tell her this?"

It was not in point of actual conversation that Mr Willet shone so
brilliantly, for he had none of his old cronies to ‘tackle,’ and was
rather timorous of venturing on Joe; having certain vague misgivings
within him, that he was ready on the shortest notice, and on receipt of
the slightest offence, to fell the Black Lion to the floor of his own
parlour, and immediately to withdraw to China or some other remote and
unknown region, there to dwell for evermore, or at least until he had
got rid of his remaining arm and both legs, and perhaps an eye or so,
into the bargain. It was with a peculiar kind of pantomime that Mr
Willet filled up every pause; and in this he was considered by the Black
Lion, who had been his familiar for some years, quite to surpass and
go beyond himself, and outrun the expectations of his most admiring
friends.

‘Your marriage, Fanny?’

“Is not Miss Isabel generous?” asked she, as she held the milk-pot to be
admired.

Point the first is this. Veneering institutes an original comparison
between the country, and a ship; pointedly calling the ship, the Vessel
of the State, and the Minister the Man at the Helm. Veneering’s object
is to let Pocket-Breaches know that his friend on his right (Podsnap) is
a man of wealth. Consequently says he, ‘And, gentlemen, when the timbers
of the Vessel of the State are unsound and the Man at the Helm is
unskilful, would those great Marine Insurers, who rank among our
world-famed merchant-princes—would they insure her, gentlemen? Would
they underwrite her? Would they incur a risk in her? Would they have
confidence in her? Why, gentlemen, if I appealed to my honourable friend
upon my right, himself among the greatest and most respected of that
great and much respected class, he would answer No!’

“NOT a party in anything, ma’am?” says Mr. Guppy.

[Sidenote: Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton.]

Pip watched him trying to file the iron off his leg, and then being
afraid of stopping longer away from home, he ran off.

‘_Ten minutes past nine_.

‘Is it?’ he cried, with great eagerness. ‘Now, for any liberal sum of
money that could be agreed upon, Venus, would you put it in the fire?’

"I'll try what I can do, sir," said Twigger.

‘And yet I always liked you, Copperfield!’ he rejoined.

“Why, you’re just the very person for it,” reasoned Mr. Sikes: “nobody
about here knows anything of you.”

‘I have been thinking, Kit,’ said the lawyer, ‘that I could throw some
little emoluments in your mother’s way--You have a mother, I think?  If
I recollect right, you told me--’

"And your master, young man! A gentleman with money, as could never
feel the expense of a wife, no more than nothing," continued Mrs.
Cluppins, with great volubility; "why there ain't the faintest shade of
an excuse for his behaviour! Why don't he marry her?"

‘Quite natural! And have been drinking together, eh?’ pursued Sir John.
‘Did you say what place you went to in company, when you left Lord
George’s?’

"Gone?"

"I thought it better to come myself," said Mr. Pickwick, addressing
Mr. Winkle, as Sam disencumbered him of his great-coat and travelling
shawl, "to ascertain, before I gave my consent to Sam's employment in
this matter, that you are quite in earnest and serious, with respect to
this young lady."

"But, sir, he has no right--"

Johns, Richard, paper by, 521.

Ever faithfully.

Sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene, that he
suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded.
It was not until it had been twice repeated, each time in a shriller
tone, that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour.

1846.

‘By advertising,’ said Mrs. Micawber--‘in all the papers. It appears to
me, that what Mr. Micawber has to do, in justice to himself, in justice
to his family, and I will even go so far as to say in justice to
society, by which he has been hitherto overlooked, is to advertise in
all the papers; to describe himself plainly as so-and-so, with such and
such qualifications and to put it thus: “Now employ me, on remunerative
terms, and address, post-paid, to W. M., Post Office, Camden Town.”’

He sought to raise himself a little. Allan raised him so that she
could hold him on her bosom, which was what he wanted.

"Oh you wicked old rascal!" cried one voice, "looking arter the girls,
are you?"

"See!" answered Doctor Heidegger.

He tottered to his chair.  He felt her draw his arms about her neck: he
felt her put her own round his; he felt her kisses on his face; he felt
her wet cheek laid against his own; he felt--oh, how deeply!--all that
he had done.

“Stay,” cried Redlaw with an earnestness to which he could not give
enough expression. “For a moment! As an act of mercy! I know that some
change fell upon me, when those sounds were in the air just now. Tell
me, have I lost the power of harming her? May I go near her without
dread? Oh, let her give me any sign of hope!”

“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up. Pray make
the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I
drink to you.”

The King was beginning, "Might I ask the reason--?" when the Fairy became
absolutely furious.

In a later stage of the dinner: that is to say, when the Native stood
at the Major’s elbow ready to serve the first bottle of champagne: the
Major became still slyer.

“Such a thing might be,” said Mr. Grewgious, pondering.

[96] The following inscription is on his grave-stone:--

"Have you travelled so far, then?" she inquired.

'Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth,
      Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.'

‘I beg your pardon, Mr Headstone, but I couldn’t help wondering what in
the world brought HIM here!’

"That's right."

Grimaldi ran to the stage-door, and asked the porter if his brother had
passed. The man said he had, not a minute back; he could not have got
out of the street by that time.

Why must the flowers die?
Prisoned they lie
In the cold tomb, heedless of tears or rain.
Oh doubting heart!
They only sleep below
The soft white ermine snow,
While winter winds shall blow,
To breathe and smile upon you soon again.

"I think not, sir."

"ALL THE YEAR ROUND" OFFICE, _Tuesday, June 11th, 1861._

“Now, Ben,” cried the coachman impatiently.

What London pedestrian is there who has not, at some time or other,
cast a hurried glance through the wicket at which prisoners are
admitted into this gloomy mansion, and surveyed the few objects he
could discern, with an indescribable feeling of curiosity? The thick
door, plated with iron and mounted with spikes, just low enough to
enable you to see, leaning over them, an ill-looking fellow, in a
broad-brimmed hat, Belcher handkerchief and top-boots: with a brown
coat, something between a great-coat and a ‘sporting’ jacket, on his
back, and an immense key in his left hand. Perhaps you are lucky enough
to pass, just as the gate is being opened; then, you see on the other
side of the lodge, another gate, the image of its predecessor, and two
or three more turnkeys, who look like multiplications of the first one,
seated round a fire which just lights up the whitewashed apartment
sufficiently to enable you to catch a hasty glimpse of these different
objects. We have a great respect for Mrs. Fry, but she certainly ought
to have written more romances than Mrs. Radcliffe.

‘You don’t tell me so, my dear!’

Mr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower
down. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir
Leicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a
stately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging
among the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my
Lady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,
being priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the
papers on the table—looks at them nearer—looks at them nearer
still—asks impulsively, “Who copied that?”

"Dodson and Fogg," replied the man; "execution on cognovit for costs."

'What do you mean by that, Sam?' said Mr. Pickwick.  He raised
    himself in bed, and extended his hand, as if he were about to say
    something more; but suddenly checking himself, turned round, and bade
    his valet 'Good night.'

"I descended--as I might have known I should, but that he fascinated me
with his boyish courtship--into a doll, a trifle for the occupation of
an idle hour, to be dropped, and taken up, and trifled with, as the
inconstant humour took him. When he grew weary, I grew weary. As his
fancy died out, I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I
had, than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for
his wife. We fell away from one another without a word. Perhaps you saw
it, and were not sorry. Since then, I have been a mere disfigured piece
of furniture between you both; having no eyes, no ears, no feelings, no
remembrances. Moan? Moan for what you made him; not for your love. I
tell you that the time was, when I loved him better than you ever did!"

“You spoke, just now, of my being mother’s favourite, long ago. It’s a
dreadful thing to think now, of long ago!”

‘ARE you going to speak to me, master, or am I to go away?’

“_What’s_ the matter?”

"What are you doing on my grounds?" said the black man, with a hoarse,
growling voice.

"Ah!" said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth
again; "the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave
him in the cellar for a day or so, till he's a little starved down; and
then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through his
apprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs.
Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his made
her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any
well-disposed woman, weeks before."

Mrs Veneering welcomes her sweet Mr Twemlow. Mr Veneering welcomes
his dear Twemlow. Mrs Veneering does not expect that Mr Twemlow can in
nature care much for such insipid things as babies, but so old a friend
must please to look at baby. ‘Ah! You will know the friend of your
family better, Tootleums,’ says Mr Veneering, nodding emotionally at
that new article, ‘when you begin to take notice.’ He then begs to make
his dear Twemlow known to his two friends, Mr Boots and Mr Brewer—and
clearly has no distinct idea which is which.

"Wot a old image it is!" exclaimed Sam, indignant at this loss of time.
"What are you a settin' down there for, conwertin' your face into
a street-door knocker, ven there's so much to be done? Where's the
money?"

“Edith, by all means,” said Mr Dombey.

‘I am sorry it is not the larger presentation,’ said my lady, rather
coldly; ‘though I will not, Mr. Silverman, pay you the bad compliment of
supposing that _you_ are, because that would be mercenary,—and mercenary
I am persuaded you are not.’

THE old man had gained the street corner before he began to recover
the effect of Toby Crackit’s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of
his unusual speed, but was still pressing onward in the same wild and
disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage, and a
boisterous cry from the foot-passengers, who saw his danger, drove
him back upon the pavement. Avoiding as much as possible all the main
streets, and skulking only through the byways and alleys, he at length
emerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than before; nor did
he linger until he had again turned into a court, when, as if conscious
that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual
shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.

Deferring to his son's feeling upon this point, Mr. Weller at once
sought the erudite Solomon Pell, and acquainted him with his desire to
issue a writ, instantly, for the sum of twenty-five pounds, and costs
of process; to be executed without delay upon the body of one Samuel
Weller; the charges thereby incurred to be paid in advance to Solomon
Pell.

Mrs Lammle disdained to reply, and sat defiantly beating one foot on the
ground.

Mr. Pickwick had never held any personal communication with Mr. Winkle
senior, although he had once or twice corresponded with him by letter,
and returned satisfactory answers to his inquiries concerning the moral
character and behaviour of his son; he felt nervously sensible that
to wait upon him, for the first time, attended by Bob Sawyer and Ben
Allen, both slightly fuddled, was not the most ingenious and likely
means that could have been hit upon to prepossess him in his favour.

"Calm yourself," said Mr. Tupman, affected almost to tears by this
expression of sympathy with his sufferings. "Dear, dear madam, calm
yourself."

“Oh my lad! dunnot speak so to me, or my heart will break outright,”
said his mother, with a sort of cry. Then she calmed herself, for she
yearned to persuade him to her own belief. “Thou never asked, and
thou’rt too like thy father for me to tell without asking--but it were
all to be near Lizzie’s old place that I settled down on this side o’
Manchester; and the very day after we came, I went to her old misses,
and asked to speak a word wi’ her. I had a strong mind to cast it up to
her, that she should ha’ sent my poor lass away without telling on it to
us first; but she were in black, and looked so sad I could na’ find in
my heart to threep it up. But I did ask her a bit about our Lizzie. The
master would have turned her away at a day’s warning, (he’s gone to
t’other place; I hope he’ll meet wi’ more mercy there than he showed our
Lizzie,--I do,--) and when the missus asked her should she write to us,
she says Lizzie shook her head; and when she speered at her again, the
poor lass went down on her knees, and begged her not, for she said it
would break my heart, (as it has done, Will--God knows it has),” said
the poor mother, choking with her struggle to keep down her hard
overmastering grief, “and her father would curse her--Oh God, teach me
to be patient.” She could not speak for a few minutes,--“and the lass
threatened, and said she’d go drown herself in the canal, if the missus
wrote home,--and so--

While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked
with her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she
stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it
some seconds,—

"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!"

It was a bright morning in June when Nell and her grandfather set forth
upon their travels.  Out of the city they walked briskly, for the desire
to leave their old life--to elude pursuit--lay strong upon them.  Nell
had provided a simple lunch for that day's needs; and at night they
stopped foot-sore and weary at a hospitable farmhouse.

“I thought so. That’s sufficient. You can go. So you are the man,”
says Mr. Tulkinghorn, opening his door with the key, “in whose
hiding-place Mr. Gridley was found?”

Mr. Pott darted a look of contempt, which might have withered an anchor.

‘Cobb,’ said Solomon Daisy, dropping his voice and appealing to the
post-office keeper; ‘what day of the month is this?’

‘Yes sure!’ said she, when the business was opened, ‘Mrs Milvey had the
kindness to write to me, ma’am, and I got Sloppy to read it. It was a
pretty letter. But she’s an affable lady.’

“Ah!” says Mr. George, resuming his breakfast. “And where’s the
tinker?”

The Magra safely crossed in the Ferry Boat—the passage is not by any
means agreeable, when the current is swollen and strong—we arrived at
Carrara, within a few hours.  In good time next morning, we got some
ponies, and went out to see the marble quarries.

“Don’t let us come to that, Rosa; or I shall want more pardoning than I
like to think of.”

“Your wife wants money, I suppose,” said Mr Dombey, putting his hand in
his pocket, and speaking (but that he always did) haughtily.

The two shook hands with the greatest heartiness, and then went the
wonderful length—for Englishmen—of laying their hands each on the
other’s shoulders, and looking joyfully each into the other’s face.

The tone of society in Boston is one of perfect politeness, courtesy, and
good breeding.  The ladies are unquestionably very beautiful—in face: but
there I am compelled to stop.  Their education is much as with us;
neither better nor worse.  I had heard some very marvellous stories in
this respect; but not believing them, was not disappointed.  Blue ladies
there are, in Boston; but like philosophers of that colour and sex in
most other latitudes, they rather desire to be thought superior than to
be so.  Evangelical ladies there are, likewise, whose attachment to the
forms of religion, and horror of theatrical entertainments, are most
exemplary.  Ladies who have a passion for attending lectures are to be
found among all classes and all conditions.  In the kind of provincial
life which prevails in cities such as this, the Pulpit has great
influence.  The peculiar province of the Pulpit in New England (always
excepting the Unitarian Ministry) would appear to be the denouncement of
all innocent and rational amusements.  The church, the chapel, and the
lecture-room, are the only means of excitement excepted; and to the
church, the chapel, and the lecture-room, the ladies resort in crowds.

‘Brighton?’ Mr. Cymon Tuggs opposed an insurmountable objection. All
the coaches had been upset, in turn, within the last three weeks; each
coach had averaged two passengers killed, and six wounded; and, in
every case, the newspapers had distinctly understood that ‘no blame
whatever was attributable to the coachman.’

‘Fine thing,’ said the old gentleman, ‘education a great thing: a very
great thing! I never had any. I admire it the more in others. A very
fine thing. Yes, yes. Tell me more of your history. Let me hear it all.
No impertinent curiosity--no, no, no.’

‘What old man?’

"'Yes, I did, Mr. Lobbs. I did come after your daughter. I love her,
Mr. Lobbs.'

THE LAST OF THE BANDITS.

MY DEAR KENT,

And Betty found that it was of no use; that it did only kick his monkey
up, and so she let him alone, except when she could drop in a persuasive
word or two. The mill-owners at Cressbrook and Miller’s Dale had
forbidden any public-house nearer than Edale, and they had more than
once called the people together to point out to them the mischiefs of
drinking, and the advantages to be derived from the very savings of
temperance. But all these measures, though they had some effect on the
mill people, had very little on the miners. They either sent to
Tideswell or Edale for kegs of beer to peddle at the mines, or they
went thither themselves on receiving their wages.

"Think not, sir?" inquired Mr. Weller.

‘Why, this is the very thing, aunt!’ said I, flushed with the possible
dignity of living in chambers.

‘Don’t stir, then,’ said Gowan coolly, as the sisters approached the
easel. ‘Let the ladies at least see the original of the daub, that they
may know what it’s meant for. There he stands, you see. A bravo waiting
for his prey, a distinguished noble waiting to save his country, the
common enemy waiting to do somebody a bad turn, an angelic messenger
waiting to do somebody a good turn--whatever you think he looks most
like!’

‘I can’t be calm,’ cried Mr Pecksniff, ‘and I won’t be quiet. My
benefactor and my friend! Shall even my house be no refuge for your
hoary pillow!’

“It can’t be, sir. It cannot be,” said the old lady energetically.

I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was quite
mistaken; for she laid aside her work (which was a stocking of her own)
and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and gave it a
good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being very plump,
whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed, some of the
buttons on the back of her flew off. And I recollect two bursting to the
opposite side of the parlor while she was hugging me.

‘Was there no one by?’ asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; ‘No
sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and
might, by possibility, understand?’

Bromley had just issued from it, and was wringing his hands, and
stamping his naked feet upon the pavement. He recognised me, and seized
me wildly by the arms.

“Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him. Would you mind
describing him to me?”

"Have never walked forth with the younger members of
my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers
born in these later years?" pursued the Phantom.

THE READERS'S LIBRARY

"Do what is necessary," at last he uttered; then, pulling his hat more
over his eyes, he continued to pace the quarter-deck.

"This," said the man: "I saw three boys--two two others and the prisoner
here--loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was
reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done; and I
saw this boy was perfectly amazed and stupefied by it."

Kiss the noble Plorn a dozen times for me, and tell him I drank his
health yesterday, and wished him many happy returns of the day; also
that I hope he will not have broken all his toys before I come back.

"He must be a first-rater," said Sam.

"Jacob Kats, my boy!" exclaimed the giant, in that quiet patronising
kind of voice all great men affect, carelessly balancing Jacob on his
finger and thumb at a little distance from his mouth, as he threw out
a long wreath of acrid smoke; "Jacob, you are a capital pipe,--there's
no denying _that_. You smoke admirably,--take my word for it;" and
then, without a word of pity or consolation, he resumed his unnatural
fumigations with more fierceness than ever. Jacob had behaved like a
martyr,--he had shown a spirit worthy of the Kats in their best days;
but the impertinence of such conduct was not to be endured. He would a
minute since have allowed himself to have been dried into a Westphalia
ham, to which state he had been rapidly progressing, but the insult
he had just received had roused the dormant spirit of resistance in
his nature; and, while every feature in his tyrant's smoky face seemed
illuminated with a thousand sardonic grins, having no better weapon
at hand, Jacob hastily snatched the red cap off his head, and, taking
deliberate aim at his persecutor, flung it bang into the very cock of
his eye. The monster opened his jaws to utter a yell of agony, and down
came the head of Jacob Kats upon the floor, that left him without sense
or motion.

‘Tell me she is well then,’ said Mr Pecksniff. ‘Tell me she is well my
boy!’

"Ay! there's no help for it, I suppose," said Steerforth. "I have almost
forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out
tossing on the sea here. I wish there was not."

"I am glad of that, Cobbs, because I like you, you know, and you're
going to live with us. Cobbs!"

The house stands, large and weather-proof, in the long dull street; but
it is a ruin, and the rats fly from it.

He had no sixpence, neither had the old lady, nor Mr Abel, nor the
Notary, nor Mr Chuckster.  The old gentleman thought a shilling too
much, but there was no shop in the street to get change at, so he gave
it to the boy.

At length all these weighty matters being arranged, a day was fixed for
selling out and transferring the stock, and of waiting with that view
upon Wilkins Flasher, Esq., stock-broker, of somewhere near the Bank,
who had been recommended by Mr. Solomon Pell for the purpose.

I lay my face upon the pillow by her, and she looks into my eyes, and
speaks very softly. Gradually, as she goes on, I feel, with a stricken
heart, that she is speaking of herself as past.

‘Why, I suppose the bills went out, and you came in. The acceptances
weren’t taken up, and you were, eh?’ inquired Walker.

"Here, ma'am?" said the magistrate. "Where, ma'am?"

‘A blessing on those voices!’ said the wayfarer. ‘I feel the beauty of
the night more keenly, when I hear them. They are like eyes to me. Will
they speak again, and cheer the heart of a poor traveller?’

In the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was going
to school; which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed. She
also informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come downstairs into
the parlour, and have my breakfast. There, I found my mother, very pale
and with red eyes: into whose arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my
suffering soul.

‘The very words was on my lips, sir,’ Mrs Gamp rejoined. ‘Suppoging
that the gent should die, I hope I might take the liberty of saying as I
know’d some one in the undertaking line, and yet give no offence to you,
sir?’

M. Todgers’s Commercial Boarding-House was a house of that sort which is
likely to be dark at any time; but that morning it was especially dark.
There was an odd smell in the passage, as if the concentrated essence of
all the dinners that had been cooked in the kitchen since the house was
built, lingered at the top of the kitchen stairs to that hour, and like
the Black Friar in Don Juan, ‘wouldn’t be driven away.’ In particular,
there was a sensation of cabbage; as if all the greens that had ever
been boiled there, were evergreens, and flourished in immortal strength.
The parlour was wainscoted, and communicated to strangers a magnetic
and instinctive consciousness of rats and mice. The staircase was very
gloomy and very broad, with balustrades so thick and heavy that they
would have served for a bridge. In a sombre corner on the first landing,
stood a gruff old giant of a clock, with a preposterous coronet of three
brass balls on his head; whom few had ever seen--none ever looked in the
face--and who seemed to continue his heavy tick for no other reason than
to warn heedless people from running into him accidentally. It had not
been papered or painted, hadn’t Todgers’s, within the memory of man. It
was very black, begrimed, and mouldy. And, at the top of the staircase,
was an old, disjointed, rickety, ill-favoured skylight, patched
and mended in all kinds of ways, which looked distrustfully down at
everything that passed below, and covered Todgers’s up as if it were a
sort of human cucumber-frame, and only people of a peculiar growth were
reared there.

Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was
alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing
that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the
same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by
her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and
appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt certain
she should rise in the morning, quite well.

"Pontius Pilate having been condemned to death for his crimes, to avert
the shame of a public execution, committed suicide. His body being
found, was by the enraged multitude fastened to an immense weight of
stones, and thrown into the Tyber. But the spirit of that noble river,
outraged by her waters being made the deposit of so foul a carcase,
from that hour rose in foam and torrent to resent the injury; and,
interesting great Nature in her behalf, the most frightful storms and
whirlwinds, with hail, thunder, and lightning, ravaged the whole country
from the Mediterranean shores to the opposite Adriatic; nor did the
elemental uproar cease until the terrified inhabitants, by dint of
the greatest exertions, dragged the body up again, and in all haste
caused it to be conveyed as far as Vienne in Dauphiny, and there anew
committed to the deep.[107] But what was the consequence? The Rhone
would no more suffer such an insult than had the Tyber; and its blue
waters, swelling with the indignity offered them, overflowed their
natural banks, and rushed with headlong rapidity, as if to fly the spot
of pollution. No bark could live an instant on the tremendous waves,
which now so frightfully disguised this hitherto calmly majestic stream;
and the Dauphinois, like the Romans, had no remedy for the crying
evil, but, as they had done, to rid themselves and their river of such
an ill-omened guest. This was at length accomplished: but the noble
Rhone, although cleansed of his 'filthy bargain,' could not so easily
forget the deep affront; and yearly, at that very season, he has ever
since marked his undying resentment by a repetition of the same angry
demonstrations. Meantime the offending cause of all this tribulation
was secretly transported to Lausanne, and there condemned to a third
watery grave. Why a preference so little flattering was given to this
beautiful spot, is not known; but certain it is that its inhabitants,
being made acquainted with the new arrival, presaged but little good
to their '_placid Leman_' from so confirmed a disturber of the silent
waters, and before his presence could have time to create its usual
uproar, and thus prevent or impede such a measure, the body was once
more brought to land; and, a council being held, it was then determined
that a small and isolated lake,[108] situated near the summit of the
Frakmont, should be the chosen place of interment. Being situated at a
good forty leagues from their city, they would at least have little to
dread from his future operations; and the bleak and barren nature of the
soil surrounding his new residence would, as they hoped, neutralize, if
not entirely destroy, his baneful influence.

10, CAMDEN CRESCENT, DOVER, _July 22nd, 1852._

Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a
pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for
my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other
similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle
and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of
architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,
was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.

The Jew nodded to him to take no further notice just then, and in a few
minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering
Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat
and bade him good-night. He paused when he reached the door, and
looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.

X.  A DOG'S TALE. By Mark Twain (1835)

At a more elevated desk in the centre, sat a very fat and red-faced
gentleman, in tortoise-shell spectacles, whose dignified appearance
announced the judge; and round a long green-baized table below,
something like a billiard-table without the cushions and pockets, were
a number of very self-important-looking personages, in stiff
neckcloths, and black gowns with white fur collars, whom we at once set
down as proctors. At the lower end of the billiard-table was an
individual in an arm-chair, and a wig, whom we afterwards discovered to
be the registrar; and seated behind a little desk, near the door, were
a respectable-looking man in black, of about twenty-stone weight or
thereabouts, and a fat-faced, smirking, civil-looking body, in a black
gown, black kid gloves, knee shorts, and silks, with a shirt-frill in
his bosom, curls on his head, and a silver staff in his hand, whom we
had no difficulty in recognising as the officer of the Court. The
latter, indeed, speedily set our mind at rest upon this point, for,
advancing to our elbow, and opening a conversation forthwith, he had
communicated to us, in less than five minutes, that he was the
apparitor, and the other the court-keeper; that this was the Arches
Court, and therefore the counsel wore red gowns, and the proctors fur
collars; and that when the other Courts sat there, they didn’t wear red
gowns or fur collars either; with many other scraps of intelligence
equally interesting. Besides these two officers, there was a little
thin old man, with long grizzly hair, crouched in a remote corner,
whose duty, our communicative friend informed us, was to ring a large
hand-bell when the Court opened in the morning, and who, for aught his
appearance betokened to the contrary, might have been similarly
employed for the last two centuries at least.

‘Well, then, look here,’ continued Sikes. ‘This is powder; that
‘ere’s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin’.’

“I am astonished at it.”

The first person who appeared was ‘my lord,’ habited in a blue coat and
bright buttons, with gilt paper tacked over the seams, yellow
knee-breeches, pink cotton stockings, and shoes; a cocked hat,
ornamented with shreds of various-coloured paper, on his head, a
_bouquet_ the size of a prize cauliflower in his button-hole, a long
Belcher handkerchief in his right hand, and a thin cane in his left. A
murmur of applause ran through the crowd (which was chiefly composed of
his lordship’s personal friends), when this graceful figure made his
appearance, which swelled into a burst of applause as his fair partner
in the dance bounded forth to join him. Her ladyship was attired in
pink crape over bed-furniture, with a low body and short sleeves. The
symmetry of her ankles was partially concealed by a very perceptible
pair of frilled trousers; and the inconvenience which might have
resulted from the circumstance of her white satin shoes being a few
sizes too large, was obviated by their being firmly attached to her
legs with strong tape sandals.

‘Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!’ cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and
in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of
Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so
much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,--which is
a very curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a
beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted
with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and
forgetfulness of personal dignity.

Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in
a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length
consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By
Fagin’s directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire,
a waggoner’s frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of
which articles the Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a
felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter’s whip.
Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country
fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the
gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly,
and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he
would look the part to perfection.

Ever your affectionate
                                                                   Jo.

I bowed.

Dread and fear were upon him, to an extent he had never counted on, and
could not manage in the least degree. He was so horribly afraid of that
infernal room at home. This made him, in a gloomy murderous, mad way,
not only fearful FOR himself, but OF himself; for being, as it were, a
part of the room: a something supposed to be there, yet missing from it:
he invested himself with its mysterious terrors; and when he pictured in
his mind the ugly chamber, false and quiet, false and quiet, through the
dark hours of two nights; and the tumbled bed, and he not in it, though
believed to be; he became in a manner his own ghost and phantom, and was
at once the haunting spirit and the haunted man.

Bella’s husband stepped softly to the half-door of the bar, and stood
there.

"Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?" inquired Steerforth.

“What do you mean, Sol Gills, my friend, by Number nine Brig Place?”
inquired the Captain.

A ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this
suggestion. Mr. Jingle perceived it, and followed up his advantage.

‘Upon my word!’ cried the old gentleman ironically.

"Last night, I believe."

In the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was
opened, and seeing his son’s place empty (he had not the courage to look
in at first) went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way
there.  To whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but
entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ
his son at a distance for a little while.  Also, that he was charged with
the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool’s memory, and declaring the
thief.  Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street
after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense
soap-bubble, without its beauty.

‘She sold it,’ cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; ‘did she sell
it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?’

‘To-night, Sir,’ replied Job.

He tried easy now; but the luck resisted; wouldn’t come.

Joe expressed his obligations, and continued, ‘You can trust me then,
and credit what I say. I believe I shall enlist in your regiment
to-night. The reason I don’t do so now is, because I don’t want until
to-night, to do what I can’t recall. Where shall I find you, this
evening?’

Letters to a Mother, by Susan E. Blow.

This Mr Swiveller gave them--faithfully as regarded the wishes and
character of the single gentleman, and poetically as concerned the
great trunk, of which he gave a description more remarkable for
brilliancy of imagination than a strict adherence to truth; declaring,
with many strong asseverations, that it contained a specimen of every
kind of rich food and wine, known in these times, and in particular
that it was of a self-acting kind and served up whatever was required,
as he supposed by clock-work. He also gave them to understand that the
cooking apparatus roasted a fine piece of sirloin of beef, weighing
about six pounds avoir-dupoise, in two minutes and a quarter, as he had
himself witnessed, and proved by his sense of taste; and further, that,
however the effect was produced, he had distinctly seen water boil and
bubble up when the single gentleman winked; from which facts he (Mr
Swiveller) was led to infer that the lodger was some great conjuror or
chemist, or both, whose residence under that roof could not fail at
some future days to shed a great credit and distinction on the name of
Brass, and add a new interest to the history of Bevis Marks.

‘For instance,’ pursued Martin, after a short reflection, ‘you’d be a
capital fellow, now, to see that my ideas were properly carried out; and
to overlook the works in their progress before they were sufficiently
advanced to be very interesting to ME; and to take all that sort of
plain sailing. Then you’d be a splendid fellow to show people over my
studio, and to talk about Art to ‘em, when I couldn’t be bored myself,
and all that kind of thing. For it would be devilish creditable, Tom
(I’m quite in earnest, I give you my word), to have a man of your
information about one, instead of some ordinary blockhead. Oh, I’d take
care of you. You’d be useful, rely upon it!’

‘For stubbornness won’t do here,’ said his sister ‘What it wants is, to
be crushed. And crushed it must be. Shall be, too!’

We should all try to discharge
              our duty.

‘I fear, father,’ hesitated Louisa, ‘that he must have made some
representation to Stephen Blackpool—perhaps in my name, perhaps in his
own—which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never
done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before
he left the town.’

There was brandy in the room.  Norah forced some drops into Mr. Frank’s
mouth, chafed his hands, and—when mere animal life returned, before the
mind poured in its flood of memories and thoughts—she lifted him up, and
rested his head against her knees.  Then she put a few crumbs of bread
taken from the supper-table, soaked in brandy into his mouth.  Suddenly
he sprang to his feet.

Richard very often came to see us while we remained in London (though
he soon failed in his letter-writing), and with his quick abilities,
his good spirits, his good temper, his gaiety and freshness, was
always delightful. But though I liked him more and more the better I
knew him, I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted
that he had been educated in no habits of application and
concentration. The system which had addressed him in exactly the same
manner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys, all varying in
character and capacity, had enabled him to dash through his tasks,
always with fair credit and often with distinction, but in a fitful,
dazzling way that had confirmed his reliance on those very qualities
in himself which it had been most desirable to direct and train. They
were good qualities, without which no high place can be meritoriously
won, but like fire and water, though excellent servants, they were
very bad masters. If they had been under Richard’s direction, they
would have been his friends; but Richard being under their direction,
they became his enemies.

‘Mr Chuzzlewit didn’t know him, I’m afraid,’ said Wolf, in reference to
a certain personage of illustrious descent, who had previously figured
in a reminiscence.

“Now, sir,” said Mr. Guppy, “I have got into that state of mind
myself that I wish for a reciprocity of magnanimous behaviour. I wish
to prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a heighth of which
perhaps she hardly thought me capable. I find that the image which I
did suppose had been eradicated from my ’eart is NOT eradicated. Its
influence over me is still tremenjous, and yielding to it, I am
willing to overlook the circumstances over which none of us have had
any control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I
had the honour to make at a former period. I beg to lay the ’ouse in
Walcot Square, the business, and myself before Miss Summerson for her
acceptance.”

GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM, _Thursday, June 4th, 1857._

‘And in the meantime,’ said Tom, ‘I must really take myself off, without
any further ceremony.’

‘No, no!’ said the hostess. ‘Not as bad as that. But I declare now that
I will not be drawn into saying another word till you have had your
supper. If you ask me fifty questions in the meantime, I won’t answer
one.’

Hunt, Leigh, ii. 407

Poor Jo! He was ugly and dirty and ignorant; but he knew one thing, that
it was wicked to tell a lie, and knowing this, he always told the truth.
One other thing poor Jo knew too well, and that was what being hungry
means. For little Jo was very poor. He lived in Tom-all-Alones, one of
the most horrible places in all London. The people who live in this
dreadful den are the poorest of London poor. All miserably clad, all
dirty, all very hungry. They know and like Jo, for he is always willing
to go on errands for them, and does them many little acts of kindness.

“Slap through the town,” whispered Sikes; “there’ll be nobody in the
way, tonight, to see us.”

The two women-servants ran up stairs to carry the intelligence that
Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in
endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be
hung. In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a
sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.

‘Well, it’s no use talking about it now,’ said Sam. ‘It’s over, and
can’t be helped, and that’s one consolation, as they always says in
Turkey, ven they cuts the wrong man’s head off. It’s my innings now,
gov’nor, and as soon as I catches hold o’ this ‘ere Trotter, I’ll have a
good ‘un.’

‘It’s in his nature, I know,’ muttered the locksmith, ‘it’s cruel to ask
him, but I must have help. Barnaby--good Barnaby--dear Barnaby--if you
know this gentleman, for the sake of his life and everybody’s life that
loves him, help me to raise him and lay him down.’

"And sweep with it all the sentiments of pity, mercy, charity,
love?"

During this short interchange of sentiments, Mr. Pickwick had, in an
abstracted mood, uncorked the bottle.

‘Blandois?’

‘Ain’t he growed!’ said Mr. Peggotty.

"There's two of you," said the man, thrusting the candle farther out,
and shading his eyes with his hand. "Who's the t'other one?"

"He is past relenting," said her husband. "He is dead."

Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust
attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was
not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought
it was no joke to the opposite party.

I wondered how he knew that.

I pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and
truth, at that time of my life; for if I should, I must be drawing near
the end, and then I would desire to remember her best! She filled my
heart with such good resolutions, strengthened my weakness so, by her
example, so directed--I know not how, she was too modest and gentle to
advise me in many words--the wandering ardor and unsettled purpose
within me, that all the little good I have done, and all the harm I have
forborne, I solemnly believe I may refer to her.

"Well," returned Mr. Peggotty, standing with his legs pretty wide apart,
and rubbing his hands up and down them in his comfortable satisfaction,
as he looked alternately at us and at the fire, "I doen't know but I am.
Not, you see, to look at."

‘Oh yes,’ I replied. ‘I know him well.’

‘I assume,’ said Arthur, persevering, in his endeavour to soften
her scornful demeanour, ‘that being in communication--may I say,
confidential communication?--with this person--’

“What cries do you mean? Chairs to mend?”

“Do I believe that this here Son and Heir’s gone down, my lads? Mayhap.
Do I say so? Which? If a skipper stands out by Sen’ George’s Channel,
making for the Downs, what’s right ahead of him? The Goodwins. He isn’t
forced to run upon the Goodwins, but he may. The bearings of this
observation lays in the application on it. That ain’t no part of my
duty. Awast then, keep a bright look-out for’ard, and good luck to
you!”

CHAPTER III
THE WHELP

With the same child’s heart within her, as of old: even with the
child’s sweet timid eyes and clustering hair: Florence, as strange to
her father in her early maiden bloom, as in her nursery time, crept
down the staircase listening as she went, and drew near to his room. No
one was stirring in the house. The door was partly open to admit air;
and all was so still within, that she could hear the burning of the
fire, and count the ticking of the clock that stood upon the
chimney-piece.

And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood.

Mr. Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest
recesses of his own heart, relative to his equestrian skill; but, as he
would not have them even suspected on any account, he at once replied
with great hardihood, "Certainly. I should enjoy it of all things."

"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.

"Are you going to Bath?" said the strange man.

Caleb managed to articulate ‘My Bertha!’

3.—The subscriptions and forfeits to be paid at the club-room on the last
Saturday night of each month.

The top of the house was worthy of notice. There was a sort of terrace
on the roof, with posts and fragments of rotten lines, once intended to
dry clothes upon; and there were two or three tea-chests out there,
full of earth, with forgotten plants in them, like old walking-sticks.
Whoever climbed to this observatory, was stunned at first from having
knocked his head against the little door in coming out; and after that,
was for the moment choked from having looked perforce, straight down the
kitchen chimney; but these two stages over, there were things to gaze
at from the top of Todgers’s, well worth your seeing too. For first
and foremost, if the day were bright, you observed upon the house-tops,
stretching far away, a long dark path; the shadow of the Monument; and
turning round, the tall original was close beside you, with every hair
erect upon his golden head, as if the doings of the city frightened him.
Then there were steeples, towers, belfries, shining vanes, and masts of
ships; a very forest. Gables, housetops, garret-windows, wilderness upon
wilderness. Smoke and noise enough for all the world at once.

[Sidenote: Mr. Eeles.]

Paris is better than ever. Oh dear, how grand it was when I came through
it in that caravan to-night! I hope we shall be very hearty here, and
able to say with Wally, "Han't it plassant!"

"Dear Davis," says Miss Maryon, while the tears fell fast down her face,
"your grateful friends, in most unwillingly taking leave of you, ask the
favour that, while you bear away with you their affectionate remembrance,
which nothing can ever impair, you will also take this purse of money--far
more valuable to you, we all know, for the deep attachment and
thankfulness with which it is offered, than for its own contents, though
we hope those may prove useful to you, too, in after life."

He had stood by the door, all this while, observant of her with a smile
upon his face, though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted. I
remarked now, that, though the smile was on his face still, his colour
had gone in a moment, and he seemed to breathe as if he had been
running.

Apart from these considerations, Martin could not endure the thought
of seeming to grasp at this unnatural charge against his relative, and
using it as a stepping-stone to his grandfather’s favour. But that he
would seem to do so, if he presented himself before his grandfather in
Mr Pecksniff’s house again, for the purpose of declaring it; and that
Mr Pecksniff, of all men, would represent his conduct in that despicable
light, he perfectly well knew. On the other hand to be in possession of
such a statement, and take no measures of further inquiry in reference
to it, was tantamount to being a partner in the guilt it professed to
disclose.

Mr Venus rubs an eyebrow, interrogatively.

‘Dear Sir--‘When I had the privillidge of being your fellow-traveller
in the cars, the day before yesterday, you offered some remarks upon the
subject of the tower of London, which (in common with my fellow-citizens
generally) I could wish to hear repeated to a public audience.

‘He is always generous and noble,’ said Mrs. Steerforth, proudly.

What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance,
and how I believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be
constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it
out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the
cities of the earth, I need not stop here to relate. We approached it by
degrees, and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district,
for which we were bound. I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or the
Blue Boar; but I know it was the Blue Something, and that its likeness
was painted up on the back of the coach.

A roar of applause that rent the air.

“In other words they’re Medical Students, I suppose?” said Mr. Pickwick.

‘He is nothing to me,’ interrupted Miss Squeers, with hysterical
symptoms. ‘I despise him too much!’

When he rejoined Little Dorrit, and they had begun walking as before,
she said all at once:

This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the
other end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he
coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound,
and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute,
appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.

"A friend is coming," said the bard; "but he wears the face of a foe.
Nor does he come alone; but prepared to demand what was forbidden;--to
take what was withheld. Niall, with a host of warriors, is at thy gate.
Thy bands that watch thy foe have left thy friend free to approach
thee; but he comes in the form of the avenger."

“Don’t you be afraid of hurting the boy,” he says. “You won’t do
that. It’s all right as far as the boy’s concerned. We shall only
bring him here to ask him a question or so I want to put to him, and
he’ll be paid for his trouble and sent away again. It’ll be a good
job for him. I promise you, as a man, that you shall see the boy sent
away all right. Don’t you be afraid of hurting him; you an’t going to
do that.”

'Twas midnight; but still Biddy sat within her chair, and rocked, and
rocked, and looking at the fire, as cinder after cinder blackened in
the grate, she muttered, and spoke as to herself, "They're none of
my getting,--none of my flesh! Didn't I feed, clothe her?--she ran
away from my roof, and let her want. A night like this will break her
spirit, and teach her what it is to be without one--'twill----" She
paused suddenly, and bent her ear as in the act of listening; her
grey eyes gazed round the room as she said, "It sounded like a door
creaking, or a bolt;" and again she listened. The candle burnt dimly on
the table, and the embers grew darker and darker as Biddy spread her
hands to catch their warmth, and muttered, "At night, one is full of
fancies; it's only the wind;" and, communing with herself, she added,
"I've paid them back their own, and given them lies for lies, and they
hate me for it: but they fear me, too,--that's one comfort,--for they
know I'm rich. Rich--ha! ha! there's a sly cupboard there," and she
pointed to a recess in the wall, where a concealed door stood half
ajar; "there's a nest holds more eggs than they think for; and if I had
liked--but the boy is none of mine--the boy--" A draught of air as from
an opened door made her look round. She sat frozen to her chair as the
figure of a man darkened in the room; a second, masked like his fellow,
stood in the shadow of the door; and Biddy, with a fixed stare, looked
like a corpse, blue-lipped and hollow-eyed. Her chair shook under her,
and her voice came not, though her mouth opened, and her throat worked
as if to scream! The man moved a step; it was electric! Biddy started
to her feet, and with a hollow voice cried "Murder!" The ruffian with
a curse darted at her throat, and, in a hissing whisper between his
teeth, cried, "Quiet, you hag, or I'll settle you!" Biddy, old and
feeble as she was, fastened with both hands upon his, and struggled
in his grip. The mask fell from his face, and with starting eyes
she looked at what seemed to scorch them, uttered a choking scream,
and--Let us draw the curtain.

We went to the far North once more,
To seek the well-remembered home,
Where my poor kinsman dwelt before,
Whence now he was too old to roam;
And there six happy years we past,
Happy and peaceful till the last;
When poor old Walter died, and he
Blessed me and said I now might be
A sailor on the deep blue sea.
And so I go; and yet in spite
Of all the joys I long to know,
Though I look onward with delight,
With something of regret I go;
And young or old, on land or sea,
One guiding memory I shall take--
Of what She prayed that I might be,
And what I will be for her sake!

Beginning to be struck by Defarge’s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being
The Vengeance.

“Now,” Mr. Crisparkle again resumed, in a tone of mild though firm
persuasion, “is not this to be regretted, and ought it not to be
amended? These are early days of Neville’s in Cloisterham, and I have
no fear of his outliving such a prejudice, and proving himself to have
been misunderstood. But how much wiser to take action at once, than to
trust to uncertain time! Besides, apart from its being politic, it is
right. For there can be no question that Neville was wrong.”

‘Oh, I dare say!’ rejoined Merry, looking back. ‘You’re very anxious I
should stay, fright, ain’t you?’

“I cannot tell, Mr. Wilcox,” said that gentleman, taking the order into
his hands, and regarding it with an air of extreme perplexity.  “I could
have sworn it was mine, had it been attached to any other document.  I
think Forbes’s handwriting is not so well imitated.  But it is the very
ink I use, and mine is a peculiar signature.”

"Woo!" said Mr. Gamfield, to the donkey.

So, with another sharp look round the room, he went out at the door;
followed by Caleb with the wedding-cake on his head.

MY DEAR MAMEY AND KATEY,

Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
generous fire; secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The
cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime on
his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin.

‘“Isn’t there a ‘Mister’ before it?” said my uncle. For he felt,
gentlemen, that for a guard he didn’t know, to call him Jack Martin, was
a liberty which the Post Office wouldn’t have sanctioned if they had
known it.

Stephen looked at him with some little irresolution for a moment, and
then seemed to make up his mind.

‘You have,’ replied Rose. ‘My true and faithful pledge.’

‘That was our light porter at the Bank,’ said Tom, ‘who brought you the
message to-night.  I call him our light porter, because I belong to the
Bank too.’

‘Oh! both Fanny and I said, at once, that she was regularly cut out for
you.’

Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the
cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within, so she coughed and
listened again. Still there was no reply, so she spoke.

"We were there quite by accident," returned Nell; "we are poor people,
ma'am, and are only wandering about.  We have nothing to do; I wish we
had."

“Mama!” said Florence.

‘The hollow down by the flare?’

‘Then, tell me again about him, dear father,’ said Bertha.  ‘Many times
again!  His face is benevolent, kind, and tender.  Honest and true, I am
sure it is.  The manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a show
of roughness and unwillingness, beats in its every look and glance.’

Here is my aunt, in stronger spectacles, an old woman of four-score
years and more, but upright yet, and a steady walker of six miles at a
stretch in winter weather.

On the 15th of the next month, his first benefit for that season took
place at Sadler's Wells. He sustained the part of Don Juan; and his
son, J. S. Grimaldi, played Scaramouch, being his second appearance.
He acted the part capitally, and had a great reception, so that his
father now in good earnest began to hope he would not only support the
name of Grimaldi, but confer upon it increased popularity. The receipts
of this night were 231_l._ 14_s._ Three months afterwards his second
benefit occurred: Monday, the 9th of October, was the day fixed for
it, but on the preceding Saturday he was suddenly seized with severe
illness, originating in a most distressing impediment in his breathing.
Medical assistance was immediately called in, and he was bled until
nigh fainting. This slightly relieved him; but shortly afterwards he
had a relapse, and four weeks passed before he recovered sufficiently
to leave the house. There is no doubt but that some radical change
had occurred in his constitution, for previously to this attack he
had never been visited with a single day's illness, while after its
occurrence he never had a single day of perfect health.

_James._ We were going, sir, to hear the Christmas Carols, but mindful
of the obligation resting upon us, which falls due to-morrow, and of our
inability to meet the payment, we have called to beg your indulgence,
and ask for a further extension of time.

"The servant," pursued Ham, "was seen along with--our poor girl--last
night. He's been in hiding about here, this week or over. He was thought
to have gone, but he was hiding. Doen't stay, Mas'r Davy, doen't!"

‘_My_ mother?  Bolted, ma’am!’ said Bounderby.

"The Devil take you!" said Uriah, writhing in a new way with pain. "I'll
be even with you."

‘Why,’ replied the youth, drawing closer to his questioner’s side, ‘I
was with him at night, and when it was all silent he cried no more for
friends he wished to come and sit with him, but began to see faces round
his bed that came from home; he said they smiled, and talked to him; and
he died at last lifting his head to kiss them. Do you hear?’

‘A select company of the Bath footmen presents their compliments to Mr.
Weller, and requests the pleasure of his company this evening, to a
friendly swarry, consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual
trimmings. The swarry to be on table at half-past nine o’clock
punctually.’

‘I have a good many people in my custody.’ He glanced downward, as
he spoke, into the jail: and the feeling that he could see into the
different yards, and that he overlooked everything which was hidden from
their view by the rugged walls, so lashed and goaded the mob, that they
howled like wolves.

Mrs. Squeers had listened to this conversation, from the bottom of
the stairs; but, now losing all patience, she hastily assumed her
night-jacket, and made her way to the scene of action.

"I have been minute, my lord, in these particulars, that you may the
better understand what has yet to come, for it was about this time
that I made my engagement to serve Calonne; and I was not long in
ascertaining that, though apparently the superficial prodigal, and
the frivolous man of fashion, there was yet an energetic boldness
about him that would, if thwarted in his views, urge him to some deed
of desperation. In most instances he behaved to me with the utmost
familiarity; but I strongly suspected that, through some secret agency
of which I was held in ignorance, he kept up a communication with the
disaffected amongst the middle orders; nor was it long before the
fact was fully revealed to me, for the individual who had been the
accustomed means of correspondence was seized with sudden illness, and
negociations were for a time suspended. It was an anxious and trying
period for the minister; he stood upon a pinnacle from which a powerful
party were concentrating all their force to hurl him, whilst the
illness of the agent had separated him from those who, proud in their
republicanism, would not of themselves seek him, and yet it was from
them alone that he now anticipated succour.

No. 1 gifted also with _a_, _b_, _c_, would be brave sometimes, and
sometimes not; if No. 2, however, were equally _a_, _b_, _c_, then the
disadvantageous side of such a disposition would come into action, and
No. 2 would in this case be a regular portion, not so much _because_ he
_must_ be such, like No. 3, but because it would be far more convenient,
and more suitable to his nature: such would be many men in the lower,
and the whole dear sex in the highest, degree. The undeniably cowardly
disposition of the Jews has the same foundation. We have so long denied
them human and social rights, that the motives of vanity and the sense
of honour can operate but feebly on them, while that of duty in relation
to us can scarcely exist at all. Nothing but centuries of a more
reasonable and humane policy can render this otherwise.

And Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises,
and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to
undertake the commission. She was not, indeed, withheld by the same
considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed
into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel
suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of
being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.

‘John Edward Nandy. Sir. While there’s a ounce of wittles or drink of
any sort in this present roof, you’re fully welcome to your share on
it. While there’s a handful of fire or a mouthful of bed in this present
roof, you’re fully welcome to your share on it. If so be as there should
be nothing in this present roof, you should be as welcome to your share
on it as if it was something, much or little. And this is what I mean
and so I don’t deceive you, and consequently which is to stand out is to
entreat of you, and therefore why not do it?’

It being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby’s return, we
called again. She was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile
End directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising
out of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I
had not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call (when he was not
to be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have
strolled away with the dustman’s cart), I now inquired for him again.
The oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the
passage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that
he had “gone after the sheep.” When we repeated, with some surprise,
“The sheep?” she said, Oh, yes, on market days he sometimes followed
them quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was!

‘Oh!’ said Mr Pecksniff, ‘Here is the young man. HE will take the
card. With my compliments, if you please, young man. My dears, we are
interrupting the studies. Let us go.’

‘Are you going?’ demanded the boy, in an earnest whisper.

The greeting between Mr. Pickwick and his professional adviser was
warm and cordial; the client was scarcely ensconced in the attorney's
arm-chair, however, when a knock was heard at the door, and a voice
inquired whether Mr. Perker was within.

OFFICE OF "ALL THE YEAR ROUND,"
                                            _Monday, April 1st, 1867._

Mr. Bumble lifted off his cocked hat, took a handkerchief from the
inside of the crown, wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his
rage had engendered, fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the
undertaker, said in a calmer voice,

Master Micawber's moroseness of aspect returned upon him again, and he
demanded, with some temper, what he was to do? Whether he had been born
a carpenter, or a coach painter, any more than he had been born a bird?
Whether he could go into the next street, and open a chemist's shop?
Whether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim himself a
lawyer? Whether he could come out by force at the opera, and succeed by
violence? Whether he could do anything, without being brought up to
something?

I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I
loved Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love him,—and, as to him, my inner self
was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when
I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe
the whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted
that if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing
Joe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at
night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up
my tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I
never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair
whisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe
knew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at
yesterday’s meat or pudding when it came on to-day’s table, without
thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,
if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life
remarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he
suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,
I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too
cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no
intercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its
many inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, I
made the discovery of the line of action for myself.

I am writing a little history of England for my boy, which I will send
you when it is printed for him, though your boys are too old to profit
by it. It is curious that I have tried to impress upon him (writing, I
daresay, at the same moment with you) the exact spirit of your paper,
for I don't know what I should do if he were to get hold of any
Conservative or High Church notions; and the best way of guarding
against any such horrible result is, I take it, to wring the parrots'
necks in his very cradle.

I went up to him, after a moment of confusion, and said, "I beg your
pardon, sir. I am very sorry for what I did, and I hope you will forgive
me."

The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate
guard. I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of the
torches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to
see it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good
path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and
there where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy
sluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming
in after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon
the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I
could see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air
about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather
to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We
could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,
that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.

‘If the spirits of the illustrious dead participate in the concerns and
cares of those who are dear to them in this transitory life, O ever dear
and venerable shade of my departed father, look down with scrutiny upon
the conduct of your suffering son, and see if I have even for a moment
deviated from those principles of morality and patriotism which it was
your care to instil into my youthful mind, and for which I am now about
to offer up my life.

Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to say on
the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad end; and
then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it.

The Secretary rose, gathered up his papers, and withdrew. Bella’s eyes
followed him to the door, lighted on Mr Boffin complacently thrown back
in his easy chair, and drooped over her book.

"Shall I tell you a secret, Bertha?"

‘As the old gentleman solemnly uttered these words, his features grew
less and less distinct, and his figure more shadowy. A film came over
Tom Smart’s eyes. The old man seemed gradually blending into the chair,
the damask waistcoat to resolve into a cushion, the red slippers to
shrink into little red cloth bags. The light faded gently away, and Tom
Smart fell back on his pillow, and dropped asleep.

"A thousand," replied the stranger. "Pray go on."

"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past."

No, thank you, Sir.’

“But we must consider Allan. He must not think that his success makes us
sad.”

It was yet early in the morning of the following day, when, as I was
walking in my garden with my aunt (who took little other exercise now,
being so much in attendance on my dear Dora), I was told that Mr.
Peggotty desired to speak with me. He came into the garden to meet me
half-way, on my going towards the gate; and bared his head, as it was
always his custom to do when he saw my aunt, for whom he had a high
respect. I had been telling her all that had happened over-night.
Without saying a word, she walked up with a cordial face, shook hands
with him, and patted him on the arm. It was so expressively done, that
she had no need to say a word. Mr. Peggotty understood her quite as well
as if she had said a thousand.

"Water them now," said Mr. Tupman in accents of persuasion.

She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her
how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in
this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)
involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they
were the weighty secrets of another.

‘If you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the
trench, take the foot-path to the left when you arrive at an angle of
the fortification, and keep straight on, till you see me, I will precede
you to a secluded place, where the affair can be conducted without fear
of interruption.’

_Squire._ Yours alone is Lucy's heart,
            I swear it, by that Heav'n above me.

Of all the craft that ever swam upon salt-water give me the dashing
forty-four gun frigate, with a ship's company of dare-devils who would
board his Satanic Majesty's kitchen in the midst of cooking-time, if
they could only get a gallant spirit to lead them. And pray, what would
a ship's company be without leaders? for, after all, it is the officers
that make the men what they are; so that, when I see a well-rigged
man-o'-war, in which discipline is preserved without unnecessary
punishment or toil, that's the hooker for me; and such was his Britannic
Majesty's frigate, "the saucy, thrash-'em-all SPANKAWAY," for by that
title was she known from Yarmouth Roads to the Land's End. Oh, she was a
lovely creature! almost a thing of life! and it would be outraging the
principles of beauty to give her any other than a female designation.
Everybody has been in love some time or other in the course of his
existence, and the object of affection was no doubt an angel in the eyes
of the ardent lover:--just so was the frigate to me--an angel; for she
had wings, and her movements were regulated by the breath of heaven.
She was the very standard of loveliness, the most exquisite of graceful
forms. At anchor she sat upon the water with all the elegance and ease
of the cygnet, or like a queen reclining on her downy couch. Under weigh
she resembled the pretty pintado bird skimming the billow tops, or the
fleet dolphin darting from wave to wave. Then to see her climb the
rolling swell, or cleave the rising foam, baptising her children with
the spray, and naming them her seamen--Oh, it was a spectacle worth a
life to witness!

‘Quite soon enough for you. I shall not disappoint you; don’t be
afraid.’

Between her indignation and the teapot, her powers of comprehending what
was said to her began to fail. She looked at John with tearful eyes, and
murmuring the well-remembered name which Mrs Prig had challenged--as if
it were a talisman against all earthly sorrows--seemed to wander in her
mind.

Within a day or two, she gained her husband over, and prevailed on the
tall idiot to abandon the conspirators and fly with her to Dunbar.
There, he issued a proclamation, audaciously and falsely denying that
he had any knowledge of the late bloody business; and there they were
joined by the Earl Bothwell and some other nobles. With their help,
they raised eight thousand men; returned to Edinburgh, and drove the
assassins into England. Mary soon afterwards gave birth to a son—still
thinking of revenge.

“Just so, just so,” the old man nods.

“I believe so, your ladyship.”

--The benches were by the wall, but there were none to sit there;
the tables were spread in what had been the hall, but it seemed as
if none had gathered round them for many years;--the clock struck
audibly, there was no voice of mirth or of occupation to drown its
sound; time told his awful lesson to silence alone;--the hearths
were black with fuel long since consumed;--the family portraits
looked as if they were the only tenants of the mansion; they seemed
to say, from their moldering frames, "there are none to gaze on
us;" and the echo of the steps of Stanton and his feeble guide, was
the only sound audible between the peals of thunder that rolled
still awfully, but more distantly,--every peal like the exhausted
murmurs of a spent heart.  As they passed on, a shriek was heard.
Stanton paused, and fearful images of the dangers to which
travelers on the Continent are exposed in deserted and remote
habitations, came into his mind.  "Don't heed it," said the old
woman, lighting him on with a miserable lamp;--"it is only he. . . .

‘That’s her malevolence--that’s her malevolence,’ returned Mr. Bob
Sawyer vehemently. ‘She says that if I can afford to give a party I
ought to be able to pay her confounded “little bill.”’

"Clara Peggotty, again?" I suggested.

‘Heigho!’ sighed Nicholas, as he threw himself back in the prompter’s
chair, after telegraphing the needful directions to Smike, who had been
playing a meagre tailor in the interlude, with one skirt to his coat,
and a little pocket-handkerchief with a large hole in it, and a woollen
nightcap, and a red nose, and other distinctive marks peculiar to
tailors on the stage. ‘Heigho! I wish all this were over.’

‘If there’s law in England, sir,’ said Dodson, looking towards Mr.
Pickwick, as he put on his hat, ‘you shall smart for this.’

This lady, Mrs. Jarley by name, had seen Nell and her grandfather at the
races, so hailed them and asked about the success of the Punch show.
She was greatly astonished to learn that they had nothing to do with it,
and were wandering about without any object in view.

Ever affectionately yours.

But no such day had ever dawned on Mr Dombey, or his wife; and the
course of each was taken.

“I say!” said the man, with tipsy gravity; “that won’t do, you know.”

The whole establishment turned out to look at the little girl.  Nobody
knew her; nobody could make out her name, as she set it forth—except one
chambermaid, who said it was Constantinople—which it wasn’t.

Half-a-dozen words on this, my birthday, to thank you for your kind and
welcome remembrance, and to assure you that your Joseph is proud of it.

The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening
to a complaint of the heart, announced the train.  Fire and steam, and
smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put
into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station a
desert speck in the thunderstorm.

‘I cannot say,’ replied Nicholas. ‘I was speaking more to my own
thoughts, than to you.’

"Is he coming up from Oxford?"

Wir gruben in stummer Nacht ihn ein
      Mit Bayonetten in Erd' und in Trümmer,
    Bey des trüben Mondlichts schwankendem Schein
      Und der matten Lanterne Geflimmer.

"And got out again?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, hastily.

“That then, Captain Gills, is the party you spoke of, when you said
that he and Miss Dombey were made for one another?”

“Mr. Jasper was that, Tope?”

Even when they began to clear it was no better; for then a stream of
gentlemen, every one with a lady on each arm (exactly like the chorus
to the National Anthem when Royalty goes in state to the play), came
gliding in--every new group fresher than the last, and bent on staying
to the latest moment. If they spoke to him, which was not often, they
invariably asked the same questions, in the same tone; with no more
remorse, or delicacy, or consideration, than if he had been a figure of
stone, purchased, and paid for, and set up there for their delight. Even
when, in the slow course of time, these died off, it was as bad as ever,
if not worse; for then the boys grew bold, and came in as a class
of themselves, and did everything that the grown-up people had done.
Uncouth stragglers, too, appeared; men of a ghostly kind, who being in,
didn’t know how to get out again; insomuch that one silent gentleman
with glazed and fishy eyes and only one button on his waistcoat (which
was a very large metal one, and shone prodigiously), got behind the
door, and stood there, like a clock, long after everybody else was gone.

"I ask your pardon, sir," says Cobbs. "What was it you--"

‘Mark me,’ said Mr Haredale, striding to the table, and laying his hand
upon it heavily. ‘If any man believes--presumes to think--that I, in
word or deed, or in the wildest dream, ever entertained remotely the
idea of Emma Haredale’s favouring the suit of any one who was akin to
you--in any way--I care not what--he lies. He lies, and does me grievous
wrong, in the mere thought.’

All at once she stopped.

‘A charming woman indeed, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip; ‘as amiable, I am sure,
as it was possible to be! Mrs. Chillip’s opinion is, that her spirit
has been entirely broken since her marriage, and that she is all but
melancholy mad. And the ladies,’ observed Mr. Chillip, timorously, ‘are
great observers, sir.’

“Who?” cried Mr Dombey. “What does she mean? What is this?”

‘Dear me!’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘Poor lady! Gently Sam, gently.’

COACHMAN.  (In a very surly tone.)  No it an’t.

This being something in the nature of a poser for Podsnap, he merely
waves it away with a speechless wave.

Nobody having the hardihood to object to his doing so, he does it,
and the party retire as they came up. Mr. Bucket follows them to the
door, and returning, says with an air of serious business, “Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it’s for you to consider whether or not
to buy this up. I should recommend, on the whole, it’s being bought
up myself; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap. You see, that
little pickled cowcumber of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides
of the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and
ends together than if she had meant it. Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, he
held all these horses in his hand and could have drove ’em his own
way, I haven’t a doubt; but he was fetched off the box head-foremost,
and now they have got their legs over the traces, and are all
dragging and pulling their own ways. So it is, and such is life. The
cat’s away, and the mice they play; the frost breaks up, and the
water runs. Now, with regard to the party to be apprehended.”

"Hullo, my covey, what's the row?" said this strange young gentleman to
Oliver.

‘And about--’

"Take the letter! Take the letter!"

"Somebody who is very kind to me, sir."

“Look here!” said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and
halfpence. “Here’s a jolly life! What’s the odds where it comes from?
Here, catch hold; there’s plenty more where they were took from. You
won’t, won’t you? Oh, you precious flat!”

Mr Carker the Manager pushed him backward into a corner—the boy
submitting quietly, hardly venturing to breathe, and never once
removing his eyes from his face—and rang the bell.

There were here some remarks not very inappropriate, considering
that they were written when the Duke of Newcastle was fighting on his
stumps, and the ferment concerning Admiral Byng was at its height.

“Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed Carton.

“And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. “No games to-morrow! If I, as a
honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don’t. _I_’m your Rome, you know.”

"T. Copperfield, Esquire," said the ticket-porter, touching his hat with
his little cane.

‘Now, ma’am,’ said Ralph, who had looked on, at all this, with such
scorn as few men can express in looks, ‘this is my niece.’

“Oh!” said Old Cheeseman.  “But it’s solitary here in the holiday time.
He had better come to us.”

ANONYMOUS

A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which
she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.

He didn’t say this. He only thought it--perhaps looked it also. Dolly
was glad to see him, and was SO sorry her father and mother were away
from home. Joe begged she wouldn’t mention it on any account.

‘Elizabeth, or Eliza, Miss Peecher.’

‘Not forgetting to remember the servants,’ said the chambermaid in a
bland whisper.

(_To the Ghost._)

‘Quite perfect,’ rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder.
‘You’re a genius, my dear.’

“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll tell
me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid
of the whole subject.”

He nodded, as she seemed to expect an answer in the affirmative.

Bradley Headstone held fast by that other interview he was to have with
Lizzie Hexam. In stipulating for it, he had been impelled by a feeling
little short of desperation, and the feeling abided by him. It was very
soon after his interview with the Secretary, that he and Charley Hexam
set out one leaden evening, not unnoticed by Miss Peecher, to have this
desperate interview accomplished.

"There is somebody listening in there!" he exclaimed, with a sharp
backward glance at Bintrey.

“Now, George,” says Mr. Bucket, “don’t you go and commit yourself.
I’m a-going to tell you what I want you for. There has been a murder
in Lincoln’s Inn Fields—gentleman of the name of Tulkinghorn. He was
shot last night. I want you for that.”

‘Ah! I see ‘em,’ said Mrs Gamp; ‘all the whole kit of ‘em numbered like
hackney-coaches, an’t they?’

‘Fast as a top,’ said Mr Cobb.

“It is an echo,” said the Phantom.

[Illustration: "TO WHICH! SAY THAT AGAIN," CRIED MR. SMALLWEED, IN A
SHRILL, SHARP VOICE--Chap. lxii.]

‘I thought you knowed the man I mean, learned governor. I want the man.’

The two boys (for though Will was nearly twenty-one, she still thought
of him as a lad) had done everything in their power to make the
house-place comfortable for her. She herself, in the old days before her
sorrow, had never made a brighter fire or a cleaner hearth, ready for
her husband’s return home, than now awaited her. The tea-things were all
put out, and the kettle was boiling; and the boys had calmed their grief
down into a kind of sober cheerfulness. They paid her every attention
they could think of, but received little notice on her part; she did not
resist--she rather submitted to all their arrangements; but they did
not seem to touch her heart.

‘I should as soon have thought of a man’s wearing the case of an
eight-day clock to save his linen,’ said Twigger, casting a look of
apprehension at the brass suit.

"You are welcome to the Marshalsea, sir. I have welcomed many gentlemen
to these walls.  Perhaps you are aware--my daughter Amy may have
mentioned--that I am the Father of this place."

‘My dear Lizzie,’ he returned, in a low voice, bending over her on the
other side; ‘of what? Of whom?’

Martin called to him immediately to be of their party; so Cicero and the
truck went one way, and they three went another.

‘Hark!’ cried the young lady, listening. ‘Did she call! I thought I
heard her voice.’

‘Deep enough,’ retorted Ralph, ‘to know that I shall need all the depth
I have, when men like you begin to compliment. You know I have stood by
when you fawned and flattered other people, and I remember pretty well
what THAT always led to.’

‘The story about what?’ said Mr. Pickwick.

It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry
said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again.

“And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,” muttered Nancy:
brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.

‘Oh Harry, Harry,’ said the young lady, bursting into tears; ‘I wish
I could, and spare myself this pain.’

“Mrs Pipchin,” said Mr Dombey, “How do you do?”

“No,” he replied. “Such an unworldly, uncalculating, gossamer
creature is a relief to him and an amusement. But as to advising or
encouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or
anything, it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as
Skimpole.”

"Wery much obliged for your good opinion, sir," replied Sam. "We shall
get on by degrees, I des-say. We'll try a better one, by-and-by."

CHAPTER XVI -- RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD
BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY

Lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the cause of Miss
Miggs’s deep emotion, it may be whispered apart that, happening to
be listening, as her custom sometimes was, when Gabriel and his wife
conversed together, she had heard the locksmith’s joke relative to the
foreign black who played the tambourine, and bursting with the spiteful
feelings which the taunt awoke in her fair breast, exploded in the
manner we have witnessed. Matters having now arrived at a crisis, the
locksmith, as usual, and for the sake of peace and quietness, gave in.

It was only when the boy rushed at her, and threw his arms round her
neck, that she lost her self-restraint. But she lost it then, and wept
over him.

‘Lady and gentleman?’ inquired Wardle, almost breathless with
impatience.

Ever most affectionately, my dearest Macready.

The name of this clerk was Bob Cratchet. He had a wife and five other
children beside Tim, who was a weak and delicate little cripple, gentle
and patient and loving, with a sweet face of his own, which no one could
help looking at.

Mr. Squeers then nudged Mrs. Squeers to bring away the brandy bottle, lest
Nicholas should help himself in the night; and the lady having seized it
with great precipitation, they retired together.

Oliver was precisely in the condition I have described. He saw the Jew
with his half-closed eyes, heard his low whistling, and recognised the
sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan's sides; and yet the
self-same senses were mentally engaged at the same time, in busy action
with almost everybody he had ever known.

“Why not?”

‘I can,’ said Fagin, almost aloud. ‘She durst not refuse me then.
Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are
ready, and shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!’

‘It’s very gratifying, isn’t it?’ said Mr. Ben Allen, holding his plate
for some more minced veal.

(‘Then,’ thinks Twemlow, with his eyes shut, ‘there are si—’ But here
collapses and does not completely recover until dinner is over and the
Analytical has been requested to withdraw.)

Poor dear Jeffrey! I had heard from him but a few days, and the unopened
proof of No. 10 was lying on his table when he died. I believe I have
lost as affectionate a friend as I ever had, or ever shall have, in this
world.

The negro church which stood in the pine woods near the little village
of Oxford Cross Roads, in one of the lower counties of Virginia, was
presided over by an elderly individual, known to the community in
general as Uncle Pete; but on Sundays the members of his congregation
addressed him as Brudder Pete. He was an earnest and energetic man,
and, although he could neither read nor write, he had for many years
expounded the Scriptures to the satisfaction of his hearers. His
memory was good, and those portions of the Bible, which from time to
time he had heard read, were used by him, and frequently with powerful
effect, in his sermons. His interpretations of the Scriptures were
generally entirely original, and were made to suit the needs, or what
he supposed to be the needs, of his congregation.

In another room, a kind of purgatory or place of transition, six or eight
noisy madwomen were gathered together, under the superintendence of one
sane attendant.  Among them was a girl of two or three and twenty, very
prettily dressed, of most respectable appearance and good manners, who
had been brought in from the house where she had lived as domestic
servant (having, I suppose, no friends), on account of being subject to
epileptic fits, and requiring to be removed under the influence of a very
bad one.  She was by no means of the same stuff, or the same breeding, or
the same experience, or in the same state of mind, as those by whom she
was surrounded; and she pathetically complained that the daily
association and the nightly noise made her worse, and was driving her
mad—which was perfectly evident.  The case was noted for inquiry and
redress, but she said she had already been there for some weeks.

BOULOGNE, _Wednesday, July 27th, 1853._

‘Are you so determined, Lizzie—forgive the word I am going to use, for
its literal truth—to fly from a lover?’

When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and Mrs. Joe dressed,
and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked (it never was at
any other time) for the company to enter by, and everything most
splendid.  And still, not a word of the robbery.

And now the stone was lowered down into its place, amidst the shouting
of the concourse. When it was firmly fixed, the member for the
Gentlemanly Interest struck upon it thrice with the handle of the
trowel, as if inquiring, with a touch of humour, whether anybody was at
home. Mr Pecksniff then unrolled his Plans (prodigious plans they were),
and people gathered round to look at and admire them.

I wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then.
Unless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.

‘A military officer,’ said Mark.

Miss Dartle put her hand upon her side. I saw him steal a glance at her,
and slightly smile to himself.

"When I wos first pitched neck and crop into the world, to play at
leap-frog with its troubles," replied Sam. "I wos a carrier's boy at
startin': then a vagginer's, then a helper, then a boots. Now I'm a
gen'l'm'n's servant. I shall be a gen'l'm'n myself one of these days,
perhaps, with a pipe in my mouth, and a summer-house in the back
garden. Who knows? _I_ shouldn't be surprised, for one."

Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the fat boy
and Mr. Weller, having shovelled and swept away the snow which had
fallen on it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skaits with a
dexterity which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and described
circles with his left leg, and cut figures of eight; and inscribed upon
the ice, without once stopping for breath, a great many other pleasant
and astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick,
Mr. Tupman, and the ladies; which reached a pitch of positive
enthusiasm, when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the
aforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some mystic evolutions, which they
called a reel.

“Then you’re wrong, Jack.”

[Illustration]

‘Ye--ye--yes,’ sobbed the little boy, rubbing his face very hard with
the Beggar’s Petition in printed calico.

“And was it there, my dear—” I began.

Truce, however, to prefacing. We well know that speechmaking never yet
won an election, because something more tangible than speechifying
is requisite. So it is with books; and, indeed, so is it with every
thing else in the world. We must be judged by our works. We have only
one petition to make, which is put in with all due humility,--it is
this--that we are not to be pre-judged by this our first attempt.
Nothing is more probable than that many of our readers, and they
fair-going people too, will think this number a matter not at all to be
commended; and we, with perfect modesty, suggest, on the other side, the
propriety of their suspending their opinion as to our demerits until
they see the next. And then----And then! Well!--what then? Why, we do
not know: and, as it is generally ruled, that, when a man cannot speak,
he is bound to sing, we knock ourselves down for a song.

It was quite unnecessary to call Samuel Weller; for Samuel Weller
stepped briskly into the box the instant his name was pronounced; and
placing his hat on the floor, and his arms on the rail, took a bird’s-
eye view of the Bar, and a comprehensive survey of the Bench, with a
remarkably cheerful and lively aspect.

the homely consequences resulting from the fairy quarrel,

There was one guest, however, albeit not resident within the house, who
had been very constant in his attentions to the family, and who still
remained devoted to them. This was Mr Toots, who after renewing, some
weeks ago, the acquaintance he had had the happiness of forming with
Skettles Junior, on the night when he burst the Blimberian bonds and
soared into freedom with his ring on, called regularly every other day,
and left a perfect pack of cards at the hall-door; so many indeed, that
the ceremony was quite a deal on the part of Mr Toots, and a hand at
whist on the part of the servant.

_Showing how Mr. Samuel Weller got into Difficulties_

He looked so very much astonished, that Bella could not make up her mind
to break it to him just yet.

_Queershanks._--Not engage me in that shape! My shape is
unexceptionable. Only look at this muscle. Here's muscle for Hercules,
sir! Feel it, sir; will you be so good?

“Ah!” said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but
grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand:
and placing it in front of his chest; “I have seen a good many pieces
of business like this, in my time, ladies.”

"That's the Till!" observed Miss Mowcher, standing at the chair again,
and replacing in the bag the miscellaneous collection of little objects
she had emptied out of it. "Have I got all my traps? It seems so. It
won't do to be like long Ned Beadwood, when they took him to church 'to
marry him to somebody,' as he says, and left the bride behind. Ha! ha!
ha! A wicked rascal, Ned, but droll! Now, I know I'm going to break your
hearts, but I am forced to leave you. You must call up all your
fortitude, and try to bear it. Good bye, Mr. Copperfield! Take care of
yourself, Jockey of Norfolk! How I _have_ been rattling on! It's all the
fault of you two wretches. _I_ forgive you! 'Bob swore!'--as the
Englishman said for 'Good night,' when he first learnt French, and
thought it so like English. 'Bob swore,' my ducks!"

Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard,
sat down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off
the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they
sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him,
with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the
emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily
drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.

Mrs. Joram tossed her head, endeavouring to be very stern and cross; but
she could not command her softer self, and began to cry. I was young, to
be sure; but I thought much the better of her for this sympathy, and
fancied it became her, as a virtuous wife and mother, very well indeed.

To the spirits' far land in the mansions above,
      Unsullied, thus early her soul wing'd its flight;
    While she bask'd in the beams of affection and love,
      And knew not the clouds that oft shadow their light!

Here is the last judge come at last, and now he takes his place at the
horse-shoe table.

There was no need to finish the sentence, for they had rushed out of the
house, and were far beyond hearing. He stopped in the middle of a laugh,
listened, drew on his gloves, and, clasping his hands behind him, paced
the deserted room for a long time, then bent his steps towards the busy
town, and walked into the streets.

At the first sound of their voices outside the house, Nicholas, who had
passed a sleepless night, devising schemes for the recovery of his lost
charge, started from his bed, and joyfully admitted them. There was so
much noisy conversation, and congratulation, and indignation, that the
remainder of the family were soon awakened, and Smike received a warm
and cordial welcome, not only from Kate, but from Mrs. Nickleby also, who
assured him of her future favour and regard, and was so obliging as to
relate, for his entertainment and that of the assembled circle, a most
remarkable account extracted from some work the name of which she had
never known, of a miraculous escape from some prison, but what one she
couldn’t remember, effected by an officer whose name she had forgotten,
confined for some crime which she didn’t clearly recollect.

“Or,” continued Mrs. Fleming, “if you like to let Allan and his bed and
curtain come down to our place, you will have plenty of room here; much
more than my neighbors have, for the most part. How it will be when the
new cottages are built, I don’t know. We think them too small for new
houses; but, meantime, there are the Brookes sleeping seven in a room no
bigger than this, and the Vines six in one much smaller.”

“Full dressed.  Together with a house, and all things necessary for
housekeeping—”

"Don't know--never saw her in all my life--cut out the Doctor--here
goes." And the stranger forthwith crossed the room; and, leaning
against a mantelpiece, commenced gazing with an air of respectful and
melancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady.
Mr. Tupman looked on, in mute astonishment. The stranger progressed
rapidly; the little Doctor danced with another lady; the widow dropped
her fan, the stranger picked it up, and presented it,--a smile--a
bow--a curtsey--a few words of conversation. The stranger walked
boldly up to, and returned with, the master of ceremonies; a little
introductory pantomime; and the stranger and Mrs. Budger took their
places in a quadrille.

To this letter, I received an answer by return of post. As I read it, I
seemed to hear Agnes speaking to me. It was like her cordial voice in my
ears. What can I say more!

He planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose so
firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to
open it from the inside, and creeping over the tiles, looked over the
low parapet.

"I hope not."

“Well, it is a wonder, ain’t it now, Miss Floy?” said Susan; “but I
wish you had a many visitors, I do, indeed, for you’d be all the better
for it, and it’s my opinion that the sooner you and me goes even to
them old Skettleses, Miss, the better for both, I may not wish to live
in crowds, Miss Floy, but still I’m not a oyster.”

I am clear that a number by "various writers" would not do. If we have
not the usual sort of number, we must call the current number for that
date the Christmas number, and make it as good as possible.

"I say! A word with you," murmured Tackleton, nudging the Carrier with
his elbow, and taking him a little apart. "You'll come to the wedding?
We're in the same boat, you know."

"Certainly, Mr. Dick," said I; "come in!"

When his hair was smoothed down comfortably into his eyes, Mrs Prig and
Mrs Gamp put on his neckerchief; adjusting his shirt collar with great
nicety, so that the starched points should also invade those organs, and
afflict them with an artificial ophthalmia. His waistcoat and coat
were next arranged; and as every button was wrenched into a wrong
button-hole, and the order of his boots was reversed, he presented on
the whole rather a melancholy appearance.

‘Coming directly, sir.’

‘Do you remember, John, on the day we were married, Pa’s speaking of the
ships that might be sailing towards us from the unknown seas?’

INTRODUCTION

“Hell’s fire!” cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. “Let me
go!”

Here Mr Venus interposed, and remarked that he conceived Mr Boffin to
have taken the description literally; the rather, forasmuch as he, Mr
Venus, had himself supposed the menial to have contracted an affliction
or a habit of the nose, involving a serious drawback on the pleasures of
social intercourse, until he had discovered that Mr Wegg’s description
of him was to be accepted as merely figurative.

FOOTNOTE:

‘What?’ exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.

‘Oh, never mind,’ said Kenwigs, glancing at Mr. Lumbey, who, having
rashly taken charge of little Lillyvick, found nobody disposed to
relieve him of his precious burden. ‘All friends here.’

‘He is tall,’ said the girl, ‘and a strongly made man, but not
stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over
his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don’t forget
that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any
other man’s, that you might almost tell him by that alone. His face
is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can’t be more than
six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often
discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has
desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them
with wounds--why did you start?’ said the girl, stopping suddenly.

She was engaged in very nimbly and dexterously making lace.  A
lace-pillow lay upon her breast; and the quick movements and changes of
her hands upon it as she worked, had given them the action he had
misinterpreted.

“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “If
you had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—”

“Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last
Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to
the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”

‘He raised his eyes to the old man’s countenance, and paused. He lifted
the light to his face, set it gently down, and left the apartment.

ABOUT noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to
pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of
reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude, of
which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary extent
in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends,
and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so much
trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin laid
great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in and cherished
him, when without his timely aid he might have perished with hunger;
and related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom in
his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but
who, proving unworthy of his confidence, and evincing a desire to
communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hung at the
Old Bailey one morning. Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share
in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the
wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question
had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain
evidence for the crown, which, if it were not precisely true, was
indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few
select friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable
picture of the discomforts of hanging, and, with great friendliness and
politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hope that he might never be
obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.

‘Not only that,’ pursued Fanny, ‘but she gives the same charge to
Young Sparkler; and doesn’t let him come after me until she has got it
thoroughly into his most ridiculous of all ridiculous noddles (for one
really can’t call it a head), that he is to pretend to have been first
struck with me in that Inn Yard.’

I was too bashful to do so then--I was afraid of confusing her, and I
was no less afraid of confusing myself.--but I informed myself of the
hour at which she left of an evening, in order that our visit might
be timed accordingly; and taking leave of Mr. Omer, and his pretty
daughter, and her little children, went away to my dear old Peggotty’s.

In the summer-time Granny had a little garden at the back of the hut
where she raised, with little Gretchen's help, a few potatoes and
turnips and onions. These she carefully stored away for winter use. To
this meager supply, the pennies, gained by selling the twigs from the
forest, added the oatmeal for Gretchen and a little black coffee for
Granny. Meat was a thing they never thought of having. It cost too much
money. Still, Granny and Gretchen were very happy, because they loved
each other dearly. Sometimes Gretchen would be left alone all day long
in the hut because Granny would have some work to do in the village
after selling her bundle of sticks and twigs. It was during these long
days that little Gretchen had taught herself to sing the song which the
wind sang to the pine branches. In the summer-time she learned the
chirp and twitter of the birds, until her voice might almost be
mistaken for a bird's voice; she learned to dance as the swaying
shadows did, and even to talk to the stars which shone through the
little square window when Granny came home too late or too tired to
talk.

And now the hand that traces these words falters as it approaches the
conclusion of its task, and would weave for a little longer space the
thread of these adventures.

‘I did not expect any. But when I heard a step, I thought it--sounded
like yours.’

"'Glad to hear it, sir!' says I; 'I had my doubts;'--throwing as much
of knowingness into my look as befitted a confidential managing common
law-clerk when speaking to his governor.

‘But where’s my brother-in-law, Sir Mulberry?’ inquired Mrs. Nickleby. ‘I
shouldn’t be here without him. I hope he’s coming.’

Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to
say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a
much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it
within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he
said in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed.

‘Drink! He’d drink the Thames up, if it was strong enough, sir,’ replied
John Willet. ‘He’ll have something when he gets home. He’s better
without it, now, sir.’

‘I appear for the defendant, my Lord,’ said Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.

‘What did you think of ‘em, Sir?’

Compton, Mrs., letter to, ii. 22

The Midshipman was all alive. Mr Toots and Susan had arrived at last.
Susan had run upstairs like a young woman bereft of her senses, and Mr
Toots and the Chicken had gone into the Parlour.

CHAPTER 36. — ENTHUSIASM

‘Sing out,’ whispered Mr. Jennings Rodolph.

MY DEAR FECHTER,

‘A pretty thing it would be, wouldn’t it to go and stop at the very
first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come
up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a
cart with handcuffs on,’ said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. ‘No! I
shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and
not stop till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set
eyes on. ‘Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I’ve got a head; for if
we hadn’t gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back
across country, yer’d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago,
my lady. And serve yer right for being a fool.’

"Not a wery nice neighbourhood this, sir," said Sam, with a touch of
the hat, which always preceded his entering into conversation with his
master.

Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him
by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own
pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy
up.

The beautiful table-cover was a most cheering surprise to me when I came
home last night, and I lost not a moment in finding a table for it,
where it stands in a beautiful light and a perfect situation. Accept my
heartiest thanks for a present on which I shall set a peculiar and
particular value.

"So I goes upstairs, and there I finds Master Harry on an e-nor-mous
sofa a-drying the eyes of Miss Norah with his pocket handkercher. Their
little legs was entirely off the ground, of course, and it really is not
possible to express how small them children looked. 'It's Cobbs! it's
Cobbs!' cries Master Harry, and he comes a-runing to me, and catching
hold of my hand. Miss Norah, she comes running to me on t'other side,
and catching hold of my t'other hand, and they both jump for joy. And
what I had took to be the case was the case.

“Not the man I know?”

‘My dearest love,’ said he, ‘what could I do?  Knowing you were alone,
was it possible that I could stay away?’

‘Why, he has sauntered into the Arts at a leisurely Pall-Mall pace,’
said Doyce, ‘and I doubt if they care to be taken quite so coolly.’

‘What has he ever done to you, John?’

I despised them, to a man. Frozen-out old gardeners in the flower-beds
of the heart, I took a personal offence against them all. The Bench was
nothing to me but an insensible blunderer. The Bar had no more
tenderness or poetry in it, than the Bar of a public-house.

The natural phenomena of which he has been the victim, are of a most
astounding nature.  He has had two children who have never grown up; who
have never had anything to cover them at night; who have been continually
driving him mad, by asking in vain for food; who have never come out of
fevers and measles (which, I suppose, has accounted for his fuming his
letters with tobacco smoke, as a disinfectant); who have never changed in
the least degree through fourteen long revolving years.  As to his wife,
what that suffering woman has undergone, nobody knows.  She has always
been in an interesting situation through the same long period, and has
never been confined yet.  His devotion to her has been unceasing.  He has
never cared for himself; he could have perished—he would rather, in
short—but was it not his Christian duty as a man, a husband, and a
father,—to write begging letters when he looked at her?  (He has usually
remarked that he would call in the evening for an answer to this
question.)

“Me. Only me,” replied a tremulous voice.

‘I’ll tell you what, Capper,’ said Mr. Mincin to our host, as he closed
the room door after the lady had retired, ‘you have very great reason to
be fond of your wife.  Sweet woman, Mrs. Capper, sir!’  ‘Nay, Mincin—I
beg,’ interposed the host, as we were about to reply that Mrs. Capper
unquestionably was particularly sweet.  ‘Pray, Mincin, don’t.’  ‘Why
not?’ exclaimed Mr. Mincin, ‘why not?  Why should you feel any delicacy
before your old friend—_our_ old friend, if I may be allowed to call you
so, sir; why should you, I ask?’  We of course wished to know why he
should also, upon which our friend admitted that Mrs. Capper _was_ a very
sweet woman, at which admission Mr. Mincin cried ‘Bravo!’ and begged to
propose Mrs. Capper with heartfelt enthusiasm, whereupon our host said,
‘Thank you, Mincin,’ with deep feeling; and gave us, in a low voice, to
understand, that Mincin had saved Mrs. Capper’s cousin’s life no less
than fourteen times in a year and a half, which he considered no common
circumstance—an opinion to which we most cordially subscribed.

Therefore I see nothing at all to the credit of Chancery in these cases,
but everything to its discredit. And as to owing it to Chancery to bear
testimony to its having rendered justice in two such plain matters, I
have no debt of the kind upon my conscience.

‘Mr Pinch,’ said Mary, ‘you mistake him.’

On Saturday, the twentieth of January, one thousand six hundred and
forty-nine, this memorable trial began. The House of Commons had
settled that one hundred and thirty-five persons should form the Court,
and these were taken from the House itself, from among the officers of
the army, and from among the lawyers and citizens. John Bradshaw,
serjeant-at-law, was appointed president. The place was Westminster
Hall. At the upper end, in a red velvet chair, sat the president, with
his hat (lined with plates of iron for his protection) on his head. The
rest of the Court sat on side benches, also wearing their hats. The
King’s seat was covered with velvet, like that of the president, and
was opposite to it. He was brought from St. James’s to Whitehall, and
from Whitehall he came by water to his trial.

‘Extremely probable,’ he answered. ‘Some Mississippi or Missouri lot, I
dare say.’

In spite of the belief in his own powers, which Ensign Spoonbill
encouraged, he could not shut his eyes to the fact that he was every day
a loser; but wiser gamblers than he--if any there be--place reliance on
a “turn of luck,” and all he wanted to enable him to take advantage of
it, was a command of cash; for even one’s best friends prefer the coin
of the realm to the most unimpeachable I. O. U.

‘Do not put itself out of humour,’ said Mr. Mantalini, breaking an egg.
‘It is a pretty, bewitching little demd countenance, and it should not
be out of humour, for it spoils its loveliness, and makes it cross and
gloomy like a frightful, naughty, demd hobgoblin.’

John Westlock shook his head.

“Ah!” cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid
with admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!” (I don’t know who
Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person
present); “that’s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever
forgiving and ever affable. It might,” said the servile Pumblechook,
putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to a
common person, have the appearance of repeating—but _may_ I—?”

‘I an’t married, Mister,’ observed Clemency.

‘Not to me,’ said Mr Fips. ‘I act upon instructions.’

‘Good!’ said Mr Boffin. ‘Very good! Now let us hear what they’re all
about; will you be so good?’

“Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
citizen.”

Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in
a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a
goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda
Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master
Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and
getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private
property, conferred upon his son and heir in honor of the day) into his
mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to
show his linen in the fashionable parks. And now two smaller Cratchits,
boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they
had smelt the goose and known it for their own, and basking in
luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced
about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while
he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire
until the slow potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the saucepan lid
to be led out and peeled.

“Well, Sir,” said Mrs Pipchin, “I can say nothing to the contrary.”

‘Well, sir,’ he said, bowing and chuckling, and tucking in the ends
of his neckerchief at his breast: ‘I thankee, sir, I thankee! I do my
endeavours in my line of life, sir.’

“In answer to this dissuasion of mine, he wrote me as manly and
    straightforward, but withal, as modest a letter, as ever I read in my
    life.  He explained to me how limited his ambition was: soaring no
    higher than the establishment of his wife in some light business, and
    the better education of his children.  He set before me the
    difference between his evening and holiday studies, such as they
    were; and the having no better resource than an ale-house or a
    skittle-ground.  He told me how every small addition to his stock of
    knowledge made his Sunday walks the pleasanter, the hedge-flowers
    sweeter, everything more full of interest and meaning to him.

‘No, but really! Our place is,’ said the easy young Barnacle, ‘the most
inoffensive place possible. You’ll say we are a humbug. I won’t say
we are not; but all that sort of thing is intended to be, and must be.
Don’t you see?’

“Yes,” added the second, “and it was a ‘locket and gold ring.’ We
found out that, and saw it given you. We were bye. Oh! we were bye.”

‘I must trust to chance, Mr Varden.’

With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay
for the liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their
roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an
emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following
night.

When Grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple, and Prince
Certainpersonio had made a speech, and everybody had cried Hip hip hip
hurrah! Grandmarina announced to the King and Queen that in future there
would be eight quarter days in every year, except in leap year, when there
would be ten. She then turned to Certainpersonio and Alicia, and said, "My
dears, you will have thirty-five children, and they will all be good and
beautiful. Seventeen of your children will be boys, and eighteen will be
girls. The hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally. They
will never have the measles, and will have recovered from the
whooping-cough before being born."

‘How often have I told you,’ said Ralph, ‘and how often am I to tell
you, that you run no risk? What have you sworn, or what are you asked to
swear, but that at such and such a time a boy was left with you in the
name of Smike; that he was at your school for a given number of years,
was lost under such and such circumstances, is now found, and has been
identified by you in such and such keeping? This is all true; is it
not?’

But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him
with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the
dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon
him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,
could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap
of black.

CHAPTER XVII.
OLIVER’S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON
TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION

"'Tis merry in Hall, when Beards wag all,"

“Here is a visitor.”

And well might those who saw us off,
      Our many perils long discuss,
    Because, ere we were out of sight,
      'Twas certainly "all up with us!"

But the night-coach had a punctual character, and it was time to join
it at the office; which was so near at hand that they had already sent
their luggage and arranged to walk. Thither the whole party repaired,
therefore, after no more delay than sufficed for the equipment of the
Miss Pecksniffs and Mrs Todgers. They found the coach already at its
starting-place, and the horses in; there, too, were a large majority
of the commercial gentlemen, including the youngest, who was visibly
agitated, and in a state of deep mental dejection.

I have considered the terms on which I could afford just now to sell Mr.
Braham the acting copyright in London of an entirely new piece for the
St. James's Theatre; and I could not sit down to write one in a single
act of about one hour long, under a hundred pounds. For a new piece in
two acts, a hundred and fifty pounds would be the sum I should require.

‘And if I should tell you everything,’ said Newman, hesitating.

Jeffrey, Lord, i. 184, 218

What gorgeous china figures of knights and ladies, gilded till they
gleamed again, I might have bought at the Fair for the garniture of my
home, if I had been a French-Flemish peasant, and had had the money!
What shining coffee-cups and saucers I might have won at the turntables,
if I had had the luck!  Ravishing perfumery also, and sweetmeats, I might
have speculated in, or I might have fired for prizes at a multitude of
little dolls in niches, and might have hit the doll of dolls, and won
francs and fame.  Or, being a French-Flemish youth, I might have been
drawn in a hand-cart by my compeers, to tilt for municipal rewards at the
water-quintain; which, unless I sent my lance clean through the ring,
emptied a full bucket over me; to fend off which, the competitors wore
grotesque old scarecrow hats.  Or, being French-Flemish man or woman, boy
or girl, I might have circled all night on my hobby-horse in a stately
cavalcade of hobby-horses four abreast, interspersed with triumphal cars,
going round and round and round and round, we the goodly company singing
a ceaseless chorus to the music of the barrel-organ, drum, and cymbals.
On the whole, not more monotonous than the Ring in Hyde Park, London, and
much merrier; for when do the circling company sing chorus, _there_, to
the barrel-organ, when do the ladies embrace their horses round the neck
with both arms, when do the gentlemen fan the ladies with the tails of
their gallant steeds?  On all these revolving delights, and on their own
especial lamps and Chinese lanterns revolving with them, the thoughtful
weaver-face brightens, and the Hôtel de Ville sheds an illuminated line
of gaslight: while above it, the Eagle of France, gas-outlined and
apparently afflicted with the prevailing infirmities that have lighted on
the poultry, is in a very undecided state of policy, and as a bird
moulting.  Flags flutter all around.  Such is the prevailing gaiety that
the keeper of the prison sits on the stone steps outside the prison-door,
to have a look at the world that is not locked up; while that agreeable
retreat, the wine-shop opposite to the prison in the prison-alley (its
sign La Tranquillité, because of its charming situation), resounds with
the voices of the shepherds and shepherdesses who resort there this
festive night.  And it reminds me that only this afternoon, I saw a
shepherd in trouble, tending this way, over the jagged stones of a
neighbouring street.  A magnificent sight it was, to behold him in his
blouse, a feeble little jog-trot rustic, swept along by the wind of two
immense gendarmes, in cocked-hats for which the street was hardly wide
enough, each carrying a bundle of stolen property that would not have
held his shoulder-knot, and clanking a sabre that dwarfed the prisoner.

"What is the name of the house?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

"The Founder of the Feast indeed!" cried Mrs. Cratchit,
reddening. "I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece
of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good
appetite for it."

They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full
half-hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from
their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes
himself. At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street,
nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if
conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping
on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and
apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on
the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which
looked as if it had hung there for many years.

_Heading to Chapter IX_                                          136

‘I am sure of that,’ said Clennam. ‘Can you suppose I doubt it?’

Of his works, thus:

‘Indeed, my darling,’ said Fanny, ‘that’s just as it may happen. Here he
is again. Look at him. O, you simpleton!’

Then, manfully despising
      The pale faces' yoke,
    Let your tribes see you rising
      Till your chains is broke!"

The first was a patched and much-soiled skeleton suit; one of those
straight blue cloth cases in which small boys used to be confined,
before belts and tunics had come in, and old notions had gone out: an
ingenious contrivance for displaying the full symmetry of a boy’s
figure, by fastening him into a very tight jacket, with an ornamental
row of buttons over each shoulder, and then buttoning his trousers over
it, so as to give his legs the appearance of being hooked on, just
under the armpits. This was the boy’s dress. It had belonged to a town
boy, we could see; there was a shortness about the legs and arms of the
suit; and a bagging at the knees, peculiar to the rising youth of
London streets. A small day-school he had been at, evidently. If it had
been a regular boys’ school they wouldn’t have let him play on the
floor so much, and rub his knees so white. He had an indulgent mother
too, and plenty of halfpence, as the numerous smears of some sticky
substance about the pockets, and just below the chin, which even the
salesman’s skill could not succeed in disguising, sufficiently
betokened. They were decent people, but not overburdened with riches,
or he would not have so far outgrown the suit when he passed into those
corduroys with the round jacket; in which he went to a boys’ school,
however, and learnt to write—and in ink of pretty tolerable blackness,
too, if the place where he used to wipe his pen might be taken as
evidence.

"Yes," said Mrs. Micawber. "It is truly painful to contemplate mankind
in such an aspect, Master Copperfield, but our reception was, decidedly,
cool. There is no doubt about it. In fact, that branch of my family
which is settled in Plymouth became quite personal to Mr. Micawber,
before we had been there a week."

With kindest love and regard to all your house,

But Edith stopped him, in a voice which, although not raised in the
least, was so clear, emphatic, and distinct, that it might have been
heard in a whirlwind.

"Ah, you dog! You're joking," said Tackleton.

‘You see.’

My place, I found, was one of the lowest in the firm of Murdstone &
Grinby, with boys of no education and in quite an inferior station to
myself--my duties were to wash the bottles, stick on labels, and so on.
I was utterly miserable at being degraded in this way, when I thought of
my former companions, Steerforth and Traddles, and my hopes of becoming
a learned and famous man, and shed bitter tears, as I feared I would
forget all I had learnt at school. My lodging, one bare little room, was
in the house of some people named Micawber, shiftless, careless,
good-natured people, who were always in debt and difficulties. I felt
great pity for their misfortunes and did what I could to help poor Mrs.
Micawber to sell her books and other little things she could spare, to
buy food for herself, her husband, and their four children. I was too
young and childish to know how to provide properly for myself, and often
found I was obliged to live on bread and slices of cold pudding at the
end of the week. If I had not been a very innocent-minded, good little
boy, I might easily have fallen into bad ways at this time. But God took
care of me and kept me from harm. I would not even tell Peggotty how
miserable I was, for fear of distressing her.

The closing words of the last chapter lead naturally to the commencement
of this, its successor; for it has to do with a church. With the church,
so often mentioned heretofore, in which Tom Pinch played the organ for
nothing.

‘Papa,’ she said, all mystery and whisper, as she shut down the tea-pot
lid, ‘is sitting prosingly breaking his new laid egg in the back parlour
over the City article exactly like the Woodpecker Tapping and need never
know that you are here, and our little friend you are well aware may be
fully trusted when she comes down from cutting out on the large table
overhead.’

On entering the passage, Arthur was passed by a stranger with a knapsack
in his hand, who was evidently leaving the house.

Now whether the tall horse, in the natural playfulness of his
disposition, was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with
Mr. Winkle, or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the
journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one,
are points upon which, of course, we can arrive at no definite and
distinct conclusion. By whatever motives the animal was actuated,
certain it is that Mr. Winkle had no sooner touched the reins, than he
slipped them over his head, and darted backwards to their full length.

Mr. Jinks did so.

Mr Boffin hurried out, and found her on the dark staircase, panting,
with a lighted candle in her hand.

Years passed, the apple-branches
A deeper shadow shed;
And many a time the Judas Tree,
Blossom and leaf, lay dead;
When on the loitering western breeze
Came the bells' merry sound,
And flowery arches rose, and flags
And banners waved around.

In sudden low spirits, Twemlow replies, ‘I don’t think he would.’

‘He’s newly married, and he brings his young wife home to-night,’ said
the barber. ‘So I’m going to fetch my lodger away--Mr Chuzzlewit’s,
close behind the Post Office--and carry her box for her.’

‘For rest and relief.’

Pancks put the counter question, ‘What else?’ It packed up, in the
smallest compass, a weight that had rested on Clennam’s life; and he
made no answer.

The Halle is the very concentration and impersonation of French vinous
hilarity. It would not do for port and sherry, which require a more
solid and stately residence; nor is it sufficiently whimsical and
mediæval to serve as a rendezvous for Rhenish, Austrian, and Hungarian
volunteers in the grand army of Jean Raisin. Rudesheimer, Voeslan,
Gumpoldskirchen, or Luttenberg, could not well sojourn comfortably in
any place that had not a touch of a ruined castle in its architecture.
But the Entrepôt, whose first stone was laid little more than forty
years back, no more pretends to an elderly and dignified mien than
does the Bal Mabille (by daylight) or the Château des Fleurs. It is
as tasteful and as elegant as if intended to serve as a suburban
luncheon-place, where you might call for any known wine in the world,
to be sipped under the shade of flowering shrubs, to the accompaniment
of sandwiches, sausage-rolls, and ices, handed to you by white-aproned
waiters or rosy-cheeked and smart-capped damsels.

Affectionately yours.

"Quite."

"Never mind," replied his companion, "it will soon be over. Steady,
steady."

Serjeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant;
    and a very long and a very emphatic address he delivered, in which he
    bestowed the highest possible eulogiums on the conduct and character
    of Mr. Pickwick.  He attempted to show that the letters which had
    been exhibited, merely related to Mr. Pickwick's dinner, or to the
    preparations for receiving him in his apartments on his return from
    some country excursion.  It is sufficient to add in general terms,
    that he did the best he could for Mr. Pickwick; and the best, as
    everybody knows on the infallible authority of the old adage, could
    do no more.

If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy’s dress, there might have
been some reason for the Jew’s opening his eyes so wide; but as he had
discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his
leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting
so much attention in a public-house.

“This, however,” said Mr Toots, “is not the point. The company of Susan
has been, I assure you, Miss Dombey, a consolation and satisfaction to
me, in my state of mind, more easily conceived than described. The
journey has been its own reward. That, however, still, is not the
point. Miss Dombey, I have before observed that I know I am not what is
considered a quick person. I am perfectly aware of that. I don’t think
anybody could be better acquainted with his own—if it was not too
strong an expression, I should say with the thickness of his own
head—than myself. But, Miss Dombey, I do, notwithstanding, perceive the
state of—of things—with Lieutenant Walters. Whatever agony that state
of things may have caused me (which is of no consequence at all), I am
bound to say, that Lieutenant Walters is a person who appears to be
worthy of the blessing that has fallen on his—on his brow. May he wear
it long, and appreciate it, as a very different, and very unworthy
individual, that it is of no consequence to name, would have done!
That, however, still, is not the point. Miss Dombey, Captain Gills is a
friend of mine; and during the interval that is now elapsing, I believe
it would afford Captain Gills pleasure to see me occasionally coming
backwards and forwards here. It would afford me pleasure so to come.
But I cannot forget that I once committed myself, fatally, at the
corner of the Square at Brighton; and if my presence will be, in the
least degree, unpleasant to you, I only ask you to name it to me now,
and assure you that I shall perfectly understand you. I shall not
consider it at all unkind, and shall only be too delighted and happy to
be honoured with your confidence.”

“No, to be sure.”

‘I don’t care,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I’ll bring the action.’

‘Look at my torturer,’ he replied. ‘Before him I have step by step
abandoned name and reputation, peace and quiet, house and home.’

There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and
there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of
cold roast, and there was a great piece of cold boiled, and there were
mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening
came after the roast and boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind!
The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have
told it him!) struck up "Sir Roger de Coverley." Then old Fezziwig
stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too, with a good,
stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of
partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who _would_
dance, and had no notion of walking.

Calnek and Savary, 5.

The hand released from the child’s hair, had fallen, trembling, into
Trotty’s hand.  So Trotty, talking without intermission, led him out as
tenderly and easily as if he had been a child himself.  Returning before
Meg, he listened for an instant at the door of her little chamber; an
adjoining room.  The child was murmuring a simple Prayer before lying
down to sleep; and when she had remembered Meg’s name, ‘Dearly,
Dearly’—so her words ran—Trotty heard her stop and ask for his.

"A customer!--only one, Tim?"

"'We're going to be married, Cobbs, at Gretna Green,' says the boy.
'We've run away on purpose. Norah has been in rather low spirits, Cobbs;
but she'll be happy now we have found you to be our friend.'

‘You are very kind,’ returned Mr. Pickwick, shaking me by the hand again;
‘you are so exactly what I expected!  But for what particular purpose do
you think I have sought you, my dear sir?  Now what _do_ you think I have
come for?’

The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of
recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away,
beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs.
They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low
earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small
back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.

The dismal man readily complied: a circle was again formed round the
table, and harmony once more prevailed. Some lingering irritability
appeared to find a resting-place in Mr. Winkle's bosom, occasioned
possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat--though it is
scarcely reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have
excited even a passing feeling of anger in a Pickwickian breast. With
this exception, their good humour was completely restored; and the
evening concluded with the conviviality with which it had begun.

‘Humph!  And when is he going?’

‘Persons!’ ejaculated Mrs. Taunton.

"Will you step forward?" said the officer.

"No, no.  I can't leave Theophile.  I want the good dear Theophile."

"All is now over; and, upon one point at least, I am at length enabled
to set the minds of your readers at rest. The three professors arrived
at ten minutes after two o'clock, and, instead of taking up their
quarters at the Original Pig, as it was universally understood in the
course of yesterday that they would assuredly have done, drove straight
to the Pig and Tinder-box, where they threw off the mask at once, and
openly announced their intention of remaining. Professor Wheezy _may_
reconcile this very extraordinary conduct with _his_ notions of fair
and equitable dealing, but I would recommend Professor Wheezy to be
cautious how he presumes too far upon his well-earned reputation. How
such a man as Professor Snore, or, which is still more extraordinary,
such an individual as Professor Doze, can quietly allow himself to be
mixed up with such proceedings as these, you will naturally inquire.
Upon this head, rumour is silent; I have my speculations, but forbear
to give utterance to them just now."

"Wery good, sir," replied Mr. Weller.

“It’s according to my custom when particular warmed up by any agitation,
sir,” he offered by way of apology.  “And really, I am throwed into that
state of amaze by finding you brought acquainted with Phœbe, that I—that
I think I will, if you’ll excuse me, take another rounder.”  Which he
did, seeming to be greatly restored by it.

When I heard of this approaching ceremony, I was so anxious to see them
all come in, one after another, though I knew the greater part of them
already, and they me, that I got an hour's leave of absence from
Murdstone and Grinby's, and established myself in a corner for that
purpose. As many of the principal members of the club as could be got
into the small room without filling it, supported Mr. Micawber in front
of the petition, while my old friend Captain Hopkins (who had washed
himself, to do honor to so solemn an occasion) stationed himself close
to it, to read it to all who were unacquainted with its contents. The
door was then thrown open, and the general population began to come in,
in a long file: several waiting outside, while one entered, affixed his
signature, and went out. To everybody in succession, Captain Hopkins
said: "Have you read it?"--"No."--"Would you like to hear it read?" If
he weakly showed the least disposition to hear it, Captain Hopkins, in a
loud sonorous voice, gave him every word of it. The Captain would have
read it twenty thousand times, if twenty thousand people would have
heard him, one by one. I remember a certain luscious roll he gave to
such phrases as "The people's representatives in Parliament assembled,"
"Your petitioners therefore humbly approach your honorable house," "His
gracious Majesty's unfortunate subjects," as if the words were something
real in his mouth, and delicious to taste; Mr. Micawber, meanwhile,
listening with a little of an author's vanity, and contemplating (not
severely) the spikes on the opposite wall.

"Say no more!" returned Obenreizer.  "In your place I should have done
the same.  My good friend, I take no offence.  I thank you for your
compliment.  We shall be travelling companions, at any rate," added
Obenreizer.  "You go, as I go, at once?"

It is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor
relations. Indeed great men have often more than their fair share of
poor relations, inasmuch as very red blood of the superior quality,
like inferior blood unlawfully shed, WILL cry aloud and WILL be
heard. Sir Leicester’s cousins, in the remotest degree, are so many
Murders in the respect that they “will out.” Among whom there are
cousins who are so poor that one might almost dare to think it would
have been the happier for them never to have been plated links upon
the Dedlock chain of gold, but to have been made of common iron at
first and done base service.

‘Better--much better!’ replied Oliver, hastily.

“Aye!” says Weevle, “Here I am, Mr. Snagsby.”

"But you will come back?" said Mrs. Pott.

The firm of Barbox Brothers had been some offshoot or irregular branch of
the Public Notary and bill-broking tree.  It had gained for itself a
griping reputation before the days of Young Jackson, and the reputation
had stuck to it and to him.  As he had imperceptibly come into possession
of the dim den up in the corner of a court off Lombard-street, on whose
grimy windows the inscription Barbox Brothers had for many long years
daily interposed itself between him and the sky, so he had insensibly
found himself a personage held in chronic distrust, whom it was essential
to screw tight to every transaction in which he engaged, whose word was
never to be taken without his attested bond, whom all dealers with openly
set up guards and wards against.  This character had come upon him
through no act of his own.  It was as if the original Barbox had
stretched himself down upon the office-floor, and had thither caused to
be conveyed Young Jackson in his sleep, and had there effected a
metempsychosis and exchange of persons with him.  The discovery—aided in
its turn by the deceit of the only woman he had ever loved, and the
deceit of the only friend he had ever made: who eloped from him to be
married together—the discovery, so followed up, completed what his
earliest rearing had begun.  He shrank, abashed, within the form of
Barbox, and lifted up his head and heart no more.

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Friday Evening, May 19th, 1854._

“Touch then.” It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.

‘I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to
visit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of
notice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed
to me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,’ said my mother
simply.

These were not all the horrors of the time. The wicked and dissolute,
in wild desperation, sat in the taverns singing roaring songs, and were
stricken as they drank, and went out and died. The fearful and
superstitious persuaded themselves that they saw supernatural
sights—burning swords in the sky, gigantic arms and darts. Others
pretended that at nights vast crowds of ghosts walked round and round
the dismal pits. One madman, naked, and carrying a brazier full of
burning coals upon his head, stalked through the streets, crying out
that he was a Prophet, commissioned to denounce the vengeance of the
Lord on wicked London. Another always went to and fro, exclaiming, ‘Yet
forty days, and London shall be destroyed!’ A third awoke the echoes in
the dismal streets, by night and by day, and made the blood of the sick
run cold, by calling out incessantly, in a deep hoarse voice, ‘O, the
great and dreadful God!’

‘Now,’ said Jack Hopkins, ‘just to set us going again, Bob, I don’t mind
singing a song.’ And Hopkins, incited thereto by tumultuous applause,
plunged himself at once into ‘The King, God bless him,’ which he sang as
loud as he could, to a novel air, compounded of the ‘Bay of Biscay,’ and
‘A Frog he would.’ The chorus was the essence of the song; and, as each
gentleman sang it to the tune he knew best, the effect was very striking
indeed.

"Are there no prisons?" said the Spirit, turning on him for the last
time with his own words. "Are there no workhouses?"

"The modern world will smile, but should however beware of too hastily
despising works that charmed Lady Mary Wortley in her youth, and were
courageously defended by Madame de Sevigné even when hers was past, and
they began to be sliding out of fashion. She, it seems, thought with the
_old woman_ just now mentioned, that they had a tendency to elevate the
mind, and to instil honourable and generous sentiments. At any rate they
must have fostered application and perseverance, by accustoming their
readers to what the French term _des ouvrages de longue haleine_. After
resolutely mastering Clelia, nobody could pretend to quail at the aspect
of Mezeray, or even at that of Holinshed's Chronicle printed in black
letter. Clarendon, Burnet, and Rapin, had not yet issued into daylight."

“Whatever their efficiency may be,” she returned, “you know them all
now. I have no more.”

‘With some money, of course?’

“Nothing, guardian.”

"Yes. If _you_ think so," said I.

As the warmth of the cheerful day began to shed itself upon the scanty
crowd, the murmur of tongues was heard, shutters were thrown open,
and blinds drawn up, and those who had slept in rooms over against the
prison, where places to see the execution were let at high prices, rose
hastily from their beds. In some of the houses, people were busy taking
out the window-sashes for the better accommodation of spectators; in
others, the spectators were already seated, and beguiling the time with
cards, or drink, or jokes among themselves. Some had purchased seats
upon the house-tops, and were already crawling to their stations from
parapet and garret-window. Some were yet bargaining for good places, and
stood in them in a state of indecision: gazing at the slowly-swelling
crowd, and at the workmen as they rested listlessly against the
scaffold--affecting to listen with indifference to the proprietor’s
eulogy of the commanding view his house afforded, and the surpassing
cheapness of his terms.

“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk such
nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest
of his family?”

OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON, AND ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF
YOUNG GENTLEMAN.

‘Well! and that’s a fact!’ said the waiter, looking helplessly at me:
‘Right away.’

You will have read in the papers that the Thames in London is most horrible.
I have to cross Waterloo or London Bridge to get to the railroad when I
come down here, and I can certify that the offensive smells, even in
that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending
nature. Nobody knows what is to be done; at least everybody knows a
plan, and everybody else knows it won't do; in the meantime cartloads of
chloride of lime are shot into the filthy stream, and do something I
hope. You will know, before you get this, that the American telegraph
line has parted again, at which most men are sorry, but very few
surprised. This is all the news, except that there is an Italian Opera
at Drury Lane, price eighteenpence to the pit, where Viardot, by far the
greatest artist of them all, sings, and which is full when the dear
opera can't let a box; and except that the weather has been
exceptionally hot, but is now quite cool. On the top of this hill it has
been cold, actually cold at night, for more than a week past.

Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old
woman, returned, and, telling him it was a board night, informed him
that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.

‘A Lemon has pips,
    And a Yard has ships,
    And _I_’ll have Chips!’

‘Well, my life,’ said Peggotty, giving me a squeeze, ‘I have thought of
it night and day, every way I can, and I hope the right way; but I’ll
think of it again, and speak to my brother about it, and in the meantime
we’ll keep it to ourselves, Davy, you and me. Barkis is a good plain
creature,’ said Peggotty, ‘and if I tried to do my duty by him, I think
it would be my fault if I wasn’t--if I wasn’t pretty comfortable,’
said Peggotty, laughing heartily. This quotation from Mr. Barkis was
so appropriate, and tickled us both so much, that we laughed again and
again, and were quite in a pleasant humour when we came within view of
Mr. Peggotty’s cottage.

With that Mr Dombey stalked away to his own dressing-room, and Mrs
Dombey went upstairs to hers. Mrs Skewton and Florence repaired to the
drawing-room, where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on
her to shed a few irrepressible tears, supposed to be forced from her
by her daughter’s felicity; and which she was still drying, very
gingerly, with a laced corner of her pocket-handkerchief, when her
son-in-law appeared.

Chapter 81

"I do not doubt that she has left you the best credentials?" said Mr.
Wilding.

And dear Mrs Lammle and dear Mr Lammle, how do you do, and when are
you going down to what’s-its-name place—Guy, Earl of Warwick, you
know—what is it?—Dun Cow—to claim the flitch of bacon? And Mortimer,
whose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers, by reason
first of fickleness and then of base desertion, how do YOU do, wretch?
And Mr Wrayburn, YOU here! What can YOU come for, because we are all
very sure before-hand that you are not going to talk! And Veneering,
M.P., how are things going on down at the house, and when will you turn
out those terrible people for us? And Mrs Veneering, my dear, can it
positively be true that you go down to that stifling place night after
night, to hear those men prose? Talking of which, Veneering, why don’t
you prose, for you haven’t opened your lips there yet, and we are dying
to hear what you have got to say to us! Miss Podsnap, charmed to see
you. Pa, here? No! Ma, neither? Oh! Mr Boots! Delighted. Mr Brewer!
This IS a gathering of the clans. Thus Tippins, and surveys Fledgeby and
outsiders through golden glass, murmuring as she turns about and about,
in her innocent giddy way, Anybody else I know? No, I think not. Nobody
there. Nobody THERE. Nobody anywhere!

[1] Report of Mr. Bowie on the cause of Cholera in Bermondsey.

Take a regular, ponderous, rickety, London hackney-coach of the old
school, and let any man have the boldness to assert, if he can, that he
ever beheld any object on the face of the earth which at all resembles
it, unless, indeed, it were another hackney-coach of the same date. We
have recently observed on certain stands, and we say it with deep
regret, rather dapper green chariots, and coaches of polished yellow,
with four wheels of the same colour as the coach, whereas it is
perfectly notorious to every one who has studied the subject, that
every wheel ought to be of a different colour, and a different size.
These are innovations, and, like other miscalled improvements, awful
signs of the restlessness of the public mind, and the little respect
paid to our time-honoured institutions. Why should hackney-coaches be
clean? Our ancestors found them dirty, and left them so. Why should we,
with a feverish wish to ‘keep moving,’ desire to roll along at the rate
of six miles an hour, while they were content to rumble over the stones
at four? These are solemn considerations. Hackney-coaches are part and
parcel of the law of the land; they were settled by the Legislature;
plated and numbered by the wisdom of Parliament.

After running on, in this way, for some time, Mr Swiveller softly
opened the office door, with the intention of darting across the street
for a glass of the mild porter.  At that moment he caught a parting
glimpse of the brown head-dress of Miss Brass flitting down the kitchen
stairs.  ‘And by Jove!’ thought Dick, ‘she’s going to feed the small
servant.  Now or never!’

After some days of inquiry and research, Arthur Clennam became convinced
that the case of the Father of the Marshalsea was indeed a hopeless one,
and sorrowfully resigned the idea of helping him to freedom again. He
had no hopeful inquiry to make at present, concerning Little Dorrit
either; but he argued with himself that it might--for anything he
knew--it might be serviceable to the poor child, if he renewed this
acquaintance. It is hardly necessary to add that beyond all doubt he
would have presented himself at Mr Casby’s door, if there had been no
Little Dorrit in existence; for we all know how we all deceive
ourselves--that is to say, how people in general, our profounder selves
excepted, deceive themselves--as to motives of action.

‘I _know _it is,’ said Mr. Weller.

Durfy held a moment's conversation with Murphy, who now advanced to
the squire, and begged to assure him there must be some mistake in the
business, for that he had never committed the impertinence of which he
was accused.

‘No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.’

‘I think Agnes is going to be married.’

‘At this time, I was so fortunate as to hear of the child, and
immediately hastened to Hanover to see her.  I found her with a
well-formed figure; a strongly-marked, nervous-sanguine temperament; a
large and beautifully-shaped head; and the whole system in healthy
action.  The parents were easily induced to consent to her coming to
Boston, and on the 4th of October, 1837, they brought her to the
Institution.

The old man sighed, and still sat cowering before the fire. Mr Jonas
shook his Britannia-metal teaspoon at him, and taking a loftier
position, went on to argue the point on high moral grounds.

‘There’s a friend of mine, sir, that had the intention of spending
the evening with me when I gave you up—much against my will—for the
night.’

‘Don’t mention it,’ returned Mr Meagles, ‘I am sure you are quite
welcome. And now, Mr Clennam, perhaps I may ask you whether you have yet
come to a decision where to go next?’

‘I will tell you what I should, under any other circumstances, as soon
have thought of telling to--Jack Ketch.’

Thus ended Peggotty's narration. From the moment of my knowing of the
death of my mother, the idea of her as she had been of late had vanished
from me. I remembered her, from that instant, only as the young mother
of my earliest impressions, who had been used to wind her bright curls
round and round her finger, and to dance with me at twilight in the
parlor. What Peggotty had told me now, was so far from bringing me back
to the later period, that it rooted the earlier image in my mind. It may
be curious, but it is true. In her death she winged her way back to her
calm untroubled youth, and cancelled all the rest.

She moved towards him, and stooped down. He muttered a word in her
ear; and, wringing her hands, she paced up and down the room like one
distracted. The blind man, with perfect composure, produced his bottle
again, mixed another glassful; put it up as before; and, drinking from
time to time, followed her with his face in silence.

After trying the leg with a finger, and two fingers, and one hand and
two hands, and over and under, and up and down, and in this direction
and in that, and approvingly remarking on the points of interest to
another gentleman who joined him, the surgeon at last clapped the
patient on the shoulder, and said, ‘He won’t hurt. He’ll do very well.
It’s difficult enough, but we shall not want him to part with his leg
this time.’ Which Clennam interpreted to the patient, who was full of
gratitude, and, in his demonstrative way, kissed both the interpreter’s
hand and the surgeon’s several times.

Mr. Tupman, with a trembling voice, read the letter, of which the
    following is a copy:--

‘These two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hour’s time,’ she said,
taking her into the bar; ‘and your best plan will be to sup with them.
Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something that’ll do you
good, for I’m sure you must want it after all you’ve gone through
to-day.  Now, don’t look after the old gentleman, because when you’ve
drank that, he shall have some too.’

At half-past ten--late hours for the square--there appeared a little
tray of sandwiches and a bowl of bishop, which bishop coming on the top
of the double-diamond, and other excitements, had such an effect
upon Tim Linkinwater, that he drew Nicholas aside, and gave him to
understand, confidentially, that it was quite true about the uncommonly
handsome spinster, and that she was to the full as good-looking as she
had been described--more so, indeed--but that she was in too much of a
hurry to change her condition, and consequently, while Tim was courting
her and thinking of changing his, got married to somebody else. ‘After
all, I dare say it was my fault,’ said Tim. ‘I’ll show you a print
I have got upstairs, one of these days. It cost me five-and-twenty
shillings. I bought it soon after we were cool to each other. Don’t
mention it, but it’s the most extraordinary accidental likeness you ever
saw--her very portrait, sir!’

"Tell me," said the boy, imploringly, "oh, do tell me, _will_ you
go--_will_ you?"

Philadelphia is most bountifully provided with fresh water, which is
showered and jerked about, and turned on, and poured off, everywhere.
The Waterworks, which are on a height near the city, are no less
ornamental than useful, being tastefully laid out as a public garden, and
kept in the best and neatest order.  The river is dammed at this point,
and forced by its own power into certain high tanks or reservoirs, whence
the whole city, to the top stories of the houses, is supplied at a very
trifling expense.

“Never seek to find in me,” said Edith, laying her hand upon her
breast, “what is not here. Never if you can help it, Florence, fall off
from me because it is not here. Little by little you will know me
better, and the time will come when you will know me, as I know myself.
Then, be as lenient to me as you can, and do not turn to bitterness the
only sweet remembrance I shall have.”

"Well, sir," sighed my aunt. "All I have got to say about it, is, that
if it's gone, I can bear it; and if it's not gone, I shall be glad to
get it back."

‘I have need of them,’ she replied. ‘I am growing old, both in years and
care. Perhaps that, and too much trial, have made them weaker than they
used to be. Do not speak to me.’

“Fagin,” said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;
“is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it’s safely done from the
outside?”

"And I suppose that the ghost ordered you to hand the milk to the young
gentlemen when he had done?"--"Me, sir! Heaven save me! I never se'ed a
ghost in my life."

“No,” replied Mr. Limbkins; “at least, as it’s a nasty business, we
think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.”

I shook hands with Mr. Peggotty, and passed into the kitchen, while he
softly closed the door. Little Emily was sitting by the fire, with her
hands before her face. Ham was standing near her.

I had added one hundred louis to the baron's capital. Whilst I was
in search of my hat to make my escape, A---- had been employed in
preparing an écarté pack, and offered to give me my _revanche_; our host
encouraging me to take it by saying he would back me.

The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far
as the big coat-sleeves would let them go.

‘No, I will not let either of you say anything of the kind,’ returned
Miss Snevellicci. ‘You must come home and see mama, who only came to
Portsmouth today, and is dying to behold you. Led, my dear, persuade Mr
Johnson.’

"They are going also," said Mr. Pickwick.

We must confess that we looked forward with no slight impatience to the
announcement of supper; for if you wish to see a tame lion under
particularly favourable circumstances, feeding-time is the period of
all others to pitch upon. We were therefore very much delighted to
observe a sensation among the guests, which we well knew how to
interpret, and immediately afterwards to behold the lion escorting the
lady of the house down-stairs. We offered our arm to an elderly female
of our acquaintance, who—dear old soul!—is the very best person that
ever lived, to lead down to any meal; for, be the room ever so small,
or the party ever so large, she is sure, by some intuitive perception
of the eligible, to push and pull herself and conductor close to the
best dishes on the table;—we say we offered our arm to this elderly
female, and, descending the stairs shortly after the lion, were
fortunate enough to obtain a seat nearly opposite him.

‘—We must not lose sight of you. We must not let you pass out of our
knowledge. We must know all about you.’

Heaving a long-drawn sigh, Mr. Stiggins paused for a response. Sam
nodded, and Mr. Weller the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound,
which, being neither a groan, nor a grunt, nor a gasp, nor a growl,
seemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four.

With this, Number Twenty Eight retired, after a glance between him and
Uriah; as if they were not altogether unknown to each other, through
some medium of communication; and a murmur went round the group, as his
door shut upon him, that he was a most respectable man, and a beautiful
case.

Tavistock House, purchase of, i. 240;
    sale of, ii. 107;
    letters concerning, i. 259, 261-266

"Yes, sir," stammered the boy.  The gentleman who spoke last was
unconsciously right. It would have been _very_ like a Christian, and a
marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who
fed and took care of _him_.  But he hadn't, because nobody had taught
him.

"I have found it out, Miss," said Mrs. Lewis; "Joe is in love."

The gentleman’s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked
three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young
cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with
something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so
designated, an involuntary process?

‘No, no, not in Bristol,’ replied Mr. Ben Allen, jerking his thumb over
his right shoulder; ‘over that way--down there. But, hush, here’s Bob.
Not a word, my dear friend, not a word.’

"Man! did I say so?  Do I whisper the secrets of the Vehmgericht?
I say she died that night: and he--he, the heartless, the villain,
the betrayer,--you saw him seated in yonder curiosity shop, by
yonder guillotine, with his scoundrelly head in his lap.

‘Lord bless my soul!’ cried Mr. Spiker.

‘They’re all in, Sir.’

‘Please to give me a glass of the wine of the country.’

“Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment.”

“You know why not, Esther. If you were living in an unfinished house,
liable to have the roof put on or taken off—to be from top to bottom
pulled down or built up—to-morrow, next day, next week, next month,
next year—you would find it hard to rest or settle. So do I. Now?
There’s no now for us suitors.”

He withdrew with another bow and without a word; opening the door
no wider than was sufficient for his passage out; and shutting it as
carefully as before. The chairman of the board employed the rest of the
morning in affixing his sign-manual of gracious acceptance to various
new proposals of annuity-purchase and assurance. The Company was looking
up, for they flowed in gayly.

‘No, no. Nothing else.’

"It is human nature.  Did you ever observe a thwarted child
striking in its anger the unoffending nurse, destroying its toys to
discharge its wrath?  Did you ever see a schoolboy, unable to wreak
his anger on the bigger boy who has just struck him, turn against
the nearest smaller boy and beat him?  Did you ever know a
schoolmaster, angered by one of the boy's parents, vent his pent-up
spleen upon the unoffending class?  Did you ever see a subaltern
punished because an officer had been reprimanded?  These are
familiar examples of vicarious vengeance.  When the soul is stung
to fury, it must solace itself by the discharge of that fury--it
must relieve its pain by the sight of pain in others.  We are so
constituted.  We need sympathy above all things.  In joy we cannot
bear to see others in distress; in distress we see the joy of
others with dismal envy which sharpens our pain.  That is human
nature."

“They say what the torrents rushing down by Chamouni say!”

I hope to be back with you before you write to me!

‘And I say of both of you,’ added Mr Meagles, ‘that you are well
matched. You keep him in check, Clennam, with your common sense, and you
stick to the Works, Dan, with your--’

"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder
a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely
valuable." The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.

‘What right!’ cried the single gentleman, drawing the arm of Kit’s
mother more tightly through his own, for that good woman evidently had
it in contemplation to run away.  ‘A right you little dream of.  Mind,
good people, if this fellow has been marrying a minor--tut, tut, that
can’t be.  Where is the child you have here, my good fellow.  You call
her Nell.  Where is she?’

‘Partner,’ said Wegg, even more insinuatingly than before, ‘I propose
that we cut it in half, and each keep a half.’

‘All’s over now,’ said the vintner. ‘Fifty thousand pounds will be
scattered in a minute. We must save ourselves. We can do no more, and
shall have reason to be thankful if we do as much.’

"Listen!" said the other Shadows.

This evening the Veneerings give a banquet. Eleven leaves in the
Twemlow; fourteen in company all told. Four pigeon-breasted retainers in
plain clothes stand in line in the hall. A fifth retainer, proceeding up
the staircase with a mournful air—as who should say, ‘Here is another
wretched creature come to dinner; such is life!’—announces, ‘Mis-ter
Twemlow!’

(_Slow music. Apparition of Old Clipclose rises through the stage,
    dressed in a white shirt, and scarlet nightcap._)

With this tender remembrance upon me, I was cavalierly shunted back into
Dullborough the other day, by train.  My ticket had been previously
collected, like my taxes, and my shining new portmanteau had had a great
plaster stuck upon it, and I had been defied by Act of Parliament to
offer an objection to anything that was done to it, or me, under a
penalty of not less than forty shillings or more than five pounds,
compoundable for a term of imprisonment.  When I had sent my disfigured
property on to the hotel, I began to look about me; and the first
discovery I made, was, that the Station had swallowed up the
playing-field.

‘I thought you--spoke,’ said Arthur, hesitating what name to give the
interruption.

"And her feet?" inquired L----, gasping for breath, "has she--club
feet?"

Not there. Not there. She would have been a stranger sight in her old
home now, even than that home had been at first, without her. But a lady
sat in the familiar place, from whose heart she had never passed away;
in whose true memory she lived, unchanging, youthful, radiant with all
promise and all hope; in whose affection--and it was a mother's now:
there was a cherished little daughter playing by her side--she had no
rival, no successor; upon whose gentle lips her name was trembling then.

“It’s a lie!” said Oliver.

"Nothing--whatever it is--seems to have done anybody much good who comes
here," she returned in her simple way; "but I want to learn, just the
same."

He had not left the room in darkness many minutes, when the head again
appeared, and Sim Tappertit entered, bearing in his hand a little lamp.

"Have you--did anybody--has nothing been heard--about me?"

‘I must be a prisoner for a little while,’ said Agnes, ‘but here are the
old books, Trotwood, and the old music.’

Sam continued to sit on the large stone, meditating upon what was best
to be done, and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the
doors within five miles of Bristol, taking them at a hundred and fifty
or two hundred a day, and endeavouring to find Miss Arabella by that
expedient, when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might
have sat there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it.

‘It is not often,’ he said, ‘Martin, that my daughters and I desert our
quiet home to pursue the giddy round of pleasures that revolves abroad.
But we think of doing so to-day.’

Mr. Winkle, stooping forward, with his body half doubled up, was being
assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a very singular and un-swan-like
manner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite
bank--

"No, indeed I do not, my dear sir," replied Arabella. "I never have
forgotten it. I have never ceased to think how great your sufferings
must have been in this shocking place. But I hoped that what no
consideration for yourself would induce you to do, a regard to our
happiness might. If my brother hears of this, first, from you, I feel
certain we shall be reconciled. He is my only relation in the world,
Mr. Pickwick, and unless you plead for me I fear I have lost even him.
I have done wrong, very, very wrong, I know." Here poor Arabella hid
her face in her handkerchief, and wept bitterly.

‘Come up and see the room,’ said the host of The Two Robins, leading the
way to the staircase quite briskly, considering how fat he was.

And in some sort, Mr Carker, in his fancy, basked upon a hearth too.
Coiled up snugly at certain feet, he was ready for a spring, Or for a
tear, or for a scratch, or for a velvet touch, as the humour took him
and occasion served. Was there any bird in a cage, that came in for a
share of his regards?

‘Pray don’t distress yourself,’ said Martin; ‘we must bear it.’

Kit was for a moment disposed to be vexed by this contradiction, and
not the less so from having anticipated it in his own mind and knowing
how just it was.  But the impulse was only momentary, and the vexed
look became a kind one before it had crossed the room.

No wonder then, that I parted from Biddy with regret. I sat with her
till we heard the quartermaster scrape his feet at the hall-door on his
return from his club, and kissing poor Biddy tenderly, as Roger entered
by the front, I levanted by the back-door. I fancied myself desperately
in love, and was actually dreaming of my dulcinea when my aunt's maid
called me before day, to prepare for the stage-couch that was to convey
me to my regiment in Dublin.

‘The ribaldry of this miserable man is despicably disgusting,’ said
Pott, pretending to address Bob Sawyer, and scowling upon Slurk.

I am a neat hand at cookery, and I'll tell you what I knocked up for my
Christmas-eve dinner in the Library Cart.  I knocked up a
beefsteak-pudding for one, with two kidneys, a dozen oysters, and a
couple of mushrooms thrown in.  It's a pudding to put a man in good
humour with everything, except the two bottom buttons of his waistcoat.
Having relished that pudding and cleared away, I turned the lamp low, and
sat down by the light of the fire, watching it as it shone upon the backs
of Sophy's books.

‘Did _you_ ever hear a tom-tom, sir?’ sternly inquired the captain, who
lost no opportunity of showing off his travels, real or pretended.

The stranger suffered a short pause to elapse, and then asked abruptly,
‘What do you mean?’

Tennyson's _Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington_ ranks as a
funeral dirge with _Lycidas_ and _Adonais_. Napoleon's tomb in the
Invalides may hold its own almost with the Tàj. Yet, when all is said
and done, the fact remains that no hero of the battle, and indeed few
victims of war, have ever received a more touching memorial than the
one here set forth in the sight of all future generations of men by
the love and the literary genius of Lady De Lancey.

It made me sigh to think of him.

"Oh," said Wardle, "you don't know, eh? Take this cheese to Mr.
Pickwick."

After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:—

‘Pooh, pooh!  Don’t you talk nonsense, my good fellow,’ said Mr.
Bounderby, ‘about things you don’t understand; and don’t you call the
Institutions of your country a muddle, or you’ll get yourself into a real
muddle one of these fine mornings.  The institutions of your country are
not your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind
your piece-work.  You didn’t take your wife for fast and for loose; but
for better for worse.  If she has turned out worse—why, all we have got
to say is, she might have turned out better.’

It was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity through
a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured
to halt by one consent beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained
silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates
uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight, and, bursting into an
uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a door-step, and
rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.

‘I think,’ observed Clennam musing, ‘I by chance know what occasion--I
mean into whose pocket the money is to go.’

“‘Under favour, Sir,’ replied the horror-struck sexton, ‘I don’t think
they can, Sir; they don’t know me, Sir, I don’t think the gentlemen have
ever seen me, Sir.’

‘I admit that I am rather uneasy, my own.’

But not a word said Mr Pinch. The words he would have uttered died upon
his lips, and found a life more spiritual in self-denying thoughts.

“Proud, eh?” exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer.—“Come, that’s too
much.”

He yielded to her imperious but elated look, and turned her chair back
to the place from which he had wheeled it. In doing so he saw elation
in the face of Mr Flintwinch, which most assuredly was not inspired by
Flora. This turning of his intelligence and of his whole attempt and
design against himself, did even more than his mother’s fixedness and
firmness to convince him that his efforts with her were idle. Nothing
remained but the appeal to his old friend Affery.

“Like the dear good Tox, you are!” said Louisa.

“Mr. Jarndyce can’t say fairer than that, you understand,” observed
Mr. Bucket to his fellow-visitor. “And it being now made clear to you
that nobody’s a-going to be wronged—which must be a great relief to
YOUR mind—we may proceed with the ceremony of chairing you home
again.”

‘You’ll admit that he must be a Fool,’ said Peartree.

Noggs nodded; and as he nodded, there came a ring at the office bell.
The master looked up from his papers, and the clerk calmly remained in a
stationary position.

"There," said Sam, throwing in the last carpet-bag. "There they are!"

‘Never mind,’ said Wardle, after a short pause. ‘They’ll turn up
presently, I dare say. I never wait supper for anybody.’

‘No,’ said Tom, ‘no. I shall walk to Salisbury to-night. I couldn’t stay
here. For goodness’ sake, don’t make me so unhappy, Mrs Lupin.’

‘And now, Mr Lightwood, was she ever,’ pursues Podsnap, with his
indignation rising high into those hair-brushes of his, ‘a factory
girl?’

"You see this?" said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.

He's a med'cine for Ireland, in portable papers;
  The infallible cure for political vapours;
  A neat label round it his 'prentices tie--
  'Put your trust in the Lord, and keep this powder dry!'
                              Tol de rol.

‘You’ll be asked the question down town,’ said the man. ‘They won’t let
you be more than a Casual there. They’ll pass you on to your settlement,
Missis, with all speed. You’re not in a state to be let come upon
strange parishes ’ceptin as a Casual.’

‘I have taken leave of you,’ said I, wresting my hand away. ‘You dog,
I’ll know no more of you.’

"Now, I'll tell you what, young Copperfield," said he, "the wine shall
be kept to wet your whistle when you are story-telling."

One day Charles was in disgrace with his elderly relation, who had
exerted sufficient authority to make him a captive in his chamber.
He was prohibited from seeing any one but me; and, of course, a most
urgent messenger was sent to me express. I found him in his chamber,
sitting by the fire, with a pile of ghostly tales, and an accumulation
of lead, which he was casting into dumps in a mould. Dumps, the
inexperienced reader must know, are flat circles of lead,--a sort of
petty quoits,--with which schoolboys amused themselves half a century
ago, and perhaps do so still, unless the march of mind has marched off
with such vanities. No doubt, in the "astounding progress of intellect,"
the time will arrive when boys will play at philosophers instead of
playing at soldiers,--will fight with wooden arguments instead of wooden
swords,--and pitch leaden syllogisms instead of leaden dumps. Charles
was before the dawn of this new light. He had cast several hundred
dumps, and was still at work. The quibble did not occur to me at the
time; but, in after years, I never heard of a man in the dumps without
thinking of my schoolfellow. His position was sufficiently melancholy.
His chamber was at the end of a long corridor. He was determined not
to make any submission, and his captivity was likely to last till the
end of his holidays. Ghost-stories, and lead for dumps, were his stores
and provisions for standing the siege of _ennui_. I think, with the aid
of his sister, I had some share in making his peace; but, such is the
association of ideas, that, when I first read in Lord Byron's Don Juan,

"'None in the world,' replied Father Paul, answering him quite politely;
and all the while, poor Tom shaking like a Quaker.

My best love to Katie, and to Charley, and to our Charley, and to all
friends. If I could only get to the point of being able to hold my head
up and dispense with my pocket-handkerchief for five minutes, I should
be all right.

“Who can help it!” cried Mrs. Tetterby.

Caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual
working-room, which served them for their ordinary living-room as well;
and a strange place it was. There were houses in it, finished and
unfinished, for dolls of all stations in life. Tenement houses for dolls
of moderate means; kitchens and single apartments for dolls of the lower
classes; capital town residences for dolls of high estate. Some of these
establishments were already furnished with a view to the needs of dolls
of little money; others could be fitted on the most expensive scale, at
a moment's notice, from whole shelves of chairs and tables, sofas,
bedsteads, and upholstery. The nobility and gentry and public in
general, for whose use these doll-houses were planned, lay, here and
there, in baskets, staring straight up at the ceiling; but in showing
their degrees in society, and keeping them in their own stations (which
is found to be exceedingly difficult in real life), the makers of these
dolls had far improved on nature, for they, not resting on such marks as
satin, cotton-print, and bits of rag, had made differences which allowed
of no mistake. Thus, the doll-lady of high rank had wax limbs of perfect
shape; but only she and those of her grade; the next grade in the social
scale being made of leather; and the next coarse linen stuff. As to the
common-people, they had just so many matches out of tinder-boxes for
their arms and legs, and there they were--established in their place at
once, beyond the possibility of getting out of it.

‘You must be very much bored here?’ was the inference he drew from the
communication.

There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie
appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by
a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an
attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter
in the streets when he went out.

"No, no," said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver's old
friend. "Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,
and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste!"

"Never mind that matter now," said Mr. Pickwick, hastily, "I want to
speak to you about something else. Sit down."

"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Pickwick.

I begin to discover in your riper years, that you have been secretly
vain of your handwriting all your life. For I swear I see no change in
it! What it always was since I first knew it (a year or two!) it _is_.
This I will maintain against all comers.

Ever yours,
                             My block-reeving,
                             Main-brace splicing,
                             Lead-heaving,
                             Ship-conning,
                             Stun'sail-bending,
                             Deck-swabbing
                             Son of a sea-cook,
                                            HENRY BLUFF,
                                                      H.M.S. _Timber._

It was in vain for me to try to change the subject, as I used to try,
only for the sake of novelty or perhaps because—but I need not be so
particular. Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it.

‘But you are locked in too,’ said Arthur.

'It's--it's--only a gentleman, Ma'am,' said Mr. Pickwick from behind
    the curtains.

"I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis."

“But he was a child once,” said the old man. “He played with children.
Before he lay down on his bed at night, and fell into his guiltless rest,
he said his prayers at his poor mother’s knee. I have seen him do it,
many a time; and seen her lay his head upon her breast, and kiss him.
Sorrowful as it was to her and me, to think of this, when he went so
wrong, and when our hopes and plans for him were all broken, this gave
him still a hold upon us, that nothing else could have given. Oh,
Father, so much better than the fathers upon earth! Oh, Father, so much
more afflicted by the errors of Thy children! take this wanderer back!
Not as he is, but as he was then, let him cry to Thee, as he has so often
seemed to cry to us!”

‘Get along with you!’ said Mrs. Weller, pushing him away.

‘A nasty, ungrateful, pig-headed, brutish, obstinate, sneaking
dog,’ exclaimed Mrs. Squeers, taking Smike’s head under her arm, and
administering a cuff at every epithet; ‘what does he mean by that?’

‘Said, Henrietta!’ cried the collector. ‘Didn’t I see him--’ Mr
Lillyvick couldn’t bring himself to utter the word, but he counterfeited
the motion of the eye.

‘Consequently, then,’ said Mr Willet, ‘that chap, whose mother was
hung when he was a little boy, along with six others, for passing bad
notes--and it’s a blessed thing to think how many people are hung in
batches every six weeks for that, and such like offences, as showing how
wide awake our government is--that chap that was then turned loose, and
had to mind cows, and frighten birds away, and what not, for a few pence
to live on, and so got on by degrees to mind horses, and to sleep in
course of time in lofts and litter, instead of under haystacks and
hedges, till at last he come to be hostler at the Maypole for his board
and lodging and a annual trifle--that chap that can’t read nor write,
and has never had much to do with anything but animals, and has never
lived in any way but like the animals he has lived among, IS a animal.
And,’ said Mr Willet, arriving at his logical conclusion, ‘is to be
treated accordingly.’

‘Look here, Hexam.’ Mr Bradley Headstone, highly certificated
stipendiary schoolmaster, drew his right forefinger through one of the
buttonholes of the boy’s coat, and looked at it attentively. ‘I hope
your sister may be good company for you?’

Yes, Mary dear, I must say that I like my Carton, and I have a faint
idea sometimes that if I had acted him, I could have done something with
his life and death.

‘Yes! They cry for joy, my darling,’ her husband struck in. ‘You
understand? These two, whom I come to life to disappoint and dispossess,
cry for joy!’

Such a self-contained man I never saw. But in that quality, as in every
other he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable. Even the
fact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of his
respectability. Nothing could be objected against his surname Littimer,
by which he was known. Peter might have been hanged, or Tom transported;
but Littimer was perfectly respectable.

Those who imagine that all paupers merely claimed parish relief because
the law ordained it, commit a great error. There were numbers who were
hereditary paupers, and that on a tradition carefully handed down, that
they were only manfully claiming their own. They traced their claims
from the most ancient feudal times, when the lord was as much bound to
maintain his villein in gross, as the villein was to work for the lord.
These paupers were, in fact, or claimed to be, the original _adscripti
glebæ_, and to have as much a claim to parish support as the landed
proprietor had to his land. For this reason, in the old Catholic times,
after they had escaped from villenage by running away and remaining
absent from their hundred for a year and a day, dwelling for that period
in a walled town, these people were among the most diligent attendants
at the Abbey doors, and when the Abbeys were dissolved, were, no doubt,
among the most daring of these thieves, vagabonds, and sturdy rogues,
who, after the Robin Hood fashion, beset the highways and solitary farms
of England, and claimed their black mail in a very unceremonious style.
It was out of this class that Henry VIII. hanged his seventy-two
thousand during his reign, and, as it is said, without appearing
materially to diminish their number.

The suburbs and the town itself were now on fire. A number of the
assailants had got in through by-ways unperceived, the rebel inhabitants
fired on the royalists from their windows (many lives of officers were
thus picked off in ambuscade), while, repulsed from an attempt upon the
bridge, the insurgents attempted to ford the river beyond the reach
of the fire of the North Cork Militia. Pressed by numbers totally
disproportionate, the yeomanry obstinately held their ground, and
although suffering heavily themselves, they cheered as they observed
that their own heavy and well-supported fusilade cut down the head of
the rebel column and checked its advance.

"Dear me, Mr. Weller," said the pretty housemaid, meeting Sam at the
door.

Her rage got the better of her again, for a moment; but it passed over
her face like a spasm, and left her smiling.

For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence
of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and
mercy of the board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to
suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect
for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would
have established that sage individual’s prophetic character, once
and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook
in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance
of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that
pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for
all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the
express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and
pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater
obstacle in Oliver’s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly
all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little
hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in
the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and
tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to
feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and
loneliness which surrounded him.

"O Gran," says Jemmy with a full heart, "I am not worthy!"  But he leaned
down and did it.  Then the faltering fingers made out to catch hold of my
sleeve at last, and I believe he was a-trying to kiss me when he died.

Sometimes, on warm, pleasant evenings, the spacious, cheerful hall, with
its tables and chairs, would be almost empty; but on nights like that on
which this story opens, a dark, cold December night, the seats were apt
to be well filled, mostly with slatternly, hard-featured women, and
dull-faced children, who sat staring stolidly about, while the music and
speaking went on; half stupefied by the warmth and tranquillity so
foreign to their lives.

‘You don’t regret?’

Mr. Calton seized the hand of the petticoat-governed little man, and
vowed eternal friendship from that hour. Hicks, who was all admiration
and surprise, did the same.

"No servant of mine," said the knight; "my guest for this evening, and
no more."

‘I opinionate it’s moist perhaps, at certain times,’ returned the man.

Mr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his
heart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power; but
that he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company, where
benevolence took spasmodic forms, where charity was assumed as a
regular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap
notoriety, vehement in profession, restless and vain in action,
servile in the last degree of meanness to the great, adulatory of one
another, and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help
the weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and
self-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down, he
plainly told us. When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by
Mr. Gusher (who had already got one, originated by Mr. Quale), and
when Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a
meeting, including two charity schools of small boys and girls, who
were specially reminded of the widow’s mite, and requested to come
forward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices, I think the wind
was in the east for three whole weeks.

Mr. Weevle reflects for some time. Shakes his head. Decidedly thinks
not.

“Well!” he said, after consideration. “You’re on your oath, you know,
Pip’s comrade?”

‘Are you alone in this house?’

Susan Hopley and Jonathan Bradford? No. Too well known.

‘Wishing ev’ry happiness to this happy family,’ said Mrs Gamp ‘with
all my heart. Good arternoon, Mrs Mould! If I was Mr would I should be
jealous of you, ma’am; and I’m sure, if I was you, I should be jealous
of Mr Mould.’

"Well, Mr. Sawyer," said Mrs. Raddle, planting herself firmly on a
purple cauliflower in the Kidderminster carpet, "and what's that to me,
sir?"

“And—I’m sorry to give you so much trouble, Towlinson,” said Miss Tox,
looking at him pensively.

_Describes, far more fully than the Court Newsman ever did, a
    Bachelor's Party, given by Mr. Bob Sawyer at his Lodgings in the
    Borough_

‘Blacker than last, though that was pitchy too. Didn’t I pass you near
the turnpike in the Oxford Road?’

The bedsteads stood one on each side of the door; and on the inner side
of each was a little path, terminating in a rush-bottomed chair, just
wide enough to admit of a person's getting into or out of bed, on that
side, if he or she thought proper. Having carefully drawn the curtains
of his bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat down on the rush-bottomed
chair, and leisurely divested himself of his shoes and gaiters. He then
took off and folded up his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, and slowly
drawing on his tasselled night-cap, secured it firmly on his head, by
tying beneath his chin the strings which he always had attached to
that article of dress. It was at this moment that the absurdity of his
recent bewilderment struck upon his mind. Throwing himself back in the
rush-bottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick laughed to himself so heartily, that
it would have been quite delightful to any man of well-constituted mind
to have watched the smiles that expanded his amiable features as they
shone forth from beneath the night-cap.

"Go away!" said Miss Betsey (for it was none other), shaking her head
when she saw me, and making a distant chop in the air with her knife.
"Go along!  No boys here!"

It is the custom of that excellent lady when these visits occur, to
appear every three minutes, either in her own person or in that of Mrs.
Tisher, and lay an offering on the shrine of Propriety by affecting to
look for some desiderated article. On the present occasion Miss
Twinkleton, gracefully gliding in and out, says in passing: “How do you
do, Mr. Drood? Very glad indeed to have the pleasure. Pray excuse me.
Tweezers. Thank you!”

Perhaps, after all,—who knows?—Veneering may find this dining, though
expensive, remunerative, in the sense that it makes champions.
Mr Podsnap, as a representative man, is not alone in caring very
particularly for his own dignity, if not for that of his acquaintances,
and therefore in angrily supporting the acquaintances who have taken out
his Permit, lest, in their being lessened, he should be. The gold and
silver camels, and the ice-pails, and the rest of the Veneering table
decorations, make a brilliant show, and when I, Podsnap, casually remark
elsewhere that I dined last Monday with a gorgeous caravan of camels,
I find it personally offensive to have it hinted to me that they are
broken-kneed camels, or camels labouring under suspicion of any sort. ‘I
don’t display camels myself, I am above them: I am a more solid man; but
these camels have basked in the light of my countenance, and how dare
you, sir, insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable
camels?’

‘THE PRESIDENT required some information upon this point.  He had yet to
learn that the human eye was remarkable for the peculiarities of which
the honourable gentleman had spoken.

"I shall not see many more new faces in Trotwood's stead, Wickfield,"
said the Doctor, warming his hands; "I am getting lazy, and want ease. I
shall relinquish all my young people in another six months, and lead a
quieter life."

‘When I appeared to him the most unworthy of his help, I was--I know I
was, for I have often, often, thought about it since--the most inclined
to yield to what he showed me. Oh! if he had relented but a little more;
if he had thrown himself in my way for but one other quarter of an hour;
if he had extended his compassion for a vain, unthinking, miserable
girl, in but the least degree; he might, and I believe he would, have
saved her! Tell him that I don’t blame him, but am grateful for the
effort that he made; but ask him for the love of God, and youth, and
in merciful consideration for the struggle which an ill-advised and
unwakened nature makes to hide the strength it thinks its weakness--ask
him never, never, to forget this, when he deals with one again!’

The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could
have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and,
seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant’s head. But
Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly
terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it
full at that young gentleman.

‘How far is it to London?’ inquired the same speaker.

"Don't know!" said the lady of the caravan; "why, you were there.  I saw
you with my own eyes."

For a whole week after the happy arrival of Mr. Winkle from Birmingham,
Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller were from home all day long, only returning
just in time for dinner, and then wearing an air of mystery and
importance quite foreign to their natures. It was evident that very
grave and eventful proceedings were on foot; but various surmises
were afloat, respecting their precise character. Some (among whom was
Mr. Tupman) were disposed to think that Mr. Pickwick contemplated
a matrimonial alliance; but this idea the ladies most strenuously
repudiated. Others rather inclined to the belief that he had projected
some distant tour, and was at present occupied in effecting the
preliminary arrangements; but this again was stoutly denied by Sam
himself, who had unequivocally stated when cross-examined by Mary that
no new journeys were to be undertaken. At length, when the brains
of the whole party had been racked for six long days, by unavailing
speculation, it was unanimously resolved that Mr. Pickwick should be
called upon to explain his conduct, and to state distinctly why he had
thus absented himself from the society of his admiring friends.

The suggestion being loudly approved of, Mr. Whiffers explained. He
said he certainly could have wished to have continued to hold the
appointment he had just resigned. The uniform was extremely rich and
expensive, the females of the family was most agreeable, and the duties
of the situation was not, he was bound to say, too heavy: the principal
service that was required of him, being, that he should look out of the
hall window as much as possible, in company with another gentleman, who
had also resigned. He could have wished to have spared that company
the painful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter, but
as the explanation had been demanded of him, he had no alternative but
to state, boldly and distinctly, that he had been required to eat cold
meat.

These dropping shots from the blunderbusses of blunderheadedness might
not have hit him in a vital place. But he had to stand against a
trained and well-directed fire of arms of precision too. He had
notoriously threatened the lost young man, and had, according to the
showing of his own faithful friend and tutor who strove so hard for
him, a cause of bitter animosity (created by himself, and stated by
himself), against that ill-starred fellow. He had armed himself with an
offensive weapon for the fatal night, and he had gone off early in the
morning, after making preparations for departure. He had been found
with traces of blood on him; truly, they might have been wholly caused
as he represented, but they might not, also. On a search-warrant being
issued for the examination of his room, clothes, and so forth, it was
discovered that he had destroyed all his papers, and rearranged all his
possessions, on the very afternoon of the disappearance. The watch
found at the Weir was challenged by the jeweller as one he had wound
and set for Edwin Drood, at twenty minutes past two on that same
afternoon; and it had run down, before being cast into the water; and
it was the jeweller’s positive opinion that it had never been re-wound.
This would justify the hypothesis that the watch was taken from him not
long after he left Mr. Jasper’s house at midnight, in company with the
last person seen with him, and that it had been thrown away after being
retained some hours. Why thrown away? If he had been murdered, and so
artfully disfigured, or concealed, or both, as that the murderer hoped
identification to be impossible, except from something that he wore,
assuredly the murderer would seek to remove from the body the most
lasting, the best known, and the most easily recognisable, things upon
it. Those things would be the watch and shirt-pin. As to his
opportunities of casting them into the river; if he were the object of
these suspicions, they were easy. For, he had been seen by many
persons, wandering about on that side of the city—indeed on all sides
of it—in a miserable and seemingly half-distracted manner. As to the
choice of the spot, obviously such criminating evidence had better take
its chance of being found anywhere, rather than upon himself, or in his
possession. Concerning the reconciliatory nature of the appointed
meeting between the two young men, very little could be made of that in
young Landless’s favour; for it distinctly appeared that the meeting
originated, not with him, but with Mr. Crisparkle, and that it had been
urged on by Mr. Crisparkle; and who could say how unwillingly, or in
what ill-conditioned mood, his enforced pupil had gone to it? The more
his case was looked into, the weaker it became in every point. Even the
broad suggestion that the lost young man had absconded, was rendered
additionally improbable on the showing of the young lady from whom he
had so lately parted; for; what did she say, with great earnestness and
sorrow, when interrogated? That he had, expressly and enthusiastically,
planned with her, that he would await the arrival of her guardian, Mr.
Grewgious. And yet, be it observed, he disappeared before that
gentleman appeared.

"Wery well, sir."

‘Yes,’ rejoined Dennis; ‘yes--I may call myself a artist--a fancy
workman--art improves natur’--that’s my motto.’

When that moment had flashed away, he saw that the man striding on
before him was the man who had been so much in his mind during the last
few days. It was no casual resemblance, helped out by the force of
the impression the man made upon him. It was the man; the man he had
followed in company with the girl, and whom he had overheard talking to
Miss Wade.

DEAR TOM,

‘Me!’ exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.

_Pickwick Papers._

Tim looked wistfully at him, for a moment, as if he were encouraged
by the tone of this reply to be more communicative on the subject; and
sticking behind his ear, a pen that he had been making, and shutting up
his knife with a smart click, said,

The stranger answered not; but, first looking back, as though to beckon
to some unseen person outside, came, very deliberately, into the room,
and was closely followed by a little man in brown, very much the worse
for wear, who brought with him a mingled fumigation of stale tobacco and
fresh onions. The clothes of this gentleman were much bespeckled with
flue; and his shoes, stockings, and nether garments, from his heels to
the waist buttons of his coat inclusive, were profusely embroidered with
splashes of mud, caught a fortnight previously--before the setting-in of
the fine weather.

‘Suppose that lad,’ pursued Fagin, ‘was to peach--to blow upon us
all--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then
having a meeting with ‘em in the street to paint our likenesses,
describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where
we might be most easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and
besides to blow upon a plant we’ve all been in, more or less--of his
own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and
brought to it on bread and water,--but of his own fancy; to please
his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested
against us, and peaching to them. Do you hear me?’ cried the Jew,
his eyes flashing with rage. ‘Suppose he did all this, what then?’

‘Leaving L.s.d. behind me,’ said Mr Boffin, by way of commentary, with
another wink.

‘Ah, indeed,’ said Sam. ‘Ve thought ve should ha’ been obliged to
strait-veskit him last night; he’s been a-ravin’ all day; and he says if
he can’t see you afore to-morrow night’s over, he vishes he may be
somethin’ unpleasanted if he don’t drownd hisself.’

VI.

“Only one word more about my Uncle at present, Captain Cuttle. I
suppose it is impossible that he can have written in the ordinary
course—by mail packet, or ship letter, you understand—”

“Do you stay here long, Mr. Drood?” says Neville.

“I say, not far.”

‘What have I done?’ said poor Gabriel. ‘It was agreed that Mr Edward’s
name was never to be mentioned, and I have not spoken of him, have I?’

They advanced steadily; neither quickening their pace as they came
nearer, nor raising any cry, nor showing the least emotion or anxiety.
Though this was a matter of course in the case of regular troops,
even to Barnaby, there was something particularly impressive and
disconcerting in it to one accustomed to the noise and tumult of an
undisciplined mob. For all that, he stood his ground not a whit the less
resolutely, and looked on undismayed.

“In what way?”

‘And to me, George?’

“For the best?” he repeated tenderly. “Of course, for the best. But
here have Ada and I been perfectly forlorn and miserable; here has
your friend Caddy been coming and going late and early; here has
every one about the house been utterly lost and dejected; here has
even poor Rick been writing—to ME too—in his anxiety for you!”

ROYAL HOTEL, DERBY, _Friday, Oct. 22nd, 1858._

‘Now, my dear Pott,’ said little Mr. Perker, ‘the question is, what are
we to do with our friends here?’

[Sidenote: Mr. Edwin Landseer.]

“Tresham,” said Barbox, in a kindly voice, “I have brought you back your
Polly, fast asleep.  Give me your hand, and tell me you are better.”

‘I do hear you, ma’am,’ replied Kate, ‘with surprise--with greater
surprise than I can express.’

"--Has vispered to me," resumed his father, "that it vould be better to
dewote the liquor to vishin' you success and prosperity, and thankin'
you for the manner in which you've brought this here business through.
Here's your health, sir."

Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance,
faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.
Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and
protection.

“My darling,” said Richards, “you wear that pretty black frock in
remembrance of your Mama.”

"This is a description of animal food, Alderman," said Filer, making
little punches in it with a pencil-case, "commonly known to the laboring
population of this country by the name of tripe."

Merrily the tiny fountain played, and merrily the dimples sparkled on
its sunny face. John Westlock hurried after her. Softly the whispering
water broke and fell; as roguishly the dimples twinkled, as he stole
upon her footsteps.

“At last it is come, my dear!”

I have always striven in my writings to express veneration for the life
and lessons of our Saviour; because I feel it; and because I re-wrote
that history for my children--every one of whom knew it from having it
repeated to them--long before they could read, and almost as soon as
they could speak.

The gentleman got off the cask, and stretched himself, observing:

‘I coom home desp’rate.  I coom home wi’out a hope, and mad wi’ thinking
that when I said a word o’ complaint I was reckoned a unreasonable Hand.
I told thee I had had a fright.  It were the Poison-bottle on table.  I
never hurt a livin’ creetur; but happenin’ so suddenly upon ’t, I thowt,
“How can _I_ say what I might ha’ done to myseln, or her, or both!”’

White, Rev. James, letters to, 141, 160

‘Ha ha ha! and did you scratch, and pinch, and struggle, pretty
mistress?’ he cried, as he grasped a little hand that sought in vain to
free itself from his grip: ‘you, so bright-eyed, and cherry-lipped, and
daintily made? But I love you better for it, mistress. Ay, I do. You
should stab me and welcome, so that it pleased you, and you had to
cure me afterwards. I love to see you proud and scornful. It makes you
handsomer than ever; and who so handsome as you at any time, my pretty
one!’

"Yes, sir," replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.

"Not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word.  If suddenly I
were to sink into a deep sleep, from which you could not awake me,
but in that sleep could answer questions with an accuracy which I
could not pretend to when awake,--tell you what money you had in
your pocket, nay, describe your very thoughts,--it is not
necessarily an imposture, any more than it is necessarily
supernatural.  I should be, unconsciously to myself, under a
mesmeric influence, conveyed to me from a distance by a human being
who had acquired power over me by previous rapport."

"Make yourself at home, master," said the shepherd, perhaps a trifle
less heartily than on the first occasion. Not that Fennel had the
least tinge of niggardliness in his composition; but the room was far
from large, spare chairs were not numerous, and damp companions were
not altogether desirable at close quarters for the women and girls in
their bright-colored gowns.

‘Oh!’ said Mr. Bray. ‘These are the orders, are they?’

‘The bailie’s house was in the Canongate, and my uncle was going to the
other end of Leith Walk, rather better than a mile’s journey. On either
side of him, there shot up against the dark sky, tall, gaunt, straggling
houses, with time-stained fronts, and windows that seemed to have shared
the lot of eyes in mortals, and to have grown dim and sunken with age.
Six, seven, eight storey high, were the houses; storey piled upon
storey, as children build with cards--throwing their dark shadows over
the roughly paved road, and making the dark night darker. A few oil
lamps were scattered at long distances, but they only served to mark the
dirty entrance to some narrow close, or to show where a common stair
communicated, by steep and intricate windings, with the various flats
above. Glancing at all these things with the air of a man who had seen
them too often before, to think them worthy of much notice now, my uncle
walked up the middle of the street, with a thumb in each waistcoat
pocket, indulging from time to time in various snatches of song, chanted
forth with such good-will and spirit, that the quiet honest folk started
from their first sleep and lay trembling in bed till the sound died away
in the distance; when, satisfying themselves that it was only some
drunken ne’er-do-weel finding his way home, they covered themselves up
warm and fell asleep again.

‘Very good,’ rejoined Squeers. ‘Then, after my bill was run up, we
picked out five little boys (sons of small tradesmen, as was sure pay)
that had never had the scarlet fever, and we sent one to a cottage where
they’d got it, and he took it, and then we put the four others to sleep
with him, and THEY took it, and then the doctor came and attended ‘em
once all round, and we divided my total among ‘em, and added it on to
their little bills, and the parents paid it. Ha! ha! ha!’

‘Good heavens!’ exclaimed everybody, in simultaneous horror.

“There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,” said
Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. “Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.”

‘I tell you he’s very sorry, don’t I?’ remonstrated Isaac List, ‘and
that he wishes you’d go on.’

‘You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow, I suppose?’ said Mr. Jorkins;
when he had heard me, very restlessly, to an end.

What are you doing??? When are you coming away???? Why are you stopping
there????? Do enlighten me, for I think of you constantly, and have a
true and real interest in your proceedings.

‘They were talking aboot it, doon toon, last neeght,’ replied John, ‘but
neane on ‘em seemed quite to un’erstan’ it, loike.’

Ever affectionately yours.

I expressed myself quite sure of that, and Mr. Barkis, turning his eyes
more gently to his wife, said:

‘Then I will not,’ said Mr Pecksniff. ‘You are quite right, my
dear madam, and I appreciate and thank you for your discriminating
objection--our respected relative, to dispose himself to listen to the
promptings of nature, and not to the--’

“in blood stept in so far”,

“Impossible?”

A FARCE

‘The accommodations are extraordinary,’ said O’Bleary.

It was an impressive tableau. Alfred Jingle, Esquire, alias Captain
Fitz-Marshall, was standing near the door with his hat in his hand, and
a smile on his face, wholly unmoved by his very unpleasant situation.
Confronting him, stood Mr. Pickwick, who had evidently been inculcating
some high moral lesson; for his left hand was beneath his coat tail, and
his right extended in air, as was his wont when delivering himself of an
impressive address. At a little distance, stood Mr. Tupman with
indignant countenance, carefully held back by his two younger friends;
at the farther end of the room were Mr. Nupkins, Mrs. Nupkins, and Miss
Nupkins, gloomily grand and savagely vexed.

‘You do what you can for them!’ repeated Fanny, walking her on very
fast. ‘Would you let a woman like this, whom you could see, if you had
any experience of anything, to be as false and insolent as a woman can
be--would you let her put her foot upon your family, and thank her for
it?’

He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on
a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled
very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the
knife quivered in the air.

The Stockingtonians were chop-fallen, but they were angry and dogged;
and they thronged up to the village and the front of the hall. They
filled the little inn in the hamlet--they went by scores, and roving all
over the churchyard, read epitaphs

His name, sir, was Matthew Price; mine is Benjamin Hardy.  We were born
within a few days of each other; bred up in the same village; taught at
the same school.  I cannot remember the time when we were not close
friends.  Even as boys, we never knew what it was to quarrel.  We had not
a thought, we had not a possession, that was not in common.  We would
have stood by each other, fearlessly, to the death.  It was such a
friendship as one reads about sometimes in books: fast and firm as the
great Tors upon our native moorlands, true as the sun in the heavens.

"Then I'll tell you wot it is," said Mr. Weller, after a short
meditation, "this is a case for that 'ere confidential pal o' the
Chancellorship's. Pell must look into this, Sammy. He's the man for
a difficult question at law. Ve'll have this here brought afore the
Solvent Court directly, Samivel."

"'You have often robbed me, Mr. Snaps,' was the reply; 'I but returned
the compliment. That which you believe is silver plate, manufactured
by Rundell and Bridge, was made at Sheffield, and cost me two hundred
pounds.'

‘This is of far greater moment to me’ said Clennam, in great agitation,
‘than you can imagine. Tell me where you knew the man.’

‘I have seen, sir,’ returned the locksmith with evident reluctance,
‘I have seen in connection with her, something that has filled me with
distrust and uneasiness. She has made bad friends, how, or when, I don’t
know; but that her house is a refuge for one robber and cut-throat at
least, I am certain. There, sir! Now it’s out.’

In reply to this the groom, waxing very wroth, muttered a desire to
damage somebody's person; but disappeared without carrying it into
execution, slamming the door angrily after him, and wholly unheeding
Sam's affectionate request that he would leave him a lock of his hair
before he went.

I am going to propound a mightily grave matter to you. My now periodical
work appears--or I should rather say the first number does--on Saturday,
the 28th of March; and as it has to be sent to America and Germany, and
must therefore be considerably in advance, it is now in hand; I having
in fact begun it on Saturday last. Instead of being published in monthly
parts at a shilling each only, it will be published in weekly parts at
threepence and monthly parts at a shilling; my object being to baffle
the imitators and make it as novel as possible. The plan is a new one--I
mean the plan of the fiction--and it will comprehend a great variety of
tales. The title is: "Master Humphrey's Clock."

‘Favourites?’ repeated Mr. Creakle, with the veins in his forehead
swelling quickly. ‘Who talked about favourites?’

‘Now, I am Chairwoman of Committees!’ cries Lady Tippins.

He was on the move, however; and had his spasms, two to the second, all
right and regular.  But, his sufferings when the clock was going to
strike, were frightful to behold; and, when a Cuckoo looked out of a
trap-door in the Palace, and gave note six times, it shook him, each
time, like a spectral voice—or like a something wiry, plucking at his
legs.

‘He has had few opportunities of pursuing his suit. I have never walked
out alone, or remained alone an instant in his presence. Dear Martin, I
must tell you,’ she continued, ‘that the kindness of your grandfather
to me remains unchanged. I am his companion still. An indescribable
tenderness and compassion seem to have mingled themselves with his old
regard; and if I were his only child, I could not have a gentler father.
What former fancy or old habit survives in this, when his heart has
turned so cold to you, is a mystery I cannot penetrate; but it has been,
and it is, a happiness to me, that I remained true to him; that if he
should wake from his delusion, even at the point of death, I am here,
love, to recall you to his thoughts.’

After putting his horse at Coketown through the storm, as if it were a
leap, he waited up all night: from time to time ringing his bell with the
greatest fury, charging the porter who kept watch with delinquency in
withholding letters or messages that could not fail to have been
entrusted to him, and demanding restitution on the spot.  The dawn
coming, the morning coming, and the day coming, and neither message nor
letter coming with either, he went down to the country house.  There, the
report was, Mr. Bounderby away, and Mrs. Bounderby in town.  Left for
town suddenly last evening.  Not even known to be gone until receipt of
message, importing that her return was not to be expected for the
present.

"You shall have it," he answered; "but I expect you not to injure me."
He fumbled at his pocket for his purse, and while doing so looked
narrowly at the persons by whom he was attacked. They all wore black
crape over their faces, so that not a feature was discernible, and were
clad in very large black frocks. The disguises were complete: it was
impossible to make out anything of their appearance.

The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were
preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly
man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black,
rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.

[[[COURSE OF THE INSURRECTION]]]

I loved him very much, and God knows he deserved it.

“It is a very pleasant one,” said he; “and, if selfish, a novelty too,
worth seeing in you. But I don’t believe that.”

A minute afterwards Openshaw made as though he were going out of the
room; but his wife laid her hand on his arm:

He had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying
the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew’s directions, than
the Dodger returned, accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom
Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally
introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down to breakfast upon
the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home
in the crown of his hat.

I could not help showing that I was a little moved, though I did all
I could to conceal it.

“What have you done with my Mama?”

_Mrs. M._ Is it a pig?

‘The drivers won’t do it.’

“Look here! do you see this? Isn’t it a most wonderful and
extraordinary thing that I can’t call at a man’s house but I find a
piece of this poor-surgeon’s-friend on the staircase? I’ve been lamed
with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death at
last. It will, sir; orange-peel will be my death, or I’ll be content
to eat my own head, sir!” This was the handsome offer with which Mr.
Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made: and it
was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting, for the
sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being ever
brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head
in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig’s head was such a
particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly
entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting—to put
entirely out of the question a very thick coating of powder.

‘Then unfortunately, Miss Wade, you know nothing about them?’

‘Eighteen-pence would do it,’ said Mr. Crummles. ‘You on the top of
a pair of steps with the phenomenon in an attitude; “Farewell!” on a
transparency behind; and nine people at the wings with a squib in each
hand--all the dozen and a half going off at once--it would be very
grand--awful from the front, quite awful.’

It was on witnessing the performance of this latter, and finding his
part in its production was totally ignored--always a sensitive subject
with the combative veteran--that George Cruikshank was incited to make
that public vindication of his claim to a share in the authorship of
this and other works--notably _Oliver Twist_--illustrated by his hand,
and involving the candour and sense of justice of Ainsworth, Dickens,
and himself.

In the present instance, the host or author, in opening his new
establishment, provided no bill of fare.  Sensible of the difficulties of
such an undertaking in its infancy, he preferred that it should make its
own way, silently and gradually, or make no way at all.  It _has_ made
its way, and is doing such a thriving business that nothing remains for
him but to add, in the words of the good old civic ceremony, now that one
dish has been discussed and finished, and another smokes upon the board,
that he drinks to his guests in a loving-cup, and bids them a hearty
welcome.

‘Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.’ said Rose, mastering
the emotions by which she was agitated. ‘As you believe that I am
not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.’

But with no intention of passing many more weary days there. No. I had
resolved to run away.---To go, by some means or other, down into the
country, to the only relation I had in the world, and tell my story to
my aunt, Miss Betsey. I have already observed that I don’t know how this
desperate idea came into my brain. But, once there, it remained there;
and hardened into a purpose than which I have never entertained a more
determined purpose in my life. I am far from sure that I believed there
was anything hopeful in it, but my mind was thoroughly made up that it
must be carried into execution.

The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,
painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the
pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared
at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner,
signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the
lodge.

"'I am her guardian, Tom,' said the old gentleman.

‘If we could have packed the brute off with Georgiana;—but however;
that’s spilled milk.’

The door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject was removed.

“But to be proud and hard to _me_!” Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as
she stretched out her arms. “Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and
hard to _me_!”

"None!" and Lauretta rose with her subject. "As for those Greyham's
girls, I declare a man can't walk for them; and those Miss Highwaters,
they are no better than they should be, I know. Look how they dress!
and we all know what they have to live upon. And those Miss Cartriges,
with their thick ankles, waddling up and down, and looking after the
men: for _my_ part, I never walk without mother's with me, for those
nasty fellows do look at one so."

‘No, no, no, don’t say that, Johnny,’ whimpered his little friend. ‘It’s
very, very bad, but not quite so bad as that. No, no!’

‘And how has this been brought about?’ asked Martin, in dismay.

“Also to see you, Toots, in such good company,” says Doctor Blimber.

“He has none, and no anger. He is indifferent to everything but his
calling. His calling is the acquisition of secrets and the holding
possession of such power as they give him, with no sharer or opponent
in it.”

The girl’s life had been squandered in the streets, and among
the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was
something of the woman’s original nature left in her still; and
when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that
by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the
small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with
the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could
scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this
interview.

Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy
state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.

‘You are frank, honourable, and disinterested,’ said Mr Haredale; ‘you
have forced the conviction that you are so, even on my once-jaundiced
mind, and I believe you. Wait here till I come back.’

Sir Leicester pauses, stares, repeats in a killing voice, “The young
man of the name of Guppy?”

‘How?’ cried the other. ‘Where? Show me the means. Will you give them to
me--will you?’

But how comes Barbara to trip in there? and how smart she is again!
she has been at her glass since she recovered.  How comes Barbara in
the stable, of all places in the world?  Why, since Kit has been away,
the pony would take his food from nobody but her, and Barbara, you see,
not dreaming that Christopher was there, and just looking in, to see
that everything was right, has come upon him unawares.  Blushing little
Barbara!

‘I’ll wash my hands of Mr Dolls physically—’ said Eugene, ‘and be with
you again directly, Mortimer.’

MY DEAR MR. RYLAND,

‘Mr Wrayburn, I cannot tell you now. I cannot tell you to-night, if I
ever can tell you. Pray leave me.’

"That Charles Dickens, Esq., be appointed
        secretary and treasurer to the meeting."

You very likely know that my company of amateurs have lately been
playing, with a great reputation, in London here. The object is, "The
endowment of a perpetual curatorship of Shakespeare's house, to be
always held by some one distinguished in literature, and more especially
in dramatic literature," and we have already a pledge from the
Shakespeare House Committee that Sheridan Knowles shall be recommended
to the Government as the first curator. This pledge, which is in the
form of a minute, we intend to advertise in our country bills.

‘Now Heaven help this silly fellow,’ murmured the perplexed locksmith;
‘can he know this gentleman? His mother’s house is not far off; I had
better see if she can tell me who he is. Barnaby, my man, help me to put
him in the chaise, and we’ll ride home together.’

‘Servant, sir,’ said the one-eyed man to Mr. Pickwick. ‘Fine night,
sir.’

"Ay, fidgety," returned the doctor calmly. "Tut, man, there is nought
ails thee save thine own overweening fancies. Take less of food, more
air, put aside thy flagon, call for thy horse; be boot and saddle the
word! Why,--hast thou not youth?"----

There being nothing more to be done until the Inquest was held next day,
the friends went away together, and Gaffer Hexam and his son went their
separate way. But, arriving at the last corner, Gaffer bade his boy go
home while he turned into a red-curtained tavern, that stood dropsically
bulging over the causeway, ‘for a half-a-pint.’

[Illustration: "_I trust, ma'am," resumed Mr. Pickwick, "that my
unblemished character and the devoted respect I entertain for your
sex----_"]

"It runs in the family, I b'lieve, sir," replied Mr. Weller. "My
father's wery much in that line now. If my mother-in-law blows him up,
he whistles. She flies in a passion, and breaks his pipe; he steps out,
and gets another. Then she screams wery loud, and falls into 'sterics;
and he smokes very comfortably 'till she comes to agin. That's
philosophy, sir, an't it?"

‘Next,’ said Dick, handing the purl, ‘take a pull at that; but moderate
your transports, you know, for you’re not used to it.  Well, is it
good?’

‘Sir, Mrs Hominy!’

VERSE: ONE BY ONE

"In one word, sir," said Mr. Pickwick, "is my servant right in
suspecting that a certain Captain Fitz-Marshall is in the habit of
visiting here? Because," added Mr. Pickwick, as he saw that Mr. Nupkins
was about to offer a very indignant interruption, "because, if he be, I
know that person to be a----"

Biddy said never a single word.

Saying this, the mottled-faced gentleman rose, as did the other
gentlemen. The mottled-faced gentleman reviewed the company, and slowly
lifted his hand, upon which every man (including him of the mottled
countenance) drew a long breath, and lifted his tumbler to his lips.
In one instant the mottled-faced gentleman depressed his hand again,
and every glass was set down empty. It is impossible to describe the
thrilling effect produced by this striking ceremony. At once dignified,
solemn, and impressive, it combined every element of grandeur.

‘That is a black shadow to be following the girl,’ said Steerforth,
standing still; ‘what does it mean?’

‘Dear me,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I never knew that before.’

Mr Dombey, who, besides being generally influenced by his sister for
the reason already mentioned, had really faith in her as an experienced
and bustling matron, acquiesced; and followed her, at once, to the sick
chamber.

There was the same enforced composure on her face, that there had been
when she was dressing; and the wreath upon her head encircled the same
cold and steady brow. But it would have been better to have seen its
leaves and flowers reft into fragments by her passionate hand, or
rendered shapeless by the fitful searches of a throbbing and bewildered
brain for any resting-place, than adorning such tranquillity. So
obdurate, so unapproachable, so unrelenting, one would have thought
that nothing could soften such a woman’s nature, and that everything in
life had hardened it.

[7] Lieutenant Andrew Gordon, R.N., son of the Sheriff of Midlothian.

"I tell you," she returned, "I _will_ speak to her. No power on earth
should stop me, while I was standing here! Have I been silent all these
years, and shall I not speak now? I loved him better than you ever loved
him!" turning on her fiercely. "I could have loved him, and asked no
return. If I had been his wife, I could have been the slave of his
caprices for a word of love a-year. I should have been. Who knows it
better than I? You were exacting, proud, punctilious, selfish. My love
would have been devoted--would have trod your paltry whimpering under
foot!"

I had the great satisfaction of seeing that very evening a lovely
female infant, dressed in a white cassimere cloak and hood, trimmed
with swansdown and rich lace, in the arms of the young man, who
caressed the child with every mark of affection, and called her "his
dear, dear little sister!" I smiled to myself also at seeing this same
young man looking with pleased delight on its small perfect ivory feet,
which I took care to display; and much pleased was I in hearing him for
the first time in his life say with sincerity,

“Pip,” said Joe.

He wished me good-night, and held up his light.  I walked by the side of
the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable sensation of a train
coming behind me) until I found the path.  It was easier to mount than to
descend, and I got back to my inn without any adventure.

I fear she must have a little cap on. There is something coming in the
last part, about her having had a dead child, which makes it yet more
desirable than the existing text does that she should have that little
matronly sign about her. Unless the artist is obdurate indeed, and then
he'll do as he likes.

Cornelius Brook Dingwall, Esq., M.P., was very haughty, solemn, and
portentous. He had, naturally, a somewhat spasmodic expression of
countenance, which was not rendered the less remarkable by his wearing
an extremely stiff cravat. He was wonderfully proud of the M.P.
attached to his name, and never lost an opportunity of reminding people
of his dignity. He had a great idea of his own abilities, which must
have been a great comfort to him, as no one else had; and in diplomacy,
on a small scale, in his own family arrangements, he considered himself
unrivalled. He was a county magistrate, and discharged the duties of
his station with all due justice and impartiality; frequently
committing poachers, and occasionally committing himself. Miss Brook
Dingwall was one of that numerous class of young ladies, who, like
adverbs, may be known by their answering to a commonplace question, and
doing nothing else.

‘That about--my--being--’

She turned her face towards me for a moment, and I knew that I was
right. I could not have resisted its entreaty, if the assurance that it
gave me had been less convincing.

‘Lord bless me, sir!’ replied Brittles, starting violently; ‘I’m the
same as Mr. Giles, sir.’

She stood up, and stretched out her hands in the attitude of blessing
over Susan’s bent head.

"Very unpromising," said Mr. Jorkins.

‘You are a bold woman!’

‘What _is_ a gum-gum?’ eagerly inquired several young ladies.

‘How much might that be?’ Stephen calmly asked.

Mr. Samuel Wilkins was a carpenter, a journeyman carpenter of small
dimensions, decidedly below the middle size—bordering, perhaps, upon
the dwarfish. His face was round and shining, and his hair carefully
twisted into the outer corner of each eye, till it formed a variety of
that description of semi-curls, usually known as ‘aggerawators.’ His
earnings were all-sufficient for his wants, varying from eighteen
shillings to one pound five, weekly—his manner undeniable—his sabbath
waistcoats dazzling. No wonder that, with these qualifications, Samuel
Wilkins found favour in the eyes of the other sex: many women have been
captivated by far less substantial qualifications. But, Samuel was
proof against their blandishments, until at length his eyes rested on
those of a Being for whom, from that time forth, he felt fate had
destined him. He came, and conquered—proposed, and was accepted—loved,
and was beloved. Mr. Wilkins ‘kept company’ with Jemima Evans.

‘Ay!’ said Lord George, ‘let them! Let us see who will venture to attack
a power like ours; the solemn league of a whole people. THIS a madman!
You have said well, very well. I am proud to be the leader of such men
as you.’

And she saw them go with calmness, though, in one or two cases she had
replied to her parents that she had no objection to marry Prince
So-and-so, or Count Such-another, if they desired it--it would be rather
agreeable to have a husband if he gave her plenty of presents and did
all she asked. "Though a sighing and moaning lover, or a man who is
always twiddling a fiddle or making verses I could not stand," she would
add contemptuously.

As she spoke, she struck the ground three times with her foot, muttering
rapidly to herself, when up sprang close to her, a tall tree of the
purest gold, the glittering branches laden with jewels beyond all price.
Seizing one of these, a magnificent emerald, and pulling it off the
branch, again she stamped her foot, and the tree disappeared, leaving
the jewel in her hands.

Shortly after, a dissolution took place, when he hurried off to
Stafford, with the intention of again trying his luck with that
borough. One of his fellow-passengers chanced to be an elector; on
discovering which, Sheridan took the opportunity of asking him for whom
he should vote. The other, ignorant who it was that put the question,
replied that neither of the candidates were much to be depended on,
but that he would vote for the devil sooner than that scamp Sheridan.
The conversation here dropped for a while; but, having in the interim
contrived to learn from the coachman the name of his opponent, Sheridan
resumed the discourse by observing, that he had heard say there were
many corrupt rogues among the Stafford electors, and that among them
was one Thompson, the biggest scoundrel in the borough. "I am Mr.
Thompson," exclaimed his fellow-traveller, crimson with rage. "And I am
Mr. Sheridan," rejoined the other. The joke was immediately seen, and
the parties became sworn friends ever after. Another anecdote, equally
characteristic of Sheridan, is told of him at this period. A few days
after his return to town, having hired a hackney-coach to take him from
Carlton Palace to his own house, he found himself, as usual, without the
means of paying for it. Luckily he espied his friend Richardson in the
street, and, calling to him to get in, he engaged him in a favourite
discussion, which he was well aware would draw forth all his energies;
and then, after adroitly contradicting him, and so rousing his utmost
indignation, he affected to grow angry himself; and, exclaiming that he
would not remain an instant longer in the same coach with a man capable
of holding such language, he insisted on Jehu setting him down, and
walked quietly to his own house, which was now but a few yards off,
leaving his angry friend to pay the fare!

"Are you alone?" he asked hoarsely.

‘I!  I’m a second father to you,’ replied Quilp.

Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he
feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving.

The lad withdrew his eyes, and, putting his hand to his face, moved
towards the door.

Twenty-fourth Day.

There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to
their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a
couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the
table. A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose
listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency
to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked
sternly up to bid some woman “Take that baby out,” when the gravity of
justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother’s
shawl, from some meagre infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome;
the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was
an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the
dock—the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for
depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left
a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the
thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.

Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street
that night. Herbert’s representations that, if I did, I should probably
be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety would
depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding,
again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.
Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my
hurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out
together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left
Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.

‘You may have promised yourself, sir, that you could do what you
chose here, because you had to deal with a mere boy, inexperienced,
friendless, and unassisted. But I give you warning that this mean
calculation is wrong. You have to do with a man also. You have to do
with me. I will support him, and, if need be, require reparation for
him. My hand and heart are in this cause, and are open to him.’

"I feel it more than anybody else," said Mrs. Gummidge; "I'm a lone lorn
creetur', and she used to be a'most the only think that didn't go
contrairy with me."

After which strong avowal Bella underwent reaction, and cried to any
extent, with her face on the back of her chair.

‘I don’t know how it is,’ muttered Ralph, walking up and down the room,
‘but whenever a man dies without any property of his own, he always
seems to think he has a right to dispose of other people’s. What is your
daughter fit for, ma’am?’

"Yes, I know that, but still--"  I stopped with a shudder.

"And the Corporal," pursued Madame Bouclet, "being billeted at the
barber's,--where he will probably remain a long time, for he is attached
to the General,--and finding the poor unowned child in need of being
loved, and finding himself in need of loving,--why, there you have it
all, you see!"

“You will excuse—even you, Major,” replies Mr Dombey, “my entering into
any further detail at present. The intelligence is of a singular kind,
and singularly obtained. It may turn out to be valueless; it may turn
out to be true; I cannot say at present. My explanation must stop
here.”

‘And what if I had been accused of robbing a dead man, Gaffer?’

_Miss S._ Let me see. Oh, yes; the bed will surely cover three.

“At least,” he said to Orient, not sadly, but with a certain vigor of
intention in his tone, “you will allow me to visit you at your mother’s
house?”

“So what?” inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.

He dipped his hand in the water over the boat’s gunwale, and said,
smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:—

My answer was, to pass out at the gate immediately. She made a hasty
gesture with her hand, as if to entreat my patience and my silence, and
turned towards London, whence, as her dress betokened, she had come
expeditiously on foot.

‘I thought it might be agreeable, my dear,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘But perhaps
you’re right.’

AGALMA

We made merry about Dora's wanting to be liked, and Dora said I was a
goose, and she didn't like me at any rate, and the short evening flew
away on gossamer-wings. The time was at hand when the coach was to call
for us. I was standing alone before the fire, when Dora came stealing
softly in, to give me that usual precious little kiss before I went.

The visitor was in the room while it was yet turning round with me
and before I had the power to stir. If I had had it, I should have
hurried away. I had not even the presence of mind, in my giddiness,
to retire to Ada in the window, or to see the window, or to know
where it was. I heard my name and found that my guardian was
presenting me before I could move to a chair.

The large Indiaman was our great attraction because she had come into
the downs in the night. She was surrounded by boats, and we said how
glad the people on board of her must be to come ashore. Charley was
curious, too, about the voyage, and about the heat in India, and the
serpents and the tigers; and as she picked up such information much
faster than grammar, I told her what I knew on those points. I told
her, too, how people in such voyages were sometimes wrecked and cast
on rocks, where they were saved by the intrepidity and humanity of
one man. And Charley asking how that could be, I told her how we knew
at home of such a case.

‘I took the liberty of sending you a message.’

The stranger recognised his friends immediately: and, darting forward
and seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand, dragged him to a seat with
his usual impetuosity, talking all the while as if the whole of the
arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction.

“Often,” answered the first woman.

‘Five minutes after this, the girls were brought down from the bedroom
with a great deal of giggling and modesty; and while the young people
were making themselves perfectly happy, old Lobbs got down the pipe, and
smoked it; and it was a remarkable circumstance about that particular
pipe of tobacco, that it was the most soothing and delightful one he
ever smoked.

"Where does he sleep? What's his number? You know what I mean," said
Steerforth.

‘Very good,’ retorted Perker. ‘And you know how she comes here, I
suppose; I mean on what grounds, and at whose suit?’

The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver’s shoulders with the club;
and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward,
wrested it from his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force
that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.

‘Except that when Pancks told us of your having embarked in this
business and with difficulty persuaded us that it was really you I said
to Mr F.’s Aunt then we would come and ask you if it would be agreeable
to all parties that she should be engaged at our house when required
for I know she often goes to your mama’s and I know that your mama has
a very touchy temper Arthur--Doyce and Clennam--or I never might have
married Mr F. and might have been at this hour but I am running into
nonsense.’

"'Devil have the liars,' says Judy.

‘Secondly, and lastly, what do you want to know?’

The barber declared that Mr. Weller had related one of the most
interesting stories that had ever come within his knowledge, in which
opinion the housekeeper entirely concurred.

When the Duke of Bedford, who was a very able man, began to be active
for England, and, by bringing the war back into France and by holding
the Duke of Burgundy to his faith, to distress and disturb Charles very
much, Charles sometimes asked the Maid of Orleans what the Voices said
about it? But, the Voices had become (very like ordinary voices in
perplexed times) contradictory and confused, so that now they said one
thing, and now said another, and the Maid lost credit every day.
Charles marched on Paris, which was opposed to him, and attacked the
suburb of Saint Honoré. In this fight, being again struck down into the
ditch, she was abandoned by the whole army. She lay unaided among a
heap of dead, and crawled out how she could. Then, some of her
believers went over to an opposition Maid, Catherine of La Rochelle,
who said she was inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried
money—though she never did—and then Joan accidentally broke the old,
old sword, and others said that her power was broken with it. Finally,
at the siege of Compiègne, held by the Duke of Burgundy, where she did
valiant service, she was basely left alone in a retreat, though facing
about and fighting to the last; and an archer pulled her off her horse.

‘Why not?’

“What is the matter?” asked the visitor again.

Of these, the first may have been that her son had never signified the
smallest intention to ask her consent, or any mistrust of his ability
to dispense with it; the second, that the pension bestowed upon her by a
grateful country (and a Barnacle) would be freed from any little filial
inroads, when her Henry should be married to the darling only child of
a man in very easy circumstances; the third, that Henry’s debts must
clearly be paid down upon the altar-railing by his father-in-law. When,
to these three-fold points of prudence there is added the fact that
Mrs Gowan yielded her consent the moment she knew of Mr Meagles having
yielded his, and that Mr Meagles’s objection to the marriage had
been the sole obstacle in its way all along, it becomes the height of
probability that the relict of the deceased Commissioner of nothing
particular, turned these ideas in her sagacious mind.

Mr Rokesmith, who was at the wheel adjusting the skirts of her dress,
suddenly looked behind him, and around him, and then looked up at her,
with a face so pale that Mrs Boffin cried:

Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries
at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like
a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or
why we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the
flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her
garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.

“Greenland. Is Fagin up stairs?”

“Nancy!” cried Oliver, “What is it?”

"She makes me uneasy," said Susan to her husband; "at times I almost
fancy her cracked."

‘Mr Chuzzlewit wrote to her father; I mean the father of the poor thing
who’s his wife,’ said Chuffey; ‘and got him to come up, intending to
hasten on the marriage. But his mind, like mine, went a little wrong
through grief, and then his heart broke. He sank and altered from the
time when he came to me in the night; and never held up his head again.
It was only a few days, but he had never changed so much in twice the
years. “Spare him, Chuff!” he said, before he died. They were the only
words he could speak. “Spare him, Chuff!” I promised him I would. I’ve
tried to do it. He’s his only son.’

"Did she tell you why?" I inquired.

‘Do I go, sir?’ he at length asked in a low voice.

‘Well then,’ said Perker, rising and pushing his chair back, ‘my advice
is, that you both walk away together, or ride away, or get away by some
means or other, for I’m tired of you, and just talk this matter over
between you. If you have not settled it by the next time I see you, I’ll
tell you what to do.’

‘Over-driv the cab, and driv over a ’ooman,’ replied the top-boots,
with brevity.

‘Not a bit of it,’ replied Bob; ‘only cheerful.’

"Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you."

The house inspected, emissaries removed the Inexhaustible, who was
shortly afterwards heard screaming among the rainbows; whereupon Bella
withdrew herself from the presence and knowledge of gemplemorums, and
the screaming ceased, and smiling Peace associated herself with that
young olive branch.

Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly
thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of
some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It
fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely
audible splash; and was gone.

"Won't you come up here?"

Mr. Bolton took a very long draught of porter, and some two or three
dozen whiffs of tobacco, doubtless to instil into the commercial
capacities of the company the superiority of a gentlemen connected with
the press, and then said—

"Father!" said Minnie, playfully. "What a porpoise you do grow!"

The Secretary smiled with some bitterness, as though he would have said,
‘So I see and hear.’

"Gentleman in the coffee-room, sir," replied the Boots, as Mr. Winkle
opened the door and confronted him; "gentleman says he'll not detain
you a moment, sir, but he can take no denial."

[Sidenote: Mr. W. C. Macready.]

I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what
with soap-suds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. But
they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the
questions as to why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham's, and
what on earth I was expected to play at.

‘How am I?’ answered Hugh. ‘Where were you yesterday? Where did you go
when you left me in the jail? Why did you leave me? And what did you
mean by rolling your eyes and shaking your fist at me, eh?’

‘I can’t well lose what I have never had,’ retorted the medical student,
with a harsh, mocking laugh.

“Philip!” said Redlaw, laying his hand upon his arm, “I am a stricken
man, on whom the hand of Providence has fallen heavily, although
deservedly. You speak to me, my friend, of what I cannot follow; my
memory is gone.”

‘What do you call this, sir?’ demanded the schoolmaster, administering a
cut with the cane to expedite the reply.

“Oh yes, I understand—perfectly,” replied Fagin, telling the truth for
once. “Good-night! Good-night!”

Perker gave the fire another very unnecessary poke, and said, ‘I am
afraid so.’

CHAPTER 1.

Just consider what life would be, if every rogue was found out, and
flogged coram populo!  What a butchery, what an indecency, what an
endless swishing of the rod!  Don't cry out about my misanthropy.
My good friend Mealymouth, I will trouble you to tell me, do you go
to church?  When there, do you say, or do you not, that you are a
miserable sinner, and saying so do you believe or disbelieve it?
If you are a M. S., don't you deserve correction, and aren't you
grateful if you are to be let off?  I say again what a blessed
thing it is that we are not all found out!

“Reverend Mr. Septimus? Glad to see you, sir. Neville and Helena are
inside. Having a little succumbed of late, under the pressure of my
public labours, I thought I would take a mouthful of fresh air, and
come down with them, and return at night. So you are the Reverend Mr.
Septimus, are you?” surveying him on the whole with disappointment, and
twisting a double eye-glass by its ribbon, as if he were roasting it,
but not otherwise using it. “Hah! I expected to see you older, sir.”

‘Ah! we must take care of ourselves;—we must, indeed,’ said the
obsequious Wosky, as he felt the pulse of his interesting patient.

"Mr. Sawyer! Mr. Sawyer!" screamed a voice from the two-pair landing.

I said that Ma had said afterwards (and so she had), that great-uncle
Chopper's gift was a shabby one; but she hadn't said a bad one. She had
called it shabby, electrotyped, second-hand, and below his income.

His comrade Grip, the partner of his watch, though fond of basking in
the sunshine, preferred to-day to walk about the stable; having a great
deal to do in the way of scattering the straw, hiding under it such
small articles as had been casually left about, and haunting Hugh’s
bed, to which he seemed to have taken a particular attachment. Sometimes
Barnaby looked in and called him, and then he came hopping out; but
he merely did this as a concession to his master’s weakness, and soon
returned again to his own grave pursuits: peering into the straw with
his bill, and rapidly covering up the place, as if, Midas-like, he were
whispering secrets to the earth and burying them; constantly busying
himself upon the sly; and affecting, whenever Barnaby came past, to
look up in the clouds and have nothing whatever on his mind: in short,
conducting himself, in many respects, in a more than usually thoughtful,
deep, and mysterious manner.

Arrested by Town-Major Sirr on the 25th of August, a special commission
was immediately issued, Lord Norbury presiding. The evidence was clear,
decisive, and direct, and went over and unmistakably proved the facts as
already described.

‘You dine early, sir,’ said the powdered-headed footman.

‘To-morrow morning.’

‘A place to live, and learn to live, and gather health of mind and body
in,’ said the schoolmaster; ‘for this old house is yours.’

"Have you got a fire down-stairs?" said Dick.

They were off now; and Todgers’s was alone again. The two young ladies,
leaning back in their separate corners, resigned themselves to their
own regretful thoughts. But Mr Pecksniff, dismissing all ephemeral
considerations of social pleasure and enjoyment, concentrated his
meditations on the one great virtuous purpose before him, of casting
out that ingrate and deceiver, whose presence yet troubled his domestic
hearth, and was a sacrilege upon the altars of his household gods.

“Kate, Mary, Charlotte,--bride, matron, and dame in one, to whom I
have been wedded this half-century,--for I have had no other wife,
George,--God bless you, dear old heart! We have had a merry Christmas,
as we have ever had, and I trust it may be permitted to us to have,
still together, one more happy New Year. Hip! hip! hip! Hurrah!” and
the echoes of our three times three seemed cheerily to roam all night
about Tremadyn House.

Mr. Bucket looks very grave. Volumnia remarks of the deceased that he
was the trustiest and dearest person!

‘I think, Mas’r Davy, I know wheer to look.’

It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his
doubts of this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed
into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that
while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew
older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke
of it until they left a children's Twelfth-Night party, when, looking
at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that
its hair was gray.

"Would you?" she answered, with a quiet smile.

"Yo--yo--yo--yoe!" went the second.

‘Please, Mister Sawyer, Missis Raddle wants to speak to you.’

Tom refreshed himself at the Feathers, kept in those days by a man named
Jerry Mulvany, who was supposed to be more nearly connected with the
family of Ormond than the rites of the church could allow; and having
swallowed as much of the substantial food and the pestiferous fluid that
mine host of the Feathers tendered him, the spirit of inquisitiveness,
which, according to the phrenologists, is developed in all mankind,
seized paramount hold of Tom. Tom--? ay, Tom it must be, for I really
cannot recollect his other name.

‘Take care, Sir,’ said Dodson, who, though he was the biggest man of the
party, had prudently entrenched himself behind Fogg, and was speaking
over his head with a very pale face. ‘Let him assault you, Mr. Fogg;
don’t return it on any account.’

“An hour this side of midnight,” said Sikes, raising the blind to look
out, and returning to his seat. “Dark and heavy it is too. A good night
for business this.”

What a good fellow Elliotson is. He kept him in his room a whole hour,
and has gone into his case as if he were Prince Albert; laying down all
manner of elaborate projects and determining to leave his friend Wood in
town when he himself goes away, on purpose to attend to him. Then he
writes me four sides of paper about the man, and says he can't go back
to his old work, for that requires muscular exertion (and muscular
exertion he mustn't make), what are we to do with him? He says: "Here's
five pounds for the present."

“About a year and a half ago,” says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, “he
came into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my
little woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation)
in our shop, produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to
understand that he was in want of copying work to do and was, not to
put too fine a point upon it,” a favourite apology for plain speaking
with Mr. Snagsby, which he always offers with a sort of argumentative
frankness, “hard up! My little woman is not in general partial to
strangers, particular—not to put too fine a point upon it—when they
want anything. But she was rather took by something about this
person, whether by his being unshaved, or by his hair being in want
of attention, or by what other ladies’ reasons, I leave you to judge;
and she accepted of the specimen, and likewise of the address. My
little woman hasn’t a good ear for names,” proceeds Mr. Snagsby after
consulting his cough of consideration behind his hand, “and she
considered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod. In consequence of which,
she got into a habit of saying to me at meals, ‘Mr. Snagsby, you
haven’t found Nimrod any work yet!’ or ‘Mr. Snagsby, why didn’t you
give that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?’ or
such like. And that is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our
place; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick
hand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him
out, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have
it brought in on the Thursday morning. All of which—” Mr. Snagsby
concludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed, as much
as to add, “I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he
were in a condition to do it.”

‘And you made no effort to detain him?’ said Mr Haredale quickly.

Here Mr. Guppy’s mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling
her head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her.

"What's to be done?" said Mr. Pickwick, looking at the bottle. "This
proceeding is more absurd than the other."

“God bless you, Susan; dearest Susan! If you ever can bear witness to
the love I have for Walter, and the reason that I have to love him, do
it for his sake. Good-bye! Good-bye!”

"I know it's like me!" she exclaimed. "I know that I belong to it. I
know that it's the natural company of such as I am! It comes from
country places, where there was once no harm in it--and it creeps
through the dismal streets, defiled and miserable--and it goes away,
like my life, to a great sea, that is always troubled--and I feel that I
must go with it!"

‘We have remarked lately, Alfred, that the old man is turning very
suspicious and distrustful.’

‘No.’

The agreement was signed on the following day, to the indignation of old
Marguerite, and the mutual satisfaction of the parties concerned.

‘Our caution!’ returned the lawyer, ‘speaking for Self and
Craggs—deceased,’ here Mr. Snitchey, glancing at his hat-band, shook his
head, ‘how can you reasonably blame us, Mr. Warden?  It was understood
between us that the subject was never to be renewed, and that it wasn’t a
subject on which grave and sober men like us (I made a note of your
observations at the time) could interfere.  Our caution too!  When Mr.
Craggs, sir, went down to his respected grave in the full belief—’

The first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this,--I had
heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life
by reporting the debates in Parliament. Traddles having mentioned
newspapers to me, as one of his hopes, I had put the two things
together, and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I
could qualify myself for this pursuit. Traddles now informed me, as the
result of his inquiries, that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary,
except in rare cases, for thorough excellence in it, that is to say,
a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and
reading, was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages;
and that it might perhaps be attained, by dint of perseverance, in the
course of a few years. Traddles reasonably supposed that this would
settle the business; but I, only feeling that here indeed were a few
tall trees to be hewn down, immediately resolved to work my way on to
Dora through this thicket, axe in hand.

‘“Father,” urged the maiden, pausing, as did each of the others, in
her busy task, “we have prayed at matins, our daily alms have been
distributed at the gate, the sick peasants have been tended,--all our
morning tasks have been performed. I hope our occupation is a blameless
one?’

Mrs Prig, looking steadfastly at her friend, put her hand in her
pocket, and with an air of surly triumph drew forth either the oldest of
lettuces or youngest of cabbages, but at any rate, a green vegetable of
an expansive nature, and of such magnificent proportions that she was
obliged to shut it up like an umbrella before she could pull it out.
She also produced a handful of mustard and cress, a trifle of the herb
called dandelion, three bunches of radishes, an onion rather larger than
an average turnip, three substantial slices of beetroot, and a short
prong or antler of celery; the whole of this garden-stuff having been
publicly exhibited, but a short time before, as a twopenny salad, and
purchased by Mrs Prig on condition that the vendor could get it all into
her pocket. Which had been happily accomplished, in High Holborn, to
the breathless interest of a hackney-coach stand. And she laid so little
stress on this surprising forethought, that she did not even smile, but
returning her pocket into its accustomed sphere, merely recommended
that these productions of nature should be sliced up, for immediate
consumption, in plenty of vinegar.

The Italian state of things is not regarded as looking very cheerful.
What from one's natural sympathies with a people so oppressed as the
Italians, and one's natural antagonism to a pope and a Bourbon (both of
which superstitions I do suppose the world to have had more than enough
of), I agree with you concerning Victor Emmanuel, and greatly fear that
the Southern Italians are much degraded. Still, an united Italy would be
of vast importance to the peace of the world, and would be a rock in
Louis Napoleon's way, as he very well knows. Therefore the idea must be
championed, however much against hope.

No sooner was the bishop safely located upon the verdant down by the
reverential feelings of the awe-struck Velocipede, than the castle's
drawbridge fell, and an aged seneschal, of rubicund-tinted face, with
at least fifty liveried lackeys in fanciful suits, ran to assist the
bishop, and help him to regain his legs.

_Oh! hungry bards might dally

"My father showed me some letters from our ambassador to my elder
sister, in which he spoke of both of them in terms of the highest
esteem. I read these letters. They gave me courage; and my father's
phrase, 'They are your sisters as well as the others,' had sunk into my
heart. 'Console yourself,' I said to him, 'I am going to adopt a course
that may surprise you; but it appears to me the surest and the most
prudent. My eldest sister mentions several respectable persons in Paris
who can give testimony to the good conduct and virtue of her sister. I
will see them; and if their testimony is as honourable as that of our
ambassador, I shall instantly set out for Madrid, and either punish the
traitor who has outraged them, or bring them back with me to share my
humble fortune.'

‘Are you any better this morning, mother?’

"I hope it wasn't the boat that----"

‘I am convinced, my dear Amy,’ said Mr Sparkler, ‘that if ever there
was a girl, next to your highly endowed and beautiful sister, who had no
nonsense about her--’

But the Nipper, though susceptible of womanly weaknesses, was almost as
capable of putting constraint upon herself as of attacking the
redoubtable MacStinger. From that time, she never returned to the
subject, but was always cheerful, active, bustling, and hopeful. She
did, indeed, inform Mr Toots privately, that she was only “keeping up”
for the time, and that when it was all over, and Miss Dombey was gone,
she might be expected to become a spectacle distressful; and Mr Toots
did also express that it was his case too, and that they would mingle
their tears together; but she never otherwise indulged her private
feelings in the presence of Florence or within the precincts of the
Midshipman.

Colonel Basil Jackson, who in 1815 was a lieutenant in the Royal Staff
Corps, attached to the Quartermaster-General's department (see
Dalton's _Waterloo Roll Call_, p. 38), gives the following interesting
reminiscences of De Lancey on the 17th, at Quatre Bras, and during the
retreat to Waterloo on the same day: "Some few changes were made in
the disposition of the troops after the Duke of Wellington arrived on
the ground, soon after daylight; arms were then piled, and the men,
still wearied with their exertions of marching and fighting on the
preceding day, lay down to snatch a little more rest. The Duke, too,
after riding about and satisfying himself that all was as it should
be, dismounted and stretched himself on the ground, very near the
point where the road from Brussels to Charleroi crossed that leading
from Nivelles to Namur, forming thereby the _Quatre Bras_....

"Where is the regiment? What has happened? Let me call you mother. What
has happened, mother?"

This would seem to be a poetical note of preparation, agreed upon, as a
caution to Durdles to stand clear if he can, or to betake himself
homeward.

‘A charming girl, sir,’ murmured Mr Pecksniff, seeing that he waited
for an answer. ‘A dear girl, Mr Chuzzlewit, though I say it, who should
not.’

She knew not what she dreaded, or what hoped; but remained there,
motionless, looking at the porch by which they had disappeared.

“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Estella help it?”

‘When she was--lost,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘I know’d in my mind, as he
would take her to them countries. I know’d in my mind, as he’d have told
her wonders of ‘em, and how she was to be a lady theer, and how he got
her to listen to him fust, along o’ sech like. When we see his mother,
I know’d quite well as I was right. I went across-channel to France, and
landed theer, as if I’d fell down from the sky.’

This gentleman’s name, by the way, had been originally Crimp; but as
the word was susceptible of an awkward construction and might be
misrepresented, he had altered it to Crimple.

Mr. Swiveller and his partner played several rubbers with varying
success, until the loss of three sixpences, the gradual sinking of the
purl, and the striking of ten o'clock, combined to render that gentleman
mindful of the flight of time, and the wisdom of withdrawing before Mr.
Sampson and Miss Sally Brass returned.

DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _June 10th, 1841._

“Then I _don’t_ like that, and so I tell you plainly,” Rosa pouts.

All people who have been behind the scenes, and most people who have
been before them, know, that in the representation of a pantomime, a
good many men are sent upon the stage for the express purpose of being
cheated, or knocked down, or both. Now, down to a moment ago, we had
never been able to understand for what possible purpose a great number
of odd, lazy, large-headed men, whom one is in the habit of meeting
here, and there, and everywhere, could ever have been created. We see it
all, now. They are the supernumeraries in the pantomime of life; the men
who have been thrust into it, with no other view than to be constantly
tumbling over each other, and running their heads against all sorts of
strange things. We sat opposite to one of these men at a supper-table,
only last week. Now we think of it, he was exactly like the gentlemen
with the pasteboard heads and faces, who do the corresponding business
in the theatrical pantomimes; there was the same broad stolid
simper--the same dull leaden eye--the same unmeaning, vacant stare; and
whatever was said, or whatever was done, he always came in at precisely
the wrong place, or jostled against something that he had not the
slightest business with. We looked at the man across the table, again
and again; and could not satisfy ourselves what race of beings to class
him with. How very odd that this never occurred to us before!

‘Shall I go downstairs, sir?’ inquired Oliver.

Both his auditors assent.

The subject being once started, every one tarried to relate some
tale of midnight assassination; and all of them selected a strange
uninhabited dwelling as the scene of their agitating incidents. The
straw and half-opened packages which strewed the apartment gave the
place where they were congregated a cheerless aspect; and they were
excited to a degree of listening silence, and staring inquisitively at
one another, while John recounted how a lady of high respectability
chanced to be sitting by herself in the kitchen of a dilapidated
mansion about two hours after midnight, and looking thoughtfully, not
knowing what ailed her, at a round hole where a knot in the wainscot
had been thrust out, when she saw the large dark sparkling eye of a
most ferocious assassin peeping at her through the opening.

‘Dear Lord Peter!’ said Miss Julia, most winningly: putting her arm on
Mr. Trott’s shoulder. ‘Dear Lord Peter. Not a word?’

She smiled again.  ‘It is a happy home, Grace, in your fancy.  I can see
it in your eyes.  I know it _will_ be happy, dear.  How glad I am to know
it.’

‘I tell him so now.’

‘Wonderful man, Count Smorltork,’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter.

After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long
plunged, Oliver, urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which
seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die, got upon
his feet and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to
and fro like a drunken man; but he kept up nevertheless, and, with his
head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew
not whither.

His supreme contempt for his own limbs, as he sat smoking, was one of
the pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered.

The landlord had placed a light upon the table, and was engaged in
drawing the curtain of the window.  The speakers whom they had heard
were two men, who had a pack of cards and some silver money between
them, while upon the screen itself the games they had played were
scored in chalk.  The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of
middle age, with large black whiskers, broad cheeks, a coarse wide
mouth, and bull neck, which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt
collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief.  He wore his hat,
which was of a brownish-white, and had beside him a thick knotted
stick.  The other man, whom his companion had called Isaac, was of a
more slender figure--stooping, and high in the shoulders--with a very
ill-favoured face, and a most sinister and villainous squint.

“Ah! By-the-bye,” said Walter, stopping, “let me see; where are we? Oh!
I know. But the offices are shut up now, Miss Dombey. There’s nobody
there. Mr Dombey has gone home long ago. I suppose we must go home too?
or, stay. Suppose I take you to my Uncle’s, where I live—it’s very near
here—and go to your house in a coach to tell them you are safe, and
bring you back some clothes. Won’t that be best?”

‘Good night, sir.’

The watchfulness of his haggard look, and the inexplicable distrust that
darkened it, seemed to trouble Mr. Tetterby. He paused; and looking
fixedly at him in return, stood for a minute or so, like a man stupefied,
or fascinated.

‘Not sooner?’

‘There was a very snug little party, consisting of Maria Lobbs and her
cousin Kate, and three or four romping, good-humoured, rosy-cheeked
girls. Nathaniel Pipkin had ocular demonstration of the fact, that the
rumours of old Lobbs’s treasures were not exaggerated. There were the
real solid silver teapot, cream-ewer, and sugar-basin, on the table, and
real silver spoons to stir the tea with, and real china cups to drink it
out of, and plates of the same, to hold the cakes and toast in. The only
eye-sore in the whole place was another cousin of Maria Lobbs’s, and a
brother of Kate, whom Maria Lobbs called “Henry,” and who seemed to keep
Maria Lobbs all to himself, up in one corner of the table. It’s a
delightful thing to see affection in families, but it may be carried
rather too far, and Nathaniel Pipkin could not help thinking that Maria
Lobbs must be very particularly fond of her relations, if she paid as
much attention to all of them as to this individual cousin. After tea,
too, when the wicked little cousin proposed a game at blind man’s buff,
it somehow or other happened that Nathaniel Pipkin was nearly always
blind, and whenever he laid his hand upon the male cousin, he was sure
to find that Maria Lobbs was not far off. And though the wicked little
cousin and the other girls pinched him, and pulled his hair, and pushed
chairs in his way, and all sorts of things, Maria Lobbs never seemed to
come near him at all; and once--once--Nathaniel Pipkin could have sworn
he heard the sound of a kiss, followed by a faint remonstrance from
Maria Lobbs, and a half-suppressed laugh from her female friends. All
this was odd--very odd--and there is no saying what Nathaniel Pipkin
might or might not have done, in consequence, if his thoughts had not
been suddenly directed into a new channel.

"True," said the Ghost. "Your nephew!"

‘I’m sure he’d be highly flattered if he knew it,’ returned the other,
who was practising _l’été_.

"Mr. Peggotty," he said, "you are a thoroughly good fellow, and deserve
to be as happy as you are to-night. My hand upon it! Ham, I give you
joy, my boy. My hand upon that, too! Daisy, stir the fire, and make it a
brisk one! and Mr. Peggotty, unless you can induce your gentle niece to
come back (for whom I vacate this seat in the corner), I shall go. Any
gap at your fireside on such a night--such a gap least of all--I
wouldn't make, for the wealth of the Indies!"

But, how much beauty of another kind is here, when, on a fair clear
morning, we look, from the summit of a hill, on Florence!  See where it
lies before us in a sun-lighted valley, bright with the winding Arno, and
shut in by swelling hills; its domes, and towers, and palaces, rising
from the rich country in a glittering heap, and shining in the sun like
gold!

"That's all," said Mr. Snitchey, turning up the last paper. "Really
there's no other resource. No other resource."

So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the
spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what
he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter
up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far
above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their
mysterious conversation. He was on the point of emerging from his
hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound
of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his
ear.

‘A wery good imitation o’ one, if it ain’t,’ replied Mr. Weller.

‘Number three’s gone,’ said the first young lady. ‘Numbers eight and
eleven!’

"It's very unfortunate," said the stranger, with a sigh.

There are times, however, when his company is not so agreeable, though
equally unexpected; such as when the lady has invited one or two
particular friends to tea and scandal, and he happens to come home in
the very midst of their diversion. It is a hundred chances to one that
he remains in the house half an hour, but the lady is rather disturbed
by the intrusion, notwithstanding, and reasons within herself,—‘I am
sure I never interfere with him, and why should he interfere with me?
It can scarcely be accidental; it never happens that I have a
particular reason for not wishing him to come home, but he always
comes. It’s very provoking and tiresome; and I am sure when he leaves
me so much alone for his own pleasure, the least he could do would be
to do as much for mine.’ Observing what passes in her mind, the
gentleman, who has come home for his own accommodation, makes a merit
of it with himself; arrives at the conclusion that it is the very last
place in which he can hope to be comfortable; and determines, as he
takes up his hat and cane, never to be so virtuous again.

In the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me, when I
tried to get a better understanding of myself and be a better man, I
did glance, through some indefinite probation, to a period when I might
possibly hope to cancel the mistaken past, and to be so blessed as
to marry her. But, as time wore on, this shadowy prospect faded, and
departed from me. If she had ever loved me, then, I should hold her
the more sacred; remembering the confidences I had reposed in her, her
knowledge of my errant heart, the sacrifice she must have made to be my
friend and sister, and the victory she had won. If she had never loved
me, could I believe that she would love me now?

‘What else, if I had been so happy as to win her affections and possess
her heart?’

The Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different
cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being
taken back.

CHAPTER XXVIII-ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH PART THE SECOND

‘Do YOU ever go there, Mrs. Barkis?’

Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly
awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking,
when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and
yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you,
than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your
senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal
knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering
conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and
spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its
corporeal associate.

‘Let me look at him,’ returned Wrayburn, coolly. ‘Oh, yes, yes. I
recollect him!’

"To cancel your articles, Copperfield? Cancel?"

Martin was so amazed, so shocked, and confounded by what he had heard
that it was some time before he could reduce it to any order in his
mind, or could sufficiently comprehend the bearing of one part upon
another, to take in all the details at one view. When he, at length, had
the whole narrative clearly before him, John Westlock went on to point
out the great probability of the guilt of Jonas being known to other
people, who traded in it for their own benefit, and who were, by
such means, able to exert that control over him which Tom Pinch had
accidentally witnessed, and unconsciously assisted. This appeared so
plain, that they agreed upon it without difficulty; but instead of
deriving the least assistance from this source, they found that it
embarrassed them the more.

CHAPTER XIII-ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE FIRST, CALLED THE LION-HEART

As we swung open the last field-gate and entered the Allotment-grounds,
many members were already on their way to the Club, which stands in the
midst of the allotments.  Who could help thinking of the wonderful
contrast between these club-men and the club-men of St. James’s Street,
or Pall Mall, in London!  Look at yonder prematurely old man, doubled up
with work, and leaning on a rude stick more crooked than himself, slowly
trudging to the club-house, in a shapeless hat like an Italian
harlequin’s, or an old brown-paper bag, leathern leggings, and dull green
smock-frock, looking as though duck-weed had accumulated on it—the result
of its stagnant life—or as if it were a vegetable production, originally
meant to blow into something better, but stopped somehow.  Compare him
with Old Cousin Feenix, ambling along St. James’s Street, got up in the
style of a couple of generations ago, and with a head of hair, a
complexion, and a set of teeth, profoundly impossible to be believed in
by the widest stretch of human credulity.  Can they both be men and
brothers?  Verily they are.  And although Cousin Feenix has lived so fast
that he will die at Baden-Baden, and although this club-man in the frock
has lived, ever since he came to man’s estate, on nine shillings a week,
and is sure to die in the Union if he die in bed, yet he brought as much
into the world as Cousin Feenix, and will take as much out—more, for more
of him is real.

‘There, my dear,’ said Fagin. ‘That’s a pleasant life, isn’t it?
They have gone out for the day.’

‘I shall be very quiet, father.’

CHAPTER VII -- OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY

“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
mended as to feel that.”

[Picture: Automaton Police Office, and Real Offenders]

‘These five sisters were all of surpassing beauty. The eldest was in her
twenty-third year, the second a year younger, the third a year younger
than the second, and the fourth a year younger than the third. They were
tall stately figures, with dark flashing eyes and hair of jet; dignity
and grace were in their every movement; and the fame of their great
beauty had spread through all the country round.

"Never mind me, my dear," said the old lady; "I'm only having a
regular good cry. There, it's all over now, and I'm quite comfortable."

He did so, very soon. And such a fight King Harold led against that
force, that his brother, and the Norwegian King, and every chief of
note in all their host, except the Norwegian King’s son, Olave, to whom
he gave honourable dismissal, were left dead upon the field. The
victorious army marched to York. As King Harold sat there at the feast,
in the midst of all his company, a stir was heard at the doors; and
messengers all covered with mire from riding far and fast through
broken ground came hurrying in, to report that the Normans had landed
in England.

‘Oh my head!’ cried the dolls’ dressmaker, holding it with both her
hands, as if it were cracking. ‘You can’t mean what you say.’

‘Where will you go, Stephen?’

There was so much to say up-stairs, and there were so many plans
to concert for elopement and matrimony in the event of old Wardle
continuing to be cruel, that it wanted only half an hour of dinner when
Mr. Snodgrass took his final adieu. The ladies ran to Emily's bedroom
to dress, and the lover, taking up his hat, walked out of the room.
He had scarcely got outside the door, when he heard Wardle's voice
talking loudly, and looking over the banisters, beheld him, followed
by some other gentlemen, coming straight up-stairs. Knowing nothing of
the house, Mr. Snodgrass in his confusion stepped hastily back into
the room he had just quitted, and passing from thence into an inner
apartment (Mr. Wardle's bed-chamber), closed the door softly, just as
the persons he had caught a glimpse of entered the sitting-room. These
were Mr. Wardle, Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, and Mr. Benjamin
Allen, whom he had no difficulty in recognising by their voices.

The tobacco business round the corner of Horsemonger Lane was carried
out in a rural establishment one story high, which had the benefit of
the air from the yards of Horsemonger Lane jail, and the advantage of a
retired walk under the wall of that pleasant establishment. The business
was of too modest a character to support a life-size Highlander, but it
maintained a little one on a bracket on the door-post, who looked like
a fallen Cherub that had found it necessary to take to a kilt.

Taking notice of Pleasant Riderhood at the door, the man crossed so
quickly that she was still winding herself up, when he stood close
before her.

As to our nightly life, the contagion of suspicion and fear was
among us, and there is no such contagion under the sky.  Hooded
woman?  According to the accounts, we were in a perfect Convent of
hooded women.  Noises?  With that contagion downstairs, I myself
have sat in the dismal parlor, listening, until I have heard so
many and such strange noises, that they would have chilled my blood
if I had not warmed it by dashing out to make discoveries.  Try
this in bed, in the dead of the night: try this at your own
comfortable fire-side, in the life of the night.  You can fill any
house with noises, if you will, until you have a noise for every
nerve in your nervous system.

Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they
were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers
passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the
way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made
plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was
Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted
up.

"I know a gen'l'man, sir," said Mr. Weller, "as did that, and begun at
two yards; but he never tried it on agin; for he blowed the bird right
clean away at the first fire, and nobody ever seed a feather on him
arterwards."

‘Then,’ pursued the hostess--and it really was not an unnatural
inquiry--‘why do you desert it?’

With this stipulation, Mrs. Nickleby, who was troubled, night and day,
with a vision of a hot messenger tearing up to the door to announce that
Nicholas had been taken into partnership, quitted that branch of the
subject, and entered upon a new one.

Not a word had been said to the young gentlemen, nor a hint dropped, of
anything like a contemplated marriage between Mr Feeder, B.A., and the
fair Cornelia Blimber. Doctor Blimber, especially, seemed to take pains
to look as if nothing would surprise him more; but it was perfectly
well known to all the young gentlemen nevertheless, and when they
departed for the society of their relations and friends, they took
leave of Mr Feeder with awe.

‘Shall we turn back, or run into a cottage?’ asked Miss Price. ‘He don’t
see us yet.’

It may have been that Mrs Lammle tried in some manner to excuse her
conduct to herself by depreciating the poor little victim of whom she
spoke with acrimonious contempt. It may have been too that in this she
did not quite succeed, for it is very difficult to resist confidence,
and she knew she had Georgiana’s.

Veneering loses his way in the usual No Thoroughfares of speech, and
Podsnap and Twemlow say Hear hear! and sometimes, when he can’t by any
means back himself out of some very unlucky No Thoroughfare, ‘He-a-a-r
He-a-a-r!’ with an air of facetious conviction, as if the ingenuity of
the thing gave them a sensation of exquisite pleasure. But Veneering
makes two remarkably good points; so good, that they are supposed
to have been suggested to him by the legal gentleman in Britannia’s
confidence, while briefly conferring on the stairs.

‘I know it,’ replied his companion, ‘and I see you are impatient.  But
look.  Through the eastern window—placed opposite to us, that the first
beams of the rising sun may every morning gild our giant faces—the
moon-rays fall upon the pavement in a stream of light that to my fancy
sinks through the cold stone and gushes into the old crypt below.  The
night is scarcely past its noon, and our great charge is sleeping
heavily.’

‘You will be sure to come?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.

‘Oh, Miss Wilfer, this is hardly charitable. I ask you nothing but what
your own emphasis suggests. However, I waive even that question. But
what I have declared, I take my stand by. I cannot recall the avowal of
my earnest and deep attachment to you, and I do not recall it.’

The Pirates were so close upon us at this time, that the foremost of them
were already before the gate.  More and more came up with a great noise,
and shouting loudly.  When we believed from the sound that they were all
there, we gave three English cheers.  The poor little children joined,
and were so fully convinced of our being at play, that they enjoyed the
noise, and were heard clapping their hands in the silence that followed.

After this, he walked and walked until his feet were all blistered;
and, having been concealed all one day in a house which was searched by
the troopers while he was there, went with Lord Wilmot, another of his
good friends, to a place called Bentley, where one Miss Lane, a
Protestant lady, had obtained a pass to be allowed to ride through the
guards to see a relation of hers near Bristol. Disguised as a servant,
he rode in the saddle before this young lady to the house of Sir John
Winter, while Lord Wilmot rode there boldly, like a plain country
gentleman, with dogs at his heels. It happened that Sir John Winter’s
butler had been servant in Richmond Palace, and knew Charles the moment
he set eyes upon him; but, the butler was faithful and kept the secret.
As no ship could be found to carry him abroad, it was planned that he
should go—still travelling with Miss Lane as her servant—to another
house, at Trent near Sherborne in Dorsetshire; and then Miss Lane and
her cousin, Mr. Lascelles, who had gone on horseback beside her all the
way, went home. I hope Miss Lane was going to marry that cousin, for I
am sure she must have been a brave, kind girl. If I had been that
cousin, I should certainly have loved Miss Lane.

"Beautiful indeed," echoed a red-haired man with an inquisitive nose
and blue spectacles, who had unpacked himself from a cab at the same
moment as Mr. Pickwick. "Going to Ipswich, sir?"

"Yes, sir."

Mr. Pickwick, having with many blushes placed in my hands a small roll of
paper, which he termed his ‘qualification,’ put a great many questions to
me touching my friends, and particularly Jack Redburn, whom he repeatedly
termed ‘a fine fellow,’ and in whose favour I could see he was strongly
predisposed.  When I had satisfied him on these points, I took him up
into my room, that he might make acquaintance with the old chamber which
is our place of meeting.

A husband writes:

Oh! long, long afterwards, I saw that face rise up before me, with its
momentary look, not wondering, not accusing, not regretting. Oh, long,
long afterwards, I saw that look subside, as it did now, into the lovely
smile, with which she told me she had no fear for herself--I need have
none for her--and parted from me by the name of Brother, and was gone!

"The weight o' the pair, mum," said George, eyeing them carefully,
"would be a trifle under that of Oliver Cromwell."

‘And what’s your news, Mrs Gamp?’ asked Mould again, as that lady wiped
her lips upon her shawl, and nibbled a corner off a soft biscuit, which
she appeared to carry in her pocket as a provision against contingent
drams. ‘How’s Mr Chuffey?’

Therefore, as we grow older, let us be more thankful that the circle of
our Christmas associations and of the lessons that they bring, expands!
Let us welcome every one of them, and summon them to take their places by
the Christmas hearth.

“Doctor Blimber’s study, Ma’am,” was the reply.

‘That I call God to witness he has,’ said the woman, passionately;
‘pitilessly, inhumanly murdered!’

The day came, and the She-Wolf in the Capitol might have snarled with
envy to see how the Island Savages contrived these things now-a-days.
The murderous-headed statues of the wicked Emperors of the Soldiery,
whom sculptors had not been able to flatter out of their villainous
hideousness, might have come off their pedestals to run away with the
Bride. The choked old fountain, where erst the gladiators washed, might
have leaped into life again to honour the ceremony. The Temple of
Vesta might have sprung up anew from its ruins, expressly to lend its
countenance to the occasion. Might have done; but did not. Like sentient
things--even like the lords and ladies of creation sometimes--might
have done much, but did nothing. The celebration went off with admirable
pomp; monks in black robes, white robes, and russet robes stopped to
look after the carriages; wandering peasants in fleeces of sheep, begged
and piped under the house-windows; the English volunteers defiled; the
day wore on to the hour of vespers; the festival wore away; the thousand
churches rang their bells without any reference to it; and St Peter
denied that he had anything to do with it.

‘No offence, I hope, Mr. Weller,’ said Pell meekly. ‘You are the
executor, I see,’ he added, casting his eyes over the paper.

“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,
motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.

To this she returned, "Don't be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in."
And scornfully walked away, and--what was worse--took the candle with
her.

‘What is it?’ replied Nicholas.

Even then, though Thomas à Becket knelt before the King, he was
obstinate and immovable as to those words about his order. King Louis
of France was weak enough in his veneration for Thomas à Becket and
such men, but this was a little too much for him. He said that à Becket
‘wanted to be greater than the saints and better than St. Peter,’ and
rode away from him with the King of England. His poor French Majesty
asked à Becket’s pardon for so doing, however, soon afterwards, and cut
a very pitiful figure.

‘When I am off this cursed bed,’ said the invalid, actually striking at
his broken leg in the ecstasy of his passion, ‘I’ll have such revenge as
never man had yet. By God, I will. Accident favouring him, he has marked
me for a week or two, but I’ll put a mark on him that he shall carry
to his grave. I’ll slit his nose and ears, flog him, maim him for life.
I’ll do more than that; I’ll drag that pattern of chastity, that pink of
prudery, the delicate sister, through--’

As Clennam said that it was his favourite way, he felt her hand falter
on his arm, and saw the roses shake.

“Now, I may say to your ladyship at once,” says Mr. Guppy, a little
emboldened, “it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce
that made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship, which conduct I
have no doubt did appear, and does appear, obtrusive—in fact, almost
blackguardly.”

"What are you crying for?" inquired the gentleman in the white
waistcoat; and to be sure it was very extraordinary. What _could_ he be
crying for?

‘--Bringing with him two women servants, and his steward, and a
gardener. The rest stopped behind up in London, and were to follow next
day. It happened that that night, an old gentleman who lived at Chigwell
Row, and had long been poorly, deceased, and an order came to me at half
after twelve o’clock at night to go and toll the passing-bell.’

"You don't find this sort of thing disagreeable, I hope, sir?" said his
right-hand neighbour, a gentleman in a checked shirt, and Mosaic studs,
with a cigar in his mouth.

‘Ah! Don’t be hard upon the Barnacles,’ said Gowan, laughing afresh,
‘they are darling fellows! Even poor little Clarence, the born idiot of
the family, is the most agreeable and most endearing blockhead! And by
Jupiter, with a kind of cleverness in him too that would astonish you!’

"There's one of us in every family."

‘No, sir. My brother-in-law, Tom, was her father.’

They both returned his greeting laughingly, and walked home arm-in-arm.
Mr Pinch imparting to his new friend, as they went, such further
particulars of Mark Tapley’s whimsical restlessness as the reader is
already acquainted with.

The Uncommercial took the liberty of hinting that he hardly thought it
probable that any lady or gentleman in want of a likely young domestic of
retiring manners, would be tempted into the engagement of either of the
two leading Refractories, on her own presentation of herself as per
sample.

Mr. Micawber returned to the King's Bench when his case was over, as
some fees were to be settled, and some formalities observed, before he
could be actually released. The club received him with transport, and
held an harmonic meeting that evening in his honor; while Mrs. Micawber
and I had a lamb's fry in private, surrounded by the sleeping family.

‘I think,’ said Mrs. Britain, applying herself to her pockets and drawing
forth an immense bulk of thin books and crumpled papers: a very kennel of
dogs’-ears: ‘I’ve done everything.  Bills all settled—turnips
sold—brewer’s account looked into and paid—’bacco pipes ordered—seventeen
pound four, paid into the Bank—Doctor Heathfield’s charge for little
Clem—you’ll guess what that is—Doctor Heathfield won’t take nothing
again, Ben.’

"That since, by the blessing of Allah, it has come to the knowledge of
the asylum of the universe, the king of kings, that the good fortune
which accompanied the infidels of England has turned upon them, it has
appeared good to appoint some master of wit, some lord of understanding
and experience, to go, and see, and consider, and to endeavour to
extract advantage from misery, wealth from poverty, and instruction from
wickedness: to that effect, the high in station, Hajji Baba, famous for
his skill in Franc wisdom and language, the lord of accomplishment, the
skilled in cunning and intelligence, has been appointed to this service.

What a noble end and aim it was to contemplate in the attainment truly!
But there be some who manufacture idols after the fashion of themselves,
and fail to worship them when they are made; charging their deformity on
outraged nature. Anthony was better than these at any rate.

‘A skill in purwiding what he finds, perhaps,’ said Riderhood, shaking
his evil head.

He then quietly handed the pot to Ivan, who replaced it with the
gloves and the beard in the box; and after making an inquiry which
sounded like a growl, to which Bourgonef answered negatively, he
continued his packing.

It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end.

“That’s the journey you have been away upon,” she quietly remarks.

"Now, my dear Copperfield, in reference to this proposal of yours. It's
very gratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but don't you think you
could do better? You achieved distinction, you know, when you were with
us. You are qualified for many good things. You have laid a foundation
that any edifice may be raised upon; and is it not a pity that you
should devote the spring-time of your life to such a poor pursuit as I
can offer?"

Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and
dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is
thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst
not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious.
It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it
is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open,
generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a
man's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from
the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!

‘Here’s the gentleman you want,’ said Ikey, abruptly breaking off in
his story, and introducing Mr. Gabriel Parsons to the crest-fallen
Watkins Tottle, who at that moment entered the room. Watkins advanced
with a wooden expression of passive endurance, and accepted the hand
which Mr. Gabriel Parsons held out.

‘Let us go on,’ said the younger brother, ‘and leave this good fellow
to wake them, if he can.  I cannot rest until I know that we are not
too late.  Let us go on, in the name of Heaven!’

“I am afraid,” said Mr Dombey, interrupting her testily, “that some of
those persons upstairs suggest improper subjects to the child. He was
speaking to me last night about his—about his Bones,” said Mr Dombey,
laying an irritated stress upon the word. “What on earth has anybody to
do with the—with the—Bones of my son? He is not a living skeleton, I
suppose.”

“My dear Dame Durden,” said Allan, drawing my arm through his, “do
you ever look in the glass?”

He pushed away his empty plate; and with a second mug upon the hearth
before him, looked thoughtfully at the fire until his eyes ached. Then
he looked at the highly-coloured scripture pieces on the walls, in
little black frames like common shaving-glasses, and saw how the Wise
Men (with a strong family likeness among them) worshipped in a pink
manger; and how the Prodigal Son came home in red rags to a purple
father, and already feasted his imagination on a sea-green calf. Then he
glanced through the window at the falling rain, coming down aslant upon
the sign-post over against the house, and overflowing the horse-trough;
and then he looked at the fire again, and seemed to descry a double
distant London, retreating among the fragments of the burning wood.

"Nettie and I," said Alice, mournfully, "have been considering our
position. The grown-up people are too strong for us. They make us
ridiculous. Besides, they have changed the times. William Tinkling's
baby-brother was christened yesterday. What took place? Was any king
present? Answer, William."

The orderly officer for the day--we speak of the subaltern--was supposed
to go through a great deal. His duty it was to assist at inspections,
superintend drills, examine the soldiers’ provisions, see their
breakfasts and dinners served, and attend to any complaints, visit the
regimental guards by day and night, be present at all parades and
musters, and, finally, deliver in a written report of the proceedings of
the four-and-twenty hours.

Much vexed by this reflection, Mr. Squeers looked at the little boy to
see whether he was doing anything he could beat him for. As he happened
not to be doing anything at all, he merely boxed his ears, and told him
not to do it again.

He made as if he were going away; and indeed he did feel he would rather
think it over in quiet. But Susan, grieved at her incautious words,
which had all the appearance of harshness, went a step or two
nearer--paused--and then, all over blushes, said in a low soft whisper--

“And he never does anything else,” said the old lady of the
censorious countenance. “Yet would you believe that it’s HIS name on
the door-plate?”

"Perhaps not, and yet may have enough to be afraid of too," he answered.
"Well! So it goes by! I am not about to be hipped again, David; but I
tell you, my good fellow, once more, that it would have been well for me
(and for more than me) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father!"

“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I
cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may
tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”

‘I won’t,’ said the military gentleman.

Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually
followed the directions he had received, which—Master Bates being
pretty well acquainted with the locality—were so exact that he was
enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question,
or meeting with any interruption by the way.

FURTHER CONTINUATION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND

"Monsieur Theophile, I believe?" said the Englishman to the Corporal.

Barbara was touched, and sorry to have appeared indifferent.

The knowledge came upon me, not quickly, but little by little, and grain
by grain. The desolate feeling with which I went abroad, deepened
and widened hourly. At first it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow,
wherein I could distinguish little else. By imperceptible degrees,
it became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost--love,
friendship, interest; of all that had been shattered--my first trust,
my first affection, the whole airy castle of my life; of all that
remained--a ruined blank and waste, lying wide around me, unbroken, to
the dark horizon.

‘I should like to have a word with you,’ said Ralph, who had both
spoken and listened mechanically for some time, and seemed to have been
thinking.

‘I believe I have a little note here, which I was to give to you
whenever I found you. This is it. Unless I greatly mistake, it is
addressed to you? Is it not?’

CHAPTER XXXIII-ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST

"Sir?"

"No; it ain't 'damned,'" observed Sam, holding the letter up to the
light, "it's 'shamed,' there's a blot there--'I feel myself ashamed.'"

‘She seems to make such game of one,’ replied Mr Jonas.

“I do,” said Drummle.

In unison with this pursuit, a chaste simplicity obtains in the domestic
habits of Arcadia.  Its few scattered people dine early, live moderately,
sup socially, and sleep soundly.  It is rumoured that the Beadles of the
Arcade, from being the mortal enemies of boys, have signed with tears an
address to Lord Shaftesbury, and subscribed to a ragged school.  No
wonder!  For, they might turn their heavy maces into crooks and tend
sheep in the Arcade, to the purling of the water-carts as they give the
thirsty streets much more to drink than they can carry.

Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary
idea of knocking Scrooge down with it; holding him; and calling to the
people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.

CHAPTER 58. ABSENCE

‘Oh, no, I didn’t,’ cried Georgiana. ‘It’s very impolite, I know, but
I came to see my poor Sophronia, my only friend. Oh! how I felt the
separation, my dear Sophronia, before I knew you were brought low in the
world, and how much more I feel it now!’

The next morning, betimes, Mr. Cripps placed himself under the hands
of Antoine, who proceeded to array him in a magnificent suit, which had
never been worn by his master, it having only been sent home the night
before by Desmartins.

In one large ward, sitting by the fire in arm-chairs of distinction, like
the President and Vice of the good company, were two old women, upwards
of ninety years of age.  The younger of the two, just turned ninety, was
deaf, but not very, and could easily be made to hear.  In her early time
she had nursed a child, who was now another old woman, more infirm than
herself, inhabiting the very same chamber.  She perfectly understood this
when the matron told it, and, with sundry nods and motions of her
forefinger, pointed out the woman in question.  The elder of this pair,
ninety-three, seated before an illustrated newspaper (but not reading
it), was a bright-eyed old soul, really not deaf, wonderfully preserved,
and amazingly conversational.  She had not long lost her husband, and had
been in that place little more than a year.  At Boston, in the State of
Massachusetts, this poor creature would have been individually addressed,
would have been tended in her own room, and would have had her life
gently assimilated to a comfortable life out of doors.  Would that be
much to do in England for a woman who has kept herself out of a workhouse
more than ninety rough long years?  When Britain first, at Heaven’s
command, arose, with a great deal of allegorical confusion, from out the
azure main, did her guardian angels positively forbid it in the Charter
which has been so much besung?

By morning’s cheerful glow, but oftener still by evening’s gentle
light, the child, with a respect for the short and happy intercourse of
these two sisters which forbade her to approach and say a thankful
word, although she yearned to do so, followed them at a distance in
their walks and rambles, stopping when they stopped, sitting on the
grass when they sat down, rising when they went on, and feeling it a
companionship and delight to be so near them.  Their evening walk was
by a river’s side.  Here, every night, the child was too, unseen by
them, unthought of, unregarded; but feeling as if they were her
friends, as if they had confidences and trusts together, as if her load
were lightened and less hard to bear; as if they mingled their sorrows,
and found mutual consolation.  It was a weak fancy perhaps, the
childish fancy of a young and lonely creature; but night after night,
and still the sisters loitered in the same place, and still the child
followed with a mild and softened heart.

The representatives of the Barnacle Chorus dropped in next, and Mr
Merdle’s physician dropped in next. Bar, who had a bit of one eye and a
bit of his double eye-glass for every one who came in at the door, no
matter with whom he was conversing or what he was talking about, got
among them all by some skilful means, without being seen to get at them,
and touched each individual gentleman of the jury on his own individual
favourite spot. With some of the Chorus, he laughed about the sleepy
member who had gone out into the lobby the other night, and voted the
wrong way: with others, he deplored that innovating spirit in the time
which could not even be prevented from taking an unnatural interest in
the public service and the public money: with the physician he had a
word to say about the general health; he had also a little information
to ask him for, concerning a professional man of unquestioned erudition
and polished manners--but those credentials in their highest development
he believed were the possession of other professors of the healing art
(jury droop)--whom he had happened to have in the witness-box the day
before yesterday, and from whom he had elicited in cross-examination
that he claimed to be one of the exponents of this new mode of treatment
which appeared to Bar to--eh?--well, Bar thought so; Bar had thought,
and hoped, Physician would tell him so. Without presuming to decide
where doctors disagreed, it did appear to Bar, viewing it as a question
of common sense and not of so-called legal penetration, that this new
system was--might be, in the presence of so great an authority--say,
Humbug? Ah! Fortified by such encouragement, he could venture to say
Humbug; and now Bar’s mind was relieved.

“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger species
of child, and as no more than my equal.

‘If the law supposes that,’ said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat
emphatically in both hands, ‘the law is a ass--a idiot. If that’s
the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the
law is, that his eye may be opened by experience--by experience.’

‘No.’

These orders and the way in which he ran about the yard urging them
caused a general excitement that was scarcely less bewildering to me
than the sudden change. But in the height of the confusion, a mounted
man galloped away to order the relays, and our horses were put to
with great speed.

‘Now,’ said Fagin, when they had left the room, ‘I’ll go and get you
that cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where
I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my
money, for I’ve got none to lock up, my dear--ha! ha! ha!--none to
lock up. It’s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I’m fond of
seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.
Hush!’ he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; ‘who’s
that? Listen!’

“Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value
in course of time,” answered the matron, still preserving the resolute
indifference she had assumed. “As to lying dead, there are those who
will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for
any thing you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!”

'This is Mr. Pickwick,' said the Serjeant, waving his pen in the
    direction in which that gentleman was standing.

‘Where’s her mother?’ asked that worthy gentleman.

Leaving it to pursue its journey at the pleasure of the conductor
aforementioned, who lounged gracefully on his little shelf behind,
smoking an odoriferous cigar; and leaving it to stop, or go on, or
gallop, or crawl, as that gentleman deemed expedient and advisable; this
narrative may embrace the opportunity of ascertaining the condition of
Sir Mulberry Hawk, and to what extent he had, by this time, recovered
from the injuries consequent on being flung violently from his
cabriolet, under the circumstances already detailed.

‘Aye, aye!  Years,’ said Mr. Tugby, ‘are like Christians in that respect.
Some of ’em die hard; some of ’em die easy.  This one hasn’t many days to
run, and is making a fight for it.  I like him all the better.  There’s a
customer, my love!’

"I'm sure I cannot say," said I.

And there it lay alone.  The sky was red with flame, and the water that
bore it there had been tinged with the sullen light as it flowed along.
The place the deserted carcass had left so recently, a living man, was
now a blazing ruin.  There was something of the glare upon its face.
The hair, stirred by the damp breeze, played in a kind of mockery of
death--such a mockery as the dead man himself would have delighted in
when alive--about its head, and its dress fluttered idly in the night
wind.

"Is she--?"

CHAPTER IX.

“If you please, sir,—you have been so good to little Ailsie—”

But at the time I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes, and could
not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together.  I begged Joe to be
comforted.  Joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist, as if he
were bent on gouging himself, but said not another word.

“For I am constantly being taken in these nets,” said Mr. Skimpole,
looking beamingly at us over a glass of wine-and-water, “and am
constantly being bailed out—like a boat. Or paid off—like a ship’s
company. Somebody always does it for me. I can’t do it, you know, for
I never have any money. But somebody does it. I get out by somebody’s
means; I am not like the starling; I get out. If you were to ask me
who somebody is, upon my word I couldn’t tell you. Let us drink to
somebody. God bless him!”

The fastenings jar and rattle, and one of the doors turns slowly on its
hinges.  Let us look in.  A small bare cell, into which the light enters
through a high chink in the wall.  There is a rude means of washing, a
table, and a bedstead.  Upon the latter, sits a man of sixty; reading.
He looks up for a moment; gives an impatient dogged shake; and fixes his
eyes upon his book again.  As we withdraw our heads, the door closes on
him, and is fastened as before.  This man has murdered his wife, and will
probably be hanged.

Jarber rose and put on his little cloak.  A couple of fierce brass lions
held it tight round his little throat; but a couple of the mildest Hares
might have done that, I am sure.  “Sarah,” he said, “I go.  Expect me on
Monday evening, the Sixth, when perhaps you will give me a cup of
tea;—may I ask for no Green?  Adieu!”

Mr Meagles asked, What kind of thing?

[Illustration: "OH, THANK YOU, MASTER COPPERFIELD," SAID URIAH HEEP,
"FOR THAT REMARK! IT IS SO TRUE! 'UMBLE AS I AM, I KNOW IT IS SO TRUE!
OH, THANK YOU, MASTER COPPERFIELD!"--Chap. xvi.]

‘As I think I told you once before,’ said I, ‘it is you who have been,
in your greed and cunning, against all the world. It may be profitable
to you to reflect, in future, that there never were greed and cunning in
the world yet, that did not do too much, and overreach themselves. It is
as certain as death.’

As I honour the two old funds for the great good which they have done, so
I honour this for the much greater good it is resolved to do.  It is not
because I love them less, but because I love this more—because it
includes more in its operation.

"Well, my dear Copperfield, _when_ I am one, I shall tell the story, as
I said I would."

The drawback was, that I was often sleepy at night, or out of spirits
and indisposed to resume the story; and then it was rather hard work,
and it must be done; for to disappoint or to displease Steerforth was of
course out of the question. In the morning, too, when I felt weary, and
should have enjoyed another hour’s repose very much, it was a tiresome
thing to be roused, like the Sultana Scheherazade, and forced into a
long story before the getting-up bell rang; but Steerforth was resolute;
and as he explained to me, in return, my sums and exercises, and
anything in my tasks that was too hard for me, I was no loser by the
transaction. Let me do myself justice, however. I was moved by no
interested or selfish motive, nor was I moved by fear of him. I admired
and loved him, and his approval was return enough. It was so precious to
me that I look back on these trifles, now, with an aching heart.

Thus had lived and flourished the Degs on their ancient patrimony, the
parish, for upwards of two hundred years. Nay, we have no doubt whatever
that, if it could have been traced, they had enjoyed an ancestry of
paupers as long as the pedigree of Sir Roger Rockville himself. In the
days of the most perfect villenage, they had, doubtless, eaten the bread
of idleness, and claimed it as a right. They were numerous, improvident,
ragged in dress, and fond of an ale-house and of gossip. Like the blood
of Sir Roger, their blood had become peculiar through a long persistence
of the same circumstances. It was become pure pauper blood. The Degs
married, if not entirely among Degs, yet among the same class. None but
a pauper would dream of marrying a Deg. The Degs, therefore, were in
constitution, in mind, in habit, and in inclination, paupers. But a pure
and unmixed class of this kind does not die out like an aristocratic
stereotype. It increases and multiplies. The lower the grade, the more
prolific, as is sometimes seen on a large and even national scale. The
Degs threatened, therefore, to become a most formidable clan in the
lower purlieus of Stockington, but luckily there is so much virtue even
in evils, that one, not rarely cures another. War, the great evil,
cleared the town of Degs.

‘Yes.’

My guardian intending to go back immediately, we appointed, on our
way down, a day when my dear girl should come. I wrote her a letter,
of which he took charge, and he left us within half an hour of our
arrival at our destination, on a delightful evening in the early
summer-time.

‘Therefore, I mentioned to them,’ said Mr. Omer, in a comfortable,
easy-going tone, ‘this. I said, “Now, don’t consider Em’ly nailed down
in point of time, at all. Make it your own time. Her services have been
more valuable than was supposed; her learning has been quicker than was
supposed; Omer and Joram can run their pen through what remains; and
she’s free when you wish. If she likes to make any little arrangement,
afterwards, in the way of doing any little thing for us at home,
very well. If she don’t, very well still. We’re no losers, anyhow.”
 For--don’t you see,’ said Mr. Omer, touching me with his pipe, ‘it ain’t
likely that a man so short of breath as myself, and a grandfather too,
would go and strain points with a little bit of a blue-eyed blossom,
like her?’

‘Is your heart mine still, dear Dora?’ said I, rapturously, for I knew
by her clinging to me that it was.

III.

‘Then I beg to announce to you my unalterable determination to pay no
damages whatever,’ said Mr. Pickwick, most emphatically. ‘None, Perker.
Not a pound, not a penny of my money, shall find its way into the
pockets of Dodson and Fogg. That is my deliberate and irrevocable
determination.’ Mr. Pickwick gave a heavy blow on the table before him,
in confirmation of the irrevocability of his intention.

“No,” replied the Dodger, “not here, for this ain’t the shop for
justice; besides which my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with
the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something
to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and
respectable circle of acquaintance as’ll make them beaks wish they’d
never been born, or that they’d got their footman to hang ’em up to
their own hat-pegs, ’afore they let ’em come out this morning to try it
upon me. I’ll——”

The first diabolical character who intruded himself on my peaceful youth
(as I called to mind that day at Dullborough), was a certain Captain
Murderer.  This wretch must have been an off-shoot of the Blue Beard
family, but I had no suspicion of the consanguinity in those times.  His
warning name would seem to have awakened no general prejudice against
him, for he was admitted into the best society and possessed immense
wealth.  Captain Murderer’s mission was matrimony, and the gratification
of a cannibal appetite with tender brides.  On his marriage morning, he
always caused both sides of the way to church to be planted with curious
flowers; and when his bride said, ‘Dear Captain Murderer, I ever saw
flowers like these before: what are they called?’ he answered, ‘They are
called Garnish for house-lamb,’ and laughed at his ferocious practical
joke in a horrid manner, disquieting the minds of the noble bridal
company, with a very sharp show of teeth, then displayed for the first
time.  He made love in a coach and six, and married in a coach and
twelve, and all his horses were milk-white horses with one red spot on
the back which he caused to be hidden by the harness.  For, the spot
_would_ come there, though every horse was milk-white when Captain
Murderer bought him.  And the spot was young bride’s blood.  (To this
terrific point I am indebted for my first personal experience of a
shudder and cold beads on the forehead.)  When Captain Murderer had made
an end of feasting and revelry, and had dismissed the noble guests, and
was alone with his wife on the day month after their marriage, it was his
whimsical custom to produce a golden rolling-pin and a silver pie-board.
Now, there was this special feature in the Captain’s courtships, that he
always asked if the young lady could make pie-crust; and if she couldn’t
by nature or education, she was taught.  Well.  When the bride saw
Captain Murderer produce the golden rolling-pin and silver pie-board, she
remembered this, and turned up her laced-silk sleeves to make a pie.  The
Captain brought out a silver pie-dish of immense capacity, and the
Captain brought out flour and butter and eggs and all things needful,
except the inside of the pie; of materials for the staple of the pie
itself, the Captain brought out none.  Then said the lovely bride, ‘Dear
Captain Murderer, what pie is this to be?’  He replied, ‘A meat pie.’
Then said the lovely bride, ‘Dear Captain Murderer, I see no meat.’  The
Captain humorously retorted, ‘Look in the glass.’  She looked in the
glass, but still she saw no meat, and then the Captain roared with
laughter, and suddenly frowning and drawing his sword, bade her roll out
the crust.  So she rolled out the crust, dropping large tears upon it all
the time because he was so cross, and when she had lined the dish with
crust and had cut the crust all ready to fit the top, the Captain called
out, ‘I see the meat in the glass!’  And the bride looked up at the
glass, just in time to see the Captain cutting her head off; and he
chopped her in pieces, and peppered her, and salted her, and put her in
the pie, and sent it to the baker’s, and ate it all, and picked the
bones.

‘Indeed I think it would; and not a little,’ said Martin.

It was a good thought; because without providing the stranger, in case
he should happen to be of a warm temper, with a sufficient excuse for
knocking him down, it implied this young man’s estimate of his quality,
and relieved his breast of the oppressive burden of rating him in secret
as a nameless and obscure individual.

At last there is a lair found out where Toughy, or the Tough Subject,
lays him down at night; and it is thought that the Tough Subject may
be Jo. Comparison of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the proprietress
of the house—a drunken face tied up in a black bundle, and flaring
out of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog-hutch which is her
private apartment—leads to the establishment of this conclusion.
Toughy has gone to the doctor’s to get a bottle of stuff for a sick
woman but will be here anon.

“Lord bless me!” ejaculated Mr. Grewgious. “Came alone! Why didn’t you
write to me to come and fetch you?”

“Susan, who is an old friend of mine, the oldest friend I have,” said
Florence, “is about to leave here suddenly, and quite alone, poor girl.
She is going home, a little way into the country. Might I ask you to
take care of her until she is in the coach?”

“Can you write your name, Nightingale?”

“‘Hollands, Sir,’ replied the sexton, trembling more than ever; for he
had bought it of the smugglers, and he thought that perhaps his
questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins.

‘Now go, Little Dorrit,’ said she, ‘or you will be late, poor child!’

Miss Tox made no verbal answer, but took up the little watering-pot
with a trembling hand, and looked vacantly round as if considering what
article of furniture would be improved by the contents. The room door
opening at this crisis of Miss Tox’s feelings, she started, laughed
aloud, and fell into the arms of the person entering; happily
insensible alike of Mrs Chick’s indignant countenance and of the Major
at his window over the way, who had his double-barrelled eye-glass in
full action, and whose face and figure were dilated with
Mephistophelean joy.

He was perfectly paralyzed by the sight. He looked at it again and
again without daring to touch it. Then, by a sudden impulse, he glanced
cautiously round, and seeing that he was wholly unobserved, and that
there was not a solitary being within sight, he picked up the purse and
thrust it into his pocket.

CHAPTER 63

FOLKESTONE, _Sunday, Sept. 30th, 1855._

“Bill,” cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast,
“the gentleman and that dear lady told me to-night of a home in some
foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let
me see them again, and beg them on my knees to show the same mercy
and goodness to you, and let us both leave this dreadful place, and
far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived except in
prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent.
They told me so—I feel it now—but we must have time—a little, little
time!”

The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to
me, and I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had uttered;
fruitlessly in any case, for there was no one near.

‘You’re a lie, Brittles,’ said Mr. Giles.

A Buffer, suddenly astounding the other three, by detaching himself, and
asserting individuality, inquires: ‘How discovered, and why?’

John Grueby added no entreaties, but he adopted a different kind of
persuasion, by putting his arm through one of Mr Haredale’s, while his
master took the other, and leading him away with all speed.

_Mrs. F._--What can he do! anything--he's a dancer; his pirouettes are
tremendous: only look here! (_She turns him round and round till he
falls down giddy._) See! he spins like a top; in fact he'll soon be the
top of his profession.

It was exactly the same No as before, and put another barrier up.

‘Oh you know what papa is,’ rejoined Flora, ‘and how aggravatingly he
sits looking beautiful and turning his thumbs over and over one another
till he makes one giddy if one keeps one’s eyes upon him, he said when
we were talking of you--I don’t know who began the subject Arthur (Doyce
and Clennam) but I am sure it wasn’t me, at least I hope not but you
really must excuse my confessing more on that point.’

Mr Flintwinch turned short round when he had made this remark, and went
into the dark hall. Clennam stood there, following him with his eyes,
as he dipped for a light in the phosphorus-box in the little room at the
side, got one after three or four dips, and lighted the dim lamp against
the wall. All the while, Clennam was pursuing the probabilities--rather
as if they were being shown to him by an invisible hand than as if he
himself were conjuring them up--of Mr Flintwinch’s ways and means of
doing that darker deed, and removing its traces by any of the black
avenues of shadow that lay around them.

‘Number two, you mean,’ said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed
with the quality of selfishness.

All this did not improve the gritty state of things in London, or the
air that London had acquired in Rosa’s eyes of waiting for something
that never came. Tired of working, and conversing with Miss Twinkleton,
she suggested working and reading: to which Miss Twinkleton readily
assented, as an admirable reader, of tried powers. But Rosa soon made
the discovery that Miss Twinkleton didn’t read fairly. She cut the
love-scenes, interpolated passages in praise of female celibacy, and
was guilty of other glaring pious frauds. As an instance in point, take
the glowing passage: “Ever dearest and best adored,—said Edward,
clasping the dear head to his breast, and drawing the silken hair
through his caressing fingers, from which he suffered it to fall like
golden rain,—ever dearest and best adored, let us fly from the
unsympathetic world and the sterile coldness of the stony-hearted, to
the rich warm Paradise of Trust and Love.” Miss Twinkleton’s fraudulent
version tamely ran thus: “Ever engaged to me with the consent of our
parents on both sides, and the approbation of the silver-haired rector
of the district,—said Edward, respectfully raising to his lips the
taper fingers so skilful in embroidery, tambour, crochet, and other
truly feminine arts,—let me call on thy papa ere to-morrow’s dawn has
sunk into the west, and propose a suburban establishment, lowly it may
be, but within our means, where he will be always welcome as an evening
guest, and where every arrangement shall invest economy, and constant
interchange of scholastic acquirements with the attributes of the
ministering angel to domestic bliss.”

“Because, my pretty cross-examiner,” replied the doctor: “because,
viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can
only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.
Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and
will take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been
the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a
police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman’s pocket; he has
been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman’s house, to a place
which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he
has not the remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who
seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and
is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very
moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing
that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a
blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose
to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don’t you see all this?”

‘Do my eyes deceive me,’ said Mr. Gregsbury, looking towards the speaker,
‘or is that my old friend Pugstyles?’

I said no more, but quietly went to the parlour and remained
waiting--such an immediate effect had his steady good sense on my
fevered mind. I overheard him say, "No, do not at present; she is not
fit for it." I was alarmed, and ran out; but I saw a lady retreating,
and I was grateful to him.

Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the
cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and
listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.

‘I will draw a veil over that dreamy life, Mr F. was in good spirits his
appetite was good he liked the cookery he considered the wine weak but
palatable and all was well, we returned to the immediate neighbourhood
of Number Thirty Little Gosling Street London Docks and settled down,
ere we had yet fully detected the housemaid in selling the feathers
out of the spare bed Gout flying upwards soared with Mr F. to another
sphere.’

KENNEDY'S HOTEL, EDINBURGH, _Sunday, Dec. 6th, 1868._

Amazement sits enthroned upon the countenances of Mr and Mrs Alfred
Lammle’s circle of acquaintance, when the disposal of their first-class
furniture and effects (including a Billiard Table in capital letters),
‘by auction, under a bill of sale,’ is publicly announced on a waving
hearthrug in Sackville Street. But, nobody is half so much amazed as
Hamilton Veneering, Esquire, M.P. for Pocket-Breaches, who instantly
begins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on
his soul’s register, who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has
in the world. Mrs Veneering, W.M.P. for Pocket-Breaches, like a faithful
wife shares her husband’s discovery and inexpressible astonishment.
Perhaps the Veneerings twain may deem the last unutterable feeling
particularly due to their reputation, by reason that once upon a time
some of the longer heads in the City are whispered to have shaken
themselves, when Veneering’s extensive dealings and great wealth were
mentioned. But, it is certain that neither Mr nor Mrs Veneering can
find words to wonder in, and it becomes necessary that they give to the
oldest and dearest friends they have in the world, a wondering dinner.

‘He entered the church. The evening service was concluded and the
congregation had dispersed, but it was not yet closed. His steps echoed
through the low building with a hollow sound, and he almost feared to be
alone, it was so still and quiet. He looked round him. Nothing was
changed. The place seemed smaller than it used to be; but there were the
old monuments on which he had gazed with childish awe a thousand times;
the little pulpit with its faded cushion; the Communion table before
which he had so often repeated the Commandments he had reverenced as a
child, and forgotten as a man. He approached the old seat; it looked
cold and desolate. The cushion had been removed, and the Bible was not
there. Perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat, or possibly she
had grown infirm and could not reach the church alone. He dared not
think of what he feared. A cold feeling crept over him, and he trembled
violently as he turned away. ‘An old man entered the porch just as he
reached it. Edmunds started back, for he knew him well; many a time he
had watched him digging graves in the churchyard. What would he say to
the returned convict?

‘Cut it short, old fellow,’ interrupted Walker, who knew from former
experience that he of the top-boots was neither very concise nor
intelligible in his narratives.

[Sidenote: Mr. John M. Makeham.]

‘He’s gone!’ cried Westwood, who, with the other second, had run up to
the body, and fallen on one knee beside it.

SCRAP NO. V.

‘There are as many as five out, to my knowledge.’

‘Come back?’ asked Newman.

“What you propose to do with it. Can it be used against me?”

“Still, Tony, you were on the wrong side of the post then,”
remonstrates Mr. Guppy. “You were talking about nothing else in the
gig.”

"Why it isn't possible," said Scrooge, "that I can have slept through a
whole day and far into another night!"

‘Yes,’ said Dick.

"You had better go to the back-door, old boy, and see who it is."

At the same moment, the Doctor looked at Mr. Goodchild, and whispered to
him, significantly:

"Miss Mowcher!"

Trotty was so shocked that it gave him no concern to see the Alderman
finish the tripe himself. It was a relief to get rid of it, anyhow.

‘Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘I make no stranger of you,
and therefore do not hesitate to say that Mr. Micawber’s difficulties
are coming to a crisis.’

One thing troubled me much, after we had fallen into this quiet train.
It was, that Dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy
or plaything. My aunt, with whom she gradually became familiar, always
called her Little Blossom; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia’s life was
to wait upon her, curl her hair, make ornaments for her, and treat her
like a pet child. What Miss Lavinia did, her sister did as a matter of
course. It was very odd to me; but they all seemed to treat Dora, in her
degree, much as Dora treated Jip in his.

MY DEAR STONE,

The constable, taking warning by this desperate attack, and thinking
perhaps that it would be more satisfactory to the ends of justice if
the prisoner were taken before a magistrate, whole, rather than in
small pieces, led him back to the hackney-coach without more ado, and
moreover insisted on Miss Brass becoming an outside passenger; to which
proposal the charming creature, after a little angry discussion,
yielded her consent; and so took her brother Sampson’s place upon the
box: Mr Brass with some reluctance agreeing to occupy her seat inside.
These arrangements perfected, they drove to the justice-room with all
speed, followed by the notary and his two friends in another coach.  Mr
Chuckster alone was left behind--greatly to his indignation; for he
held the evidence he could have given, relative to Kit’s returning to
work out the shilling, to be so very material as bearing upon his
hypocritical and designing character, that he considered its
suppression little better than a compromise of felony.

“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever
intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
would have cast my lot in an island?”

Miss Birdseye took the opportunity of informing a room-full of
attentive listeners, "that the shameless hussy, Laura Dyke, had
gone off with a man!" and so great was her horror, that, upon the
butcher-boy's bringing the meat, she wouldn't suffer him to come into
the passage, but kept the door ajar, for fear, as she said, "the fellow
should look at her!"

Do you think I could forget that? No.

_Belle._ In words; no, never.

I tried to command my voice in gently saying his name, but it trembled.
She repeated it to herself, two or three times, in a low tone. Then,
addressing me, she said, with enforced calmness:

‘Isn’t true!’ cried Mrs Gamp. ‘True! Don’t I know as that dear woman
is expecting of me at this minnit, Mr Westlock, and is a-lookin’ out of
window down the street, with little Tommy Harris in her arms, as calls
me his own Gammy, and truly calls, for bless the mottled little legs
of that there precious child (like Canterbury Brawn his own dear father
says, which so they are) his own I have been, ever since I found him,
Mr Westlock, with his small red worsted shoe a-gurglin’ in his throat,
where he had put it in his play, a chick, wile they was leavin’ of
him on the floor a-lookin’ for it through the ouse and him a-choakin’
sweetly in the parlour! Oh, Betsey Prig, what wickedness you’ve showed
this night, but never shall you darken Sairey’s doors agen, you twining
serpiant!’

‘Eh?’ said Brass, holding his head on one side, and throwing it a
little back, as connoisseurs do.  ‘Now I look at it again, I fancy I
see a--yes, there certainly is something in the smile that reminds me
of--and yet upon my word I--’

At her chair, as usual, was Rosa Dartle. From the first moment of her
dark eyes resting on me, I saw she knew I was the bearer of evil
tidings. The scar sprung into view that instant. She withdrew herself a
step behind the chair, to keep her own face out of Mrs. Steerforth's
observation; and scrutinised me with a piercing gaze that never
faltered, never shrunk.

"I thought you always went there on summer evenings," said Hamilton,
glancing over the paper as he spoke, and speaking in an uninterested
and careless style.

“J. B.“s own sentiment,” observed the Major, “expressed by J. B. fifty
thousand times!”

"What is it, Tip?"

It is a melancholy fact that Mr. Twigger having full licence to demand
a single glass of rum on the putting on of every piece of the armour,
got, by some means or other, rather out of his calculation in the hurry
and confusion of preparation, and drank about four glasses to a piece
instead of one, not to mention the something strong which went on the
top of it. Whether the brass armour checked the natural flow of
perspiration, and thus prevented the spirit from evaporating, we are
not scientific enough to know; but, whatever the cause was, Mr. Twigger
no sooner found himself outside the gate of Mudfog Hall, than he also
found himself in a very considerable state of intoxication; and hence
his extraordinary style of progressing. This was bad enough, but, as if
fate and fortune had conspired against Nicholas Tulrumble, Mr. Twigger,
not having been penitent for a good calendar month, took it into his
head to be most especially and particularly sentimental, just when his
repentance could have been most conveniently dispensed with. Immense
tears were rolling down his cheeks, and he was vainly endeavouring to
conceal his grief by applying to his eyes a blue cotton
pocket-handkerchief with white spots,—an article not strictly in
keeping with a suit of armour some three hundred years old, or
thereabouts.

CHAPTER 60

‘At this command, half a dozen officious goblins, with a perpetual smile
upon their faces, whom Gabriel Grub imagined to be courtiers, on that
account, hastily disappeared, and presently returned with a goblet of
liquid fire, which they presented to the king.

‘Well!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, breaking into a smile, after being for the
moment at a loss, ‘you are even more dispassionate than I expected,
Louisa.  Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have
it in charge to make?’

My answer was, that I had heard of the name.

‘I have done it. I have said you managed capitally. You and your wife
both. If you’ll go on managing capitally, I’ll go on doing my part. Only
don’t crow.’

I kissed him and dried my eyes. “I know now!” said I. “I have seen
this in your face a long while.”

‘Deyvle take me if I didn’t think it was the voice of Miss Nickleby.’

‘Not a bit of it,’ replied Sikes, interposing. ‘He’s used to it.

But it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in those days.
King John found one for his money, and sent him down to the castle of
Falaise. ‘On what errand dost thou come?’ said Hubert to this fellow.
‘To despatch young Arthur,’ he returned. ‘Go back to him who sent
thee,’ answered Hubert, ‘and say that I will do it!’

Lemon is a little hipped,
  And this is Lemon's true position--
  He is not pale, he's not white-lipped,
  Yet wants a little fresh condition.
  Sweeter 'tis to gaze upon
  Old Ocean's rising, falling billers,
  Than on the Houses every one
  That form the street called Saint Anne's Willers!
      Oh my Lemon, round and fat,
      Oh my bright, my right, my tight 'un,
      Think a little what you're at--
      Don't stay at home, but come to Brighton!

“‘We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs
are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to
work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we
ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his
people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,
and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should
most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out!’

[Sidenote: Mr. W. H. Wills.]

I looked at her inquiringly; but already with a foreknowledge of her
meaning.

"Goodwin," said Mrs. Pott, in a soft voice.

Eighteenth Day.

"Never mind, my dear Susan!" said the doctor, as he impressed a kiss on
the lips of the weeping maid; "you see, a doctor must marry, else people
have no confidence in him. You will bring me _credit_, credit will bring
me _patients_, the patients money, and, if they should fail, we have
good expectations. Your aunt, Miss Sarah Bugle, is forty odd, not far
from fifty, and rich enough for the seventh part of her fortune to help
us out of all our trouble. We may venture something upon that!"

Besides the monthly numbers of "Pickwick," which were going on through
this year until November, when the last number appeared, he had
commenced "Oliver Twist," which was appearing also monthly, in the
magazine called "Bentley's Miscellany," long before "Pickwick" was
completed. And during this year he had edited, for Mr. Bentley, "The
Life of Grimaldi," the celebrated clown. To this book he wrote himself
only the preface, and altered and rearranged the autobiographical MS.
which was in Mr. Bentley's possession.

"No, sir," answered the girl: "there is a gentleman with him;"--and
then she mentioned a name which increased his apprehensions. However,
plucking up all his courage, he advanced to the appointed chamber, and
in two minutes found himself in the presence of Mr. Hughes and his
accuser.

"The marriage that takes place to-day," said Caleb, "is with a stern,
sordid, grinding man. A hard master to you and me, my dear, for many
years. Ugly in his looks and in his nature. Cold and callous always.
Unlike what I have painted him to you in everything, my child. In
everything."

‘“Then take the consequences,” says the other.

‘I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in
mine,’ said the doctor.

"Oh!  God forgive this wretched man!" cried the boy, with a burst of
tears.

“Really, Lady Dedlock, I cannot make you a definite reply. I fear
not. Probably not yet. In our condition of life, we sometimes couple
an intention with our—our fancies which renders them not altogether
easy to throw off. I think it is rather our way to be in earnest.”

It was after a long interval that he looked round, and perceived
that his companion was gone.  Bells were unusual then.  He
proceeded to the door,--it was fastened.  He called aloud,--his
voice was echoed in a moment by many others, but in tones so wild
and discordant, that he desisted in involuntary terror.  As the day
advanced, and no one approached, he tried the window, and then
perceived for the first time it was grated.  It looked out on the
narrow flagged yard, in which no human being was; and if there had,
from such a being no human feeling could have been extracted.

"Copperfield," he said, "there must be two parties to a quarrel. I won't
be one."

But Mary had gone home after dressing her mistress, and the fat boy
came back again more disturbed than before.

It now became Miss Squeers’s turn to intercede with Nicholas, which she
did with many symptoms of alarm and horror; the effect of the double
intercession was, that he and John Browdie shook hands across the table
with much gravity; and such was the imposing nature of the ceremonial,
that Miss Squeers was overcome and shed tears.

‘How!’ repeated the blind man. ‘By eating and drinking. And how get meat
and drink, but by paying for it! Money!’ he cried, slapping his pocket.
‘Is money the word? Why, the streets have been running money. Devil send
that the sport’s not over yet, for these are jolly times; golden, rare,
roaring, scrambling times. Hallo, bully! Hallo! Hallo! Drink, bully,
drink. Where are ye there! Hallo!’

“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it--”

“‘Such as they were’?” said Allan, laughing.

“Shall it go, ma’am?” asked Oliver, looking up impatiently.

A pair of friends, though I was young,
    And Robert, seventy-two;

“Ay,” said the old man, “either to Barbados, or Jamaica, or Demerara,
that was what I asked.”

‘I do,’ returned the old woman.  ‘I mean it all.  If he hadn’t been
poring over his books out of fear of you, he would have been well and
merry now, I know he would.’

‘Why, I suppose if I wasn’t, I shouldn’t be here,’ replied Noah.
‘But, I say, she’ll be back if yer lose time.’

‘Five year ago, or then about,’ said Bill. ‘He had set up in the public
line here, and couldn’t meet his engagements, so he cut off to Liverpool
one day, without saying anything about it, and went and shipped himself
for the U-nited States.’

‘Not so much as the vorth o’ that ‘ere old umberella o’ yourn,’ replied
Sam.

“Anybody else, Louisa?” he said, without looking up, and turning over
the leaves.

I walked through and through the town all the rest of the day, and could
have walked there until now, I think.  In one place, there was a very
pretty modern theatre, where they had just performed the opera (always
popular in Verona) of Romeo and Juliet.  In another there was a
collection, under a colonnade, of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan remains,
presided over by an ancient man who might have been an Etruscan relic
himself; for he was not strong enough to open the iron gate, when he had
unlocked it, and had neither voice enough to be audible when he described
the curiosities, nor sight enough to see them: he was so very old.  In
another place, there was a gallery of pictures: so abominably bad, that
it was quite delightful to see them mouldering away.  But anywhere: in
the churches, among the palaces, in the streets, on the bridge, or down
beside the river: it was always pleasant Verona, and in my remembrance
always will be.

‘I hope everybody does.’

The cry arose again, and there was a terrible and confusing rush of the
women into the midst of the struggle.  In another moment, something came
tumbling down upon me that I thought was the wall.  It was a heap of
Sambos who had come over the wall; and of four men who clung to my legs
like serpents, one who clung to my right leg was Christian George King.

“I beg your pardon, Sir;” a touch falls gently on his mourning cloak;
“but as you wish it done immediately, and it may be put in hand when I
get back—”

Happy blind girl! How merry she was in her joy!

"She lives still--she lives!  Thank God, thank God!"

"Do you help her, Mr. Dick," said Traddles, "if you please."

As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis) to
say--he being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic
temperament, and not at all conversational--I offered him a cake as a
mark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant,
and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have
done on an elephant's.

But they never blushed upon a change in the new manner of her thought
and speech towards her daughter. And though that daughter often came
within their influence, they never blushed upon her loveliness
irradiated by a smile, or softened by the light of filial love, in its
stern beauty.

Mr. Jasper’s steadiness of face and figure becomes so marvellous that
his breathing seems to have stopped.

But the anguish and suffering of the two sons of one of these men, when
they heard, or fancied that they heard, their father’s voice, is past
description. After wringing their hands and rushing to and fro as if
they were stark mad, one mounted on the shoulders of his brother, and
tried to clamber up the face of the high wall, guarded at the top with
spikes and points of iron. And when he fell among the crowd, he was not
deterred by his bruises, but mounted up again, and fell again, and, when
he found the feat impossible, began to beat the stones and tear them
with his hands, as if he could that way make a breach in the strong
building, and force a passage in. At last, they cleft their way among
the mob about the door, though many men, a dozen times their match, had
tried in vain to do so, and were seen, in--yes, in--the fire, striving
to prize it down, with crowbars.

‘Oh, if you come to that—’ said the light-haired man, meekly.

‘I should like to have known him,’ remarked the dwarf. ‘I dare say he
was a blessed creature then; but I’m sure he is now. It was a happy
release. I believe he had suffered a long time?’

‘It’s better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so!’ said I.

It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been
sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and
fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from
the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance
between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers
will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great
heroism on Mr. Bumble’s part: he being in some sort tempted by time,
place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,
which however well they may become the lips of the light and
thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the
land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other
great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the
stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be
the sternest and most inflexible among them all.

"I also.  I know of myself that way--if that way satisfies."

[Illustration: THE UNEDUCATED FATHER IN FUSTIAN AND THE EDUCATED BOY IN
SPECTACLES--Book 9, chap. v.]

The opinion of the Yard was divided respecting the derivation of its
name. The more practical of its inmates abided by the tradition of a
murder; the gentler and more imaginative inhabitants, including the
whole of the tender sex, were loyal to the legend of a young lady of
former times closely imprisoned in her chamber by a cruel father for
remaining true to her own true love, and refusing to marry the suitor he
chose for her. The legend related how that the young lady used to be
seen up at her window behind the bars, murmuring a love-lorn song of
which the burden was, ‘Bleeding Heart, Bleeding Heart, bleeding away,’
until she died. It was objected by the murderous party that this Refrain
was notoriously the invention of a tambour-worker, a spinster and
romantic, still lodging in the Yard. But, forasmuch as all favourite
legends must be associated with the affections, and as many more people
fall in love than commit murder--which it may be hoped, howsoever bad we
are, will continue until the end of the world to be the dispensation
under which we shall live--the Bleeding Heart, Bleeding Heart, bleeding
away story, carried the day by a great majority. Neither party would
listen to the antiquaries who delivered learned lectures in the
neighbourhood, showing the Bleeding Heart to have been the heraldic
cognisance of the old family to whom the property had once belonged.
And, considering that the hour-glass they turned from year to year was
filled with the earthiest and coarsest sand, the Bleeding Heart Yarders
had reason enough for objecting to be despoiled of the one little golden
grain of poetry that sparkled in it.

As I rode back in the lonely night, the wind going by me like a restless
memory, I thought of this, and feared she was not happy. I was not
happy; but, thus far, I had faithfully set the seal upon the Past, and,
thinking of her, pointing upward, thought of her as pointing to that
sky above me, where, in the mystery to come, I might yet love her with
a love unknown on earth, and tell her what the strife had been within me
when I loved her here.

‘And before you were so far away from it.’

THE KEY OF GRANADA.

‘Thank’ee, Wegg, both for your confidence in me and for your frequent
dropping into poetry; both of which is friendly. Well, then; my idea is,
that you should give up your stall, and that I should put you into the
Bower here, to keep it for us. It’s a pleasant spot; and a man with
coals and candles and a pound a week might be in clover here.’

The Serjeant was writing when his clients entered; he bowed abstractedly
when Mr. Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor; and then, motioning
them to a seat, put his pen carefully in the inkstand, nursed his left
leg, and waited to be spoken to.

‘The moral being—I believe that’s the right expression—of this
exemplary person, derived its highest gratification from anathematizing
his nearest relations and turning them out of doors. Having begun (as
was natural) by rendering these attentions to the wife of his bosom,
he next found himself at leisure to bestow a similar recognition on the
claims of his daughter. He chose a husband for her, entirely to his own
satisfaction and not in the least to hers, and proceeded to settle upon
her, as her marriage portion, I don’t know how much Dust, but something
immense. At this stage of the affair the poor girl respectfully
intimated that she was secretly engaged to that popular character whom
the novelists and versifiers call Another, and that such a marriage
would make Dust of her heart and Dust of her life—in short, would
set her up, on a very extensive scale, in her father’s business.
Immediately, the venerable parent—on a cold winter’s night, it is
said—anathematized and turned her out.’

I read the letter over several times. Making due allowance for Mr.
Micawber’s lofty style of composition, and for the extraordinary relish
with which he sat down and wrote long letters on all possible and
impossible occasions, I still believed that something important lay
hidden at the bottom of this roundabout communication. I put it down,
to think about it; and took it up again, to read it once more; and
was still pursuing it, when Traddles found me in the height of my
perplexity.

THE READER’S PASSPORT

Every cell has double doors: the outer one of sturdy oak, the other of
grated iron, wherein there is a trap through which his food is handed.
He has a Bible, and a slate and pencil, and, under certain restrictions,
has sometimes other books, provided for the purpose, and pen and ink and
paper.  His razor, plate, and can, and basin, hang upon the wall, or
shine upon the little shelf.  Fresh water is laid on in every cell, and
he can draw it at his pleasure.  During the day, his bedstead turns up
against the wall, and leaves more space for him to work in.  His loom, or
bench, or wheel, is there; and there he labours, sleeps and wakes, and
counts the seasons as they change, and grows old.

‘Emma!’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘The cloud is past from my mind. Mutual
confidence, so long preserved between us once, is restored, to know
no further interruption. Now, welcome poverty!’ cried Mr. Micawber,
shedding tears. ‘Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger,
rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the
end!’

‘My dear Eugene.’

"Come!" cried one of them.

"'What do you say, wretch?' cried M'Flummery, rushing and collaring
Snaps, 'Impudence!'

Church of the Seven, legend of the, 530.

The old woman nodded in the affirmative; and a few more paces brought
them to the threshold. There was the light of fire and candle in the
room where Alice had sat to dry her clothes; and on her knocking at the
door, John Carker appeared from that room.

"The very thing that occurred to me," said Ben Allen.

“What’ll you give, gen’lmen? Come, don’t be too hard on a poor man.
What’ll you give?”

Stephen gravely shook his head.

“I tell you it was your doing,—I tell you it was done through you,” he
retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the
vacant air between us. “I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you
to-night. _I_ giv’ it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a
limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn’t have come
to life again. But it warn’t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was
favoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?
Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.”

The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,
and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre
of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms
stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow
cloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the
door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity
that was of its kind quite dreadful.

“Well, what _do_ you know of him?” inquired the old gentleman. “Speak
out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What _do_ you know of
him?”

THE END.

“He can’t live a week, the doctor says,” pursued, Mr. Bumble. “He is
the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that
wacancy must be filled up. Oh Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens!
What a opportunity for a joining of hearts and housekeeping!”

Kissing her again, he turned round, drew the coverlet over his head, and
lay as still as if that time had come by which she had adjured him.  She
stood for some time at the bedside before she slowly moved away.  She
stopped at the door, looked back when she had opened it, and asked him if
he had called her?  But he lay still, and she softly closed the door and
returned to her room.

"Go!" exclaimed the Dodger. "Why, where's your spirit? Don't you take
any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your
friends, eh?"

The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many
piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her
best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would
never leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed
the door, and returned to the bedside. On being excluded, the old
ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old
Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition
to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was
labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which
had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by
the worthy old ladies themselves.

After breakfast next morning, we sallied forth to see the lions.  Such a
delicious breeze was blowing in, from the north, as made the walk
delightful: though the pavement-stones, and stones of the walls and
houses, were far too hot to have a hand laid on them comfortably.

‘I know I ain’t as cunning as you are,’ replied Charlotte; ‘but
don’t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.
You would have been if I had been, any way.’

“Thank you, madam. I have read in the newspapers,” said Mr. Grewgious,
stammering a little, “that when a distinguished visitor (not that I am
one: far from it) goes to a school (not that this is one: far from it),
he asks for a holiday, or some sort of grace. It being now the
afternoon in the—College—of which you are the eminent head, the young
ladies might gain nothing, except in name, by having the rest of the
day allowed them. But if there is any young lady at all under a cloud,
might I solicit—”

‘What’s the meaning of this?’ said Toby when they had returned. ‘He
can’t be coming here. I--I--hope not.’

‘And what’s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?’
cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.

“Yes, perhaps I ought to mention,” said Herbert, who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting
theme, “that she is rather below my mother’s nonsensical family
notions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.
I think he was a species of purser.”

‘If you’re not an idiot,’ said Miss Brass harshly, ‘hold your peace.’

Nicholas, being left alone, took half-a-dozen turns up and down the room
in a condition of much agitation and excitement; but, growing gradually
calmer, sat himself down in a chair, and mentally resolved that, come
what come might, he would endeavour, for a time, to bear whatever
wretchedness might be in store for him, and that remembering the
helplessness of his mother and sister, he would give his uncle no
plea for deserting them in their need. Good resolutions seldom fail of
producing some good effect in the mind from which they spring. He grew
less desponding, and--so sanguine and buoyant is youth--even hoped that
affairs at Dotheboys Hall might yet prove better than they promised.

"Silence, Mr. Steerforth!" said Mr. Mell.

CHAPTER XV-ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE THIRD, CALLED, OF WINCHESTER

"I am sorry to say, Mr. Copperfield, I can't advance your object," said
Mr. Jorkins, nervously. "The fact is--but I have an appointment at the
Bank, if you'll have the goodness to excuse me."

‘Yes; and it’s pleasant to know that you are Mrs Boffin,’ said her
husband, ‘and it’s been a pleasant thing to know this many and many a
year!’ It was ruin to Mrs Boffin’s aspirations, but, having so spoken,
they sat side by side, a hopelessly Unfashionable pair.

The shopkeepers of the town, although they had a very indistinct notion
of the nature of the offence, could not but be much edified and
gratified by this spectacle. Here was the strong arm of the law, coming
down with twenty gold-beater force, upon two offenders from the
metropolis itself; the mighty engine was directed by their own
magistrate, and worked by their own officers; and both the criminals, by
their united efforts, were securely shut up, in the narrow compass of
one sedan-chair. Many were the expressions of approval and admiration
which greeted Mr. Grummer, as he headed the cavalcade, staff in hand;
loud and long were the shouts raised by the unsoaped; and amidst these
united testimonials of public approbation, the procession moved slowly
and majestically along.

Ralph took no notice of these supplications, but sat for three or four
minutes in a brown study, looking thoughtfully at the person from whom
they proceeded. After sufficient cogitation he broke silence, and
it certainly could not be objected that he used any needless
circumlocution, or failed to speak directly to the purpose.

The child said yes.

‘He has minded the office again,’ said Brass triumphantly; ‘he has had
my confidence, and he shall continue to have it; he--why, where’s the--’

"It wasn't me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys," said
Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round: "they are
here somewhere."

I cannot tell in any words what the state of my mind was when I saw
in her hand my handkerchief with which I had covered the dead baby.

‘I am glad you have come at last, Stephen.  You are very late.’

‘You shall, sir,’ said Pancks, ‘if you believe me worthy of it.’

“Next month?”

“Most willingly,” he retorted, “if I could. But, my dear Miss
Summerson, I have no art, no disguise. If he takes me by the hand and
leads me through Westminster Hall in an airy procession after
fortune, I must go. If he says, ‘Skimpole, join the dance!’ I must
join it. Common sense wouldn’t, I know, but I have NO common sense.”

CHAPTER 50. Mr Toots’s Complaint

I have been hammering away in that strenuous manner at my book, that I
have had leisure for scarcely any letters but such, as I have been
obliged to write; having a horrible temptation when I lay down my
book-pen to run out on the breezy downs here, tear up the hills, slide
down the same, and conduct myself in a frenzied manner, for the relief
that only exercise gives me.

She drew herself up, growing pale. “I, sir? No; I only wished that you
should do my husband justice. For the woman--no matter. I will not
detain you, Captain Roberts.” And so, scarcely waiting for me to speak
to the boy, she drew him away with her.

It was in April that he disappeared, like a flea, under my very eyes.
The Strader lay at the wharf, at Cincinnati; it was Sunday, about noon;
she was to get up steam at seven o’clock next morning. I walked up the
levee, and just off the cobble-stones met Wylie. He had a drum of figs
in his hand which he had just bought from some pedler on the David Swan,
and was going to take home to his little Joe, in Cairo, he said, as he
walked alongside of me.

In famine, sickness, hunger, thirst,
          The two were still but one,
        Until the strong man drooped the first,
          And felt his labours done.
        Then to a trusty friend he spake,
          "Across the desert wide,
        O take this poor boy for my sake!"
              And kissed the child and died.

At this point of the inquiry Oliver raised his head, and, looking round
with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water.

Still she looked fixedly upon her, and made no reply.

"And of such a tailor! quite a fashionable tailor; a bright blue cloth,
with bright buttons; it's a deal too good a coat for me."

"I hope I shall often see you again," I said; on which I own poor
Manasseh gave a dreadful grin, and shot back into his parlor.

“Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew, laying
his hand upon it after a short pause.

But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s.
Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s?
Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to
Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each
particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business,
its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.

Every part of the house was in such order, and every one was so
attentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys,
though what with trying to remember the contents of each little
store-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate
about jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and
china, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a
methodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy
that I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell
ring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been
installed into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they
were all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take
a peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it
quite a delightful place—in front, the pretty avenue and drive by
which we had approached (and where, by the by, we had cut up the
gravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll
it); at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at her window up
there, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if she would have
kissed me from that distance. Beyond the flower-garden was a
kitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard,
and then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with its
three peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large,
some so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the
south-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable,
welcoming look—it was, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with
her arm through that of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold
thing to say, though he only pinched her dear cheek for it.

I repair to the enchanted house, where there are lights, chattering,
music, flowers, officers (I am sorry to see), and the eldest Miss
Larkins, a blaze of beauty. She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers
in her hair--forget-me-nots--as if _she_ had any need to wear
forget-me-nots! It is the first really grown-up party that I have ever
been invited to, and I am a little uncomfortable; for I appear not
to belong to anybody, and nobody appears to have anything to say to
me, except Mr. Larkins, who asks me how my schoolfellows are, which
he needn't do, as I have not come there to be insulted. But after I
have stood in the doorway for some time, and feasted my eyes upon
the goddess of my heart, she approaches me--she, the eldest Miss
Larkins!--and asks me, pleasantly, if I dance.

The judge looked sternly at Sam for full two minutes, but Sam's
features were so perfectly calm and serene that the judge said nothing,
and motioned Serjeant Buzfuz to proceed.

‘There was, further, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle
Parker. Ah! When a man thinks of the loss of such patronage as that;
when a man finds so fair a garden rooted up by pigs; he finds it hard
indeed, without going high, to work it into money. But I leave it wholly
to you, sir.’

“No!” he answered, in a wondering tone.

"Certainly, sir," replied the landlord.

‘Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?’ said Rose.
‘This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to
me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?’

The meek little barber stood gazing at him with the brush and soap-dish
in his hand, stirring them round and round in a ludicrous uncertainty,
as if he were disabled by some fascination from beginning. At last he
made a dash at Mr Bailey’s cheek. Then he stopped again, as if the
ghost of a beard had suddenly receded from his touch; but receiving mild
encouragement from Mr Bailey, in the form of an adjuration to ‘Go in and
win,’ he lathered him bountifully. Mr Bailey smiled through the suds in
his satisfaction. ‘Gently over the stones, Poll. Go a tip-toe over the
pimples!’

the character of Oliver Twist. This letter was published in "Harper's
New Monthly Magazine," in 1862.

The Jew lifted up his eyes, and took in Eugene once more, at another
glance.

‘The other party, and a surgeon, I suppose,’ said Mr. Snodgrass; ‘take a
drop of brandy.’ Mr. Winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend
proffered, and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid.

MY DEAR FORSTER,

"Come along," shouted the old gentleman, addressing Mr. Winkle; "a keen
hand like you ought to have been up long ago, even to such poor work as
this."

And there the subject dropped for that time.  But I so contrived as that
they should come together shortly afterwards.  I had previously so
contrived as to keep them asunder; for while I loved her,—I mean before I
had determined on my sacrifice,—a lurking jealousy of Mr. Granville lay
within my unworthy breast.

“I don’t care for hard names,” interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.
“You know the fact, and that’s enough for me.”

“IS he?” Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write.

SURPRISES TOM PINCH VERY MUCH, AND SHOWS HOW CERTAIN CONFIDENCES PASSED
BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SISTER

CHAPTER IX.
In which the Wooden Midshipman gets into Trouble

"Very good," said the rough man, who now for the first time cast
the shadow of his condescension over me. "You are the lord of quick
understanding, and see things."

“More good than a dozen doctors. For I love him dearly, and I don’t
love doctors, or doctors’ stuff.”

‘Well, she’s unsettled at present,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘It ain’t that she’s
not as pretty as ever, for she’s prettier--I do assure you, she is
prettier. It ain’t that she don’t work as well as ever, for she does.
She WAS worth any six, and she IS worth any six. But somehow she wants
heart. If you understand,’ said Mr. Omer, after rubbing his chin again,
and smoking a little, ‘what I mean in a general way by the expression,
“A long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull altogether, my hearties,
hurrah!” I should say to you, that that was--in a general way--what I
miss in Em’ly.’

‘He has put up for the night, at an Angler’s Inn,’ was the fatigued and
hoarse reply. ‘He goes on, up the river, at six in the morning. I have
come back for a couple of hours’ rest.’

‘Is he deaf?’ inquired one of the young ladies.

"Good night, sir," I replied.

To this mansion, Mr. Pecksniff, accompanied by his daughters and Mrs.
Todgers, drove gallantly in a one-horse fly. The foregoing ceremonies
having been all performed, they were ushered into the house, and so, by
degrees, they got at last into a small room with books in it, where Mr.
Pinch's sister was at that moment instructing her eldest pupil: to wit,
a little woman thirteen years old, who had already arrived at such a
pitch of whalebone and education that she had nothing girlish about her;
which was a source of great rejoicing to all her relations and friends.

*Chapter III.*

“Bunsby aboard?” cried the Captain, hailing the boy in a stentorian
voice, as if he were half-a-mile off instead of two yards.

Ever believe me, your affectionate Friend.

“My lad,” said the Captain, whose opinion of Mr Toots was much improved
by this candid avowal, “a man’s thoughts is like the winds, and nobody
can’t answer for ’em for certain, any length of time together. Is it a
treaty as to words?”

Back they went to the lodgings again, after they had bought some eggs,
and flour, and such small matters; and Tom sat gravely down to write at
one end of the parlour table, while Ruth prepared to make the pudding at
the other end; for there was nobody in the house but an old woman (the
landlord being a mysterious sort of man, who went out early in the
morning, and was scarcely ever seen); and saving in mere household
drudgery, they waited on themselves.

It was with a very melancholy laugh that Newman Noggs concluded this
soliloquy; and it was with a very melancholy shake of the head, and a
very rueful countenance, that he turned about, and went plodding on his
way.

24.  Fortune-Telling

Not being able, in the absence of any change of clothes, to go to church
that day, we were compelled to decline these kindnesses, one and all; and
I was reluctantly obliged to forego the delight of hearing Dr. Channing,
who happened to preach that morning for the first time in a very long
interval.  I mention the name of this distinguished and accomplished man
(with whom I soon afterwards had the pleasure of becoming personally
acquainted), that I may have the gratification of recording my humble
tribute of admiration and respect for his high abilities and character;
and for the bold philanthropy with which he has ever opposed himself to
that most hideous blot and foul disgrace—Slavery.

Oliver hastened to comply with the request; and the young lady, making
an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier
tune; but her fingers dropped powerless on the keys, and covering her
face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears
which she was now unable to repress.

Old Sol wiped his spectacles, and faintly smiled.

VOL. II.

“Don’t sit there, dear,” says his affectionate mother, stopping to snuff
the candle on the first landing.

‘Coom, coom,’ said John, with a broad grin; ‘thou know’st betther than
thot, Tilly.’

Peggotty’s business, which was what we used to call ‘common-form
business’ in the Commons (and very light and lucrative the common-form
business was), being settled, I took her down to the office one morning
to pay her bill. Mr. Spenlow had stepped out, old Tiffey said, to get a
gentleman sworn for a marriage licence; but as I knew he would be
back directly, our place lying close to the Surrogate’s, and to the
Vicar-General’s office too, I told Peggotty to wait.

And away they go.

‘Truly, I think so,’ returned his friend.  ‘Bitzer, turn you about and
take yourself home. Jupe, stay here a moment.  Let me hear of your
running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the
master of the school.  You understand what I mean.  Go along.’

"Spirit!" he said, "this is a fearful place. In leaving it,
I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!"

"Yes, I see him," was his reply. "He's well enough, but I see nothing
particular about him or the horse either."

‘You can finish off what you’re at,’ said Mr. Bounderby, with a meaning
nod, ‘and then go elsewhere.’

"He was a brute to you, Traddles," said I, indignantly; for his good
humour made me feel as if I had seen him beaten but yesterday.

“He’s in luck, then,” said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.
“Never mind where I came from, young ’un; you’ll find your way there,
soon enough, I’ll bet a crown!”

‘The son of a gentleman!’

‘Do you think of soon returning to the old country?’ says I.

After all, too, if you _should_, through any unlucky breakdown, come to
be afraid of it, I am no worse off than I was before, if I have to do it
at last. Keep your pecker up with that.

Still, Polly persevered with all the better heart for seeing this; and,
judging of Mr Dombey by herself, had great confidence in the mute
appeal of poor little Florence’s mourning dress. “It’s hard indeed,”
thought Polly, “if he takes only to one little motherless child, when
he has another, and that a girl, before his eyes.”

Florence had no words to answer with. She only said, “Oh, dear, dear
Paul! oh, Walter!”

How goes the night now?  Saint George of Southwark answers with twelve
blows upon his bell.  Parker, good night, for Williams is already waiting
over in the region of Ratcliffe Highway, to show the houses where the
sailors dance.

"In that case," said Mr. Pickwick, "I shall have great pleasure in
coming."

Rokesmith departed on that errand, and presently returned accompanied by
Mr Boffin at his jog-trot. Bella felt a little vague trepidation as to
the subject-matter of this same consultation, until Mrs Boffin announced
it.

“I am not required to go yet; I would not desert him, dear Miss
Summerson, even if I were.”

As our Narrative was finished in our second volume, this volume consists
of Letters _only_, with occasional foot-notes wherever there are
allusions requiring explanation.

“Hush! Hush!” The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened
whisper, “My Lady, I have not breathed a word of it, I don’t believe
what’s written in it, I know it can’t be true, I am sure and certain
that it is not true. But my son is in danger, and you must have a
heart to pity me. If you know of anything that is not known to
others, if you have any suspicion, if you have any clue at all, and
any reason for keeping it in your own breast, oh, my dear Lady, think
of me, and conquer that reason, and let it be known! This is the most
I consider possible. I know you are not a hard lady, but you go your
own way always without help, and you are not familiar with your
friends; and all who admire you—and all do—as a beautiful and
elegant lady, know you to be one far away from themselves who can’t
be approached close. My Lady, you may have some proud or angry
reasons for disdaining to utter something that you know; if so, pray,
oh, pray, think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been
passed in this family which she dearly loves, and relent, and help to
clear my son! My Lady, my good Lady,” the old housekeeper pleads with
genuine simplicity, “I am so humble in my place and you are by nature
so high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child,
but I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg
and pray you not to be scornful of us if you can do us any right or
justice at this fearful time!”

“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And
if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep
for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred
tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank
God for us, thank God!”

‘I am sorry, friend,’ replied the King, ‘that my vessel is already
chosen, and that I cannot (therefore) sail with the son of the man who
served my father. But the Prince and all his company shall go along
with you, in the fair White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors of
renown.’

"Let him come, then, and help in the stables, and we'll see what he can
do."--"May the Lord--"

It was now sunset.  The Hermit had betaken himself to his bed of cinders
half an hour ago, and lying on it in his blanket and skewer with his back
to the window, took not the smallest heed of the appeal addressed to him.

“He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.
“We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”

“Why, do you think?” inquired Fagin, parrying the question.

Another dance was near its close, when Mr. Snitchey touched his partner,
who was looking on, upon the arm.

CHAPTER 26

That was plainly to be seen, for Ma was talking then at her usual
canter, with arched head and mane, opened eyes and nostrils.

‘Tell me again whose knife was this?’ demanded the man.

‘There is no need,’ said Mr Milvey. ‘We know it. Are you better, Mr
Wrayburn?’

CAPTAIN BOLDHEART AND THE LATIN-GRAMMAR MASTER

‘If you’re a wise man,’ growled Hugh, raising his head to look at him
with a frown, ‘you’ll hold your tongue. I tell you I’m going to sleep.’

‘I must say more. I cannot let you leave me so! For Heaven’s sake,
Agnes, let us not mistake each other after all these years, and all
that has come and gone with them! I must speak plainly. If you have any
lingering thought that I could envy the happiness you will confer; that
I could not resign you to a dearer protector, of your own choosing; that
I could not, from my removed place, be a contented witness of your joy;
dismiss it, for I don’t deserve it! I have not suffered quite in vain.
You have not taught me quite in vain. There is no alloy of self in what
I feel for you.’

“Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?” said Mr.
Jarndyce.

But there’s something else besides.  Don’t look at the next story-teller,
for there’s more yet.  Next day, it was resolved that the Society should
make it up with Jane, and then be dissolved.  What do you think of Jane
being gone, though!  “What?  Gone for ever?” said our fellows, with long
faces.  “Yes, to be sure,” was all the answer they could get.  None of
the people about the house would say anything more.  At length, the first
boy took upon himself to ask the Reverend whether our old friend Jane was
really gone?  The Reverend (he has got a daughter at home—turn-up nose,
and red) replied severely, “Yes, sir, Miss Pitt is gone.”  The idea of
calling Jane, Miss Pitt!  Some said she had been sent away in disgrace
for taking money from Old Cheeseman; others said she had gone into Old
Cheeseman’s service at a rise of ten pounds a year.  All that our fellows
knew, was, she was gone.

‘I want to introduce two very clever people to each other,’ said Mrs.
Leo Hunter. ‘Mr. Pickwick, I have great pleasure in introducing you to
Count Smorltork.’ She added in a hurried whisper to Mr. Pickwick--‘The
famous foreigner--gathering materials for his great work on England--
hem!--Count Smorltork, Mr. Pickwick.’

"There is nothing good that is forgotten," he replied kindly.  "There is
not an angel added to the host of Heaven but does its blessed work on
earth in those that loved it here."

CHAPTER LIV. CONTAINING SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE DOUBLE KNOCK,
AND OTHER MATTERS: AMONG WHICH CERTAIN INTERESTING DISCLOSURES RELATIVE
TO MR. SNODGRASS AND A YOUNG LADY ARE BY NO MEANS IRRELEVANT TO THIS
HISTORY

"Well, well!" said the Doctor, "I am too old to be converted, even by
my friend Snitchey here, or my good spinster sister, Martha Jeddler;
who had what she calls her domestic trials ages ago, and has led a
sympathising life with all sorts of people ever since; and who is so
much of your opinion (only she's less reasonable and more obstinate,
being a woman), that we can't agree, and seldom meet. I was born upon
this battle-field. I began, as a boy, to have my thoughts directed to
the real history of a battle-field. Sixty years have gone over my head;
and I have never seen the Christian world, including Heaven knows how
many loving mothers and good enough girls, like mine here, anything but
mad for a battle-field. The same contradictions prevail in everything.
One must either laugh or cry at such stupendous inconsistencies; and I
prefer to laugh."

‘I don’t know that it will be a girl, yet, ma’am,’ said my mother
innocently.

"No, I will not," answered the sleepy Harlequin.

‘MR. PICKWICK would not put up to be put down by clamour. He had alluded
to the honourable gentleman. (Great excitement.)

‘Has he any parents?’ inquired Mr. Fang.

Indeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable
scheme, hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers,
an utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up,
bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes, the fear of
detection and ruin and death, and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by
all,—these were the passionate considerations that following close
upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain
of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at
his heart.

“Another word, Rose,” said Harry. “Your reason in your own words. From
your own lips let me hear it.”

‘—The parrot that I bought of her,’ said Venus, with a despondent rise
and fall of his eyes. ‘Yes; there it lies on its side, dried up; except
for its plumage, very like myself. I’ve never had the heart to prepare
it, and I never shall have now.’

"I love thee ere the skies were spread;
My soul bears all thy pains;
To gain thy love my sacred Heart
In earthly shrines remains:
Vain are thy offerings, vain thy sighs,
Without one gift divine,
Give it, my child, thy Heart to me,
And it shall rest in mine!"

‘Bitzer,’ said Thomas Gradgrind.  ‘Your definition of a horse.’

‘It’s better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable, isn’t it?’ said
Dora.

“You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?” said the
gentleman.

Mrs Chick rose erect with these words, and took the arm of Mr Chick,
who escorted her from the room, after half an hour’s shady sojourn
there. And it is due to her penetration to observe that she certainly
was not missed at all.

‘Now,’ muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, ‘if there is any
deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you
are.’

‘This very complete little kitchen of ours,’ said Mortimer, ‘in which
nothing will ever be cooked—’

Benjamin’s mother took the candle at once, and lighted Trottle briskly to
the stairs; and Benjamin himself tried to follow as usual.  But getting
up several flights of stairs, even helped by the bannisters, was more,
with his particular complaint, than he seemed to feel himself inclined to
venture on.  He sat down obstinately on the lowest step, with his head
against the wall, and the tails of his big great-coat spreading out
magnificently on the stairs behind him and above him, like a dirty
imitation of a court lady’s train.

The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.

‘What Matilda?’ inquired Hicks, starting up.

‘Why, my dear! Could we?’

‘Every one of ‘em,’ replied Dennis. ‘Every man Jack!’

Terrified to be left there by himself, under such desolate
circumstances, and after all he had seen and heard that night, Solomon
would have followed, but there had been something in Mr Haredale’s
manner and his look, the recollection of which held him spellbound. He
stood rooted to the spot; and scarcely venturing to breathe, looked up
with mingled fear and wonder.

‘Now, Sir, wot’s the matter?’ replied Sam, returning the push with
compound interest.

‘Here we are,’ said Mr. Crummles.

"Eleven, sir," replied Oliver.

In this order, we begin the descent: sometimes on foot, sometimes
shuffling on the ice: always proceeding much more quietly and slowly,
than on our upward way: and constantly alarmed by the falling among us of
somebody from behind, who endangers the footing of the whole party, and
clings pertinaciously to anybody’s ankles.  It is impossible for the
litter to be in advance, too, as the track has to be made; and its
appearance behind us, overhead—with some one or other of the bearers
always down, and the rather heavy gentleman with his legs always in the
air—is very threatening and frightful.  We have gone on thus, a very
little way, painfully and anxiously, but quite merrily, and regarding it
as a great success—and have all fallen several times, and have all been
stopped, somehow or other, as we were sliding away—when Mr. Pickle of
Portici, in the act of remarking on these uncommon circumstances as quite
beyond his experience, stumbles, falls, disengages himself, with quick
presence of mind, from those about him, plunges away head foremost, and
rolls, over and over, down the whole surface of the cone!

From that time, there sprung up in the old man’s mind, a solicitude
about the child which never slept or left him.  There are chords in the
human heart--strange, varying strings--which are only struck by
accident; which will remain mute and senseless to appeals the most
passionate and earnest, and respond at last to the slightest casual
touch.  In the most insensible or childish minds, there is some train
of reflection which art can seldom lead, or skill assist, but which
will reveal itself, as great truths have done, by chance, and when the
discoverer has the plainest end in view.  From that time, the old man
never, for a moment, forgot the weakness and devotion of the child;
from the time of that slight incident, he who had seen her toiling by
his side through so much difficulty and suffering, and had scarcely
thought of her otherwise than as the partner of miseries which he felt
severely in his own person, and deplored for his own sake at least as
much as hers, awoke to a sense of what he owed her, and what those
miseries had made her.  Never, no, never once, in one unguarded moment
from that time to the end, did any care for himself, any thought of his
own comfort, any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts
from the gentle object of his love.

Just at the end of the dinner Pip thought his time had come to be found
out, for his sister said graciously to her guests--

This was a red-letter day in Grimaldi's calendar; he had nothing to
do in the evening at Drury Lane until the last scene but one of Blue
Beard, so went shopping with his future wife, buying divers articles of
plate, and such other small wares as young housekeepers require.

"Uriah Heep," said Mr. Wickfield, in a monotonous forced way, "is active
in the business, Trotwood. What he says, I quite concur in. You know I
had an old interest in you. Apart from that, what Uriah says I quite
concur in!"

"Rely on it, sir," continued the fidgety little virtuoso, "you are
mistaken in your estimate of that painting. They say it is a Paul
Potter; but it's no such thing--no such thing, sir."

‘Well!’ said Squeers.

I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by
coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.

“I do.”

‘Too delicate and difficult a subject for such interference,’ I replied.

‘Is that all?’

In addition to these establishments, there are in New York, excellent
hospitals and schools, literary institutions and libraries; an admirable
fire department (as indeed it should be, having constant practice), and
charities of every sort and kind.  In the suburbs there is a spacious
cemetery: unfinished yet, but every day improving.  The saddest tomb I
saw there was ‘The Strangers’ Grave.  Dedicated to the different hotels
in this city.’

_Mrs. M._ Ha, ha! This is the end of it, you see. He frightened every
one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead.

‘No, no,’ cried the child, detaining him.  ‘Remember what you promised.
Our way is to the old green lane, where she and I so often were, and
where you found us, more than once, making those garlands for her
garden.  Do not turn back!’

The dwarf said never a word, but watched his companion as he paced
restlessly up and down the room, and presently returned to his seat.
Here he remained, with his head bowed upon his breast for some time, and
then suddenly raising it, said,

The way it came about was this. Having always been an early riser and
having now no organ to engage him in sweet converse every morning,
it was his habit to take a long walk before going to the Temple; and
naturally inclining, as a stranger, towards those parts of the town
which were conspicuous for the life and animation pervading them, he
became a great frequenter of the market-places, bridges, quays, and
especially the steam-boat wharves; for it was very lively and fresh
to see the people hurrying away upon their many schemes of business or
pleasure, and it made Tom glad to think that there was that much change
and freedom in the monotonous routine of city lives.

The gentle cheerfulness of Agnes went to all their hearts. Her quiet
interest in everything that interested Dora; her manner of making
acquaintance with Jip (who responded instantly); her pleasant way, when
Dora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me; her modest grace
and ease, eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence from
Dora; seemed to make our circle quite complete.

It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a
child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural
medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded
from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.
Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was
white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were
very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold
were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately
formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic
of the purest white; and round its waist was bound
a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held
a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular
contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed
with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,
that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear
jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was
doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a
great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.

The opinions of modern writers, as may be supposed, are divided on a
question so dark and mysterious. "Violent reports were propagated,"
says Hume, "as if Henry had been carried off by poison; but the
physicians, on opening his body, found no symptoms to confirm such
an opinion. The bold and criminal malignity of men's tongues and pens
spared not even the king on the occasion; but that prince's character
seems rather to have failed in the extreme of facility and humanity,
than in that of cruelty and violence." Hume's facts, it is notorious,
often assume the colouring of his political feelings; of which a pretty
strong instance occurs in this very case of Sir Thomas Overbury,
whose imprisonment in the Tower, says this historian, "James intended
as _a slight punishment for his disobedience_" in refusing to go as
ambassador to Russia. James ordered Overbury to be most rigorously
confined, and even sent a gentleman to the Tower for having simply
exchanged a word with the prisoner. Nay, more: James knew all along
that Overbury was languishing in his dungeon; having received, and
disregarded, repeated petitions from his afflicted father for his
release. And this, according to Hume, was intended by James as a slight
punishment for what was, in truth, no offence.

“Nothing like dissecting, to give one an appetite,” said Mr. Bob Sawyer,
looking round the table.

Her sight was fast failing her, and her hand groped over the bedclothes
in search of his. Brute as the man was, he was not prepared for this.
He turned his face from the bed, and sobbed. The girl’s colour changed,
and her breathing grew more difficult. She was evidently dying.

"HOT WITH!" shouted a manly voice from the eating-room, and Adeliza was
pained to think that in her presence her lover could eat so well.

“Damn you!” cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and
menacing the crowd. “Do your worst; I’ll cheat you yet!”

“Stand still a minute,” cried the voice; “I’ll be with you directly.”
With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.

And still she hid her face from Tom, and clasped him round the neck,
and wept for him, and poured out all her woman’s heart and soul in the
relief and pain of this disclosure.

‘Ah, run avay,’ said Mr. Weller, jumping up on the box. ‘Give my
compliments--Mr. Veller’s compliments--to the justice, and tell him I’ve
spiled his beadle, and that, if he’ll swear in a new ‘un, I’ll come back
again to-morrow and spile him. Drive on, old feller.’

On the appointed day came a communication with the L. and F. seal,
which I opened not without unprofessional eagerness. It was as follows:

Michael Warden, who had still been observant of Clemency, turned to Mr.
Snitchey, when he ceased to speak, and whispered in his ear.

‘Ha! you’re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!’
said the Jew, patting her on the neck. ‘It _was_ about Oliver I was
going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!’

‘This is the first class in English spelling and philosophy, Nickleby,’
said Squeers, beckoning Nicholas to stand beside him. ‘We’ll get up a
Latin one, and hand that over to you. Now, then, where’s the first boy?’

"Put 'em under the pump," suggested a hot-pieman.

While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin
sat in the old den--the same from which Oliver had been removed
by the girl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair
of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been
endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had
fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his
chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the
rusty bars.

"Ah, ah?" said Sam.

I soon felt convinced that I should work myself into one of my states
about the House; and I soon did.  I lived for a whole month in a flurry,
that was always getting worse.  Towers’s prescriptions, which I had
brought to London with me, were of no more use than nothing.  In the cold
winter sunlight, in the thick winter fog, in the black winter rain, in
the white winter snow, the House was equally on my mind.  I have heard,
as everybody else has, of a spirit’s haunting a house; but I have had my
own personal experience of a house’s haunting a spirit; for that House
haunted mine.

The evening came to an end at last, but Kate had yet to be handed
downstairs by the detested Sir Mulberry; and so skilfully were the
manoeuvres of Messrs Pyke and Pluck conducted, that she and the baronet
were the last of the party, and were even--without an appearance of
effort or design--left at some little distance behind.

I am The Boy at Mugby.  That’s about what _I_ am.

"Sam."

Mr Toots had discharged those words, as from a mortar, before he
observed Walter, whom he recognised with what may be described as a
chuckle of misery.

‘Hear, hear,’ assented Mr. Pell’s client. ‘Why shouldn’t he be?

“Lord bless you, sir!  Lots.”

When your Christmas letter did not arrive according to custom, I felt as
if a bit of Christmas had fallen out and there was no supplying the
piece. However, it was soon supplied by yourself, and the bowl became
round and sound again.

"Tom, you're come for," said the black fellow, gruffly. Tom shrank
back, but too late. He had left his little Bible at the bottom of his
coat-pocket and his big Bible on the desk buried under the mortgage
he was about to foreclose: never was sinner taken more unawares. The
black man whisked him like a child into the saddle, gave the horse the
lash, and away he galloped, with Tom on his back, in the midst of the
thunder-storm. The clerks stuck their pens behind their ears, and
stared after him from the windows. Away went Tom Walker, dashing down
the streets, his white cap bobbing up and down, his morning-gown
fluttering in the wind, and his steed striking fire out of the
pavement at every bound. When the clerks turned to look for the black
man, he had disappeared.

“Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,” said Blathers. “What
are the circumstances?”

With this preface, the two friends dived into some very complicated
accounts and vouchers, which, having been duly displayed and gone
through by Perker, were at once discharged by Mr. Pickwick with many
professions of esteem and friendship.

“Imagination,” said the gentleman, soothing her.

“Yes!” said Florence, eagerly.

MY DEAR WHITE,

And now we stood out to sea, in a most amazing manner; the Skipper
himself, the whole crew, the Uncommercial, and all hands present,
implicitly believing that there was not a moment to lose, that the wind
had that instant chopped round and sprung up fair, and that we were away
on a voyage round the world.  Get all sail upon her!  With a will, my
lads!  Lay out upon the main-yard there!  Look alive at the weather
earring!  Cheery, my boys!  Let go the sheet, now!  Stand by at the
braces, you!  With a will, aloft there!  Belay, starboard watch!  Fifer!
Come aft, fifer, and give ’em a tune!  Forthwith, springs up fifer, fife
in hand—smallest boy ever seen—big lump on temple, having lately fallen
down on a paving-stone—gives ’em a tune with all his might and main.
Hoo-roar, fifer!  With a will, my lads!  Tip ’em a livelier one, fifer!
Fifer tips ’em a livelier one, and excitement increases.  Shake ’em out,
my lads!  Well done!  There you have her!  Pretty, pretty!  Every rag
upon her she can carry, wind right astarn, and ship cutting through the
water fifteen knots an hour!

‘Yes, missus,’ returned Stephen, ‘it were me.’

"What! properties?" exclaimed that gentleman: "wonderful! you London
stars require a hundred things, where we country people are content
with one: however, whatever you want you shall have.--Here, Will, go
down to the market and buy a small pig, a goose, and two ducks. Mr.
Grimaldi wants some properties, and must have them."

A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star, because the mother
was re-united to her two children.  And he stretched out his arms and
cried, ‘O, mother, sister, and brother, I am here!  Take me!’  And they
answered him, ‘Not yet,’ and the star was shining.

‘Hush!’ said the gentleman who had spoken first. ‘You know you’ve
got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish,
don’t you?’

Divers birds sing here all day, and the nightingales all night. The
place is lovely, and in perfect order. I have put five mirrors in the
Swiss châlet (where I write) and they reflect and refract in all kinds
of ways the leaves that are quivering at the windows, and the great
fields of waving corn, and the sail-dotted river. My room is up among
the branches of the trees; and the birds and the butterflies fly in and
out, and the green branches shoot in, at the open windows, and the
lights and shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest of the
company. The scent of the flowers, and indeed of everything that is
growing for miles and miles, is most delicious.

[Sidenote: Mr. W. C. Macready]

‘I am so sure of it that I have promptly made up my mind to speak to
you.’

But, behold, there was laid before us certain evidence given at the
Coroner’s Inquest, holden on some of the men (who had obstinately died of
their treatment), and from that evidence it appeared that the beef was
the worst of possible beef!

"Hush!" replied the Dodger.  "Do you see that old cove at the
book-stall?"

My desk and I have just arisen from the floor.

“Take a good long “un, my lad!” replied the Captain, calling after him.
Walter waved his hand in assent, and went his way.

‘For the last time,’ he said.

"The rank is but the guinea's stamp,

Melmoth the Wanderer

Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of
his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either
side of the way as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place
he had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air
was impregnated with filthy odours. There were a good many small shops;
but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who,
even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or
screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to prosper amid
the general blight of the place were the public-houses, and in them,
the lowest orders of Irish (who are generally the lowest orders of
anything) were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards,
which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little
knots of houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing
in the filth; and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking
fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, upon no
very well-disposed or harmless errands.

“You called her Jenny, didn’t you? I’ll follow her. Bring those two
pair out here for a crown a man. Wake up, some of you!”

I send you the first four slips of No. 48, containing the description of
the locksmith's house, which I think will make a good subject, and one
you will like. If you put the "'prentice" in it, show nothing more than
his paper cap, because he will be an important character in the story,
and you will need to know more about him as he is minutely described. I
may as well say that he is very short. Should you wish to put the
locksmith in, you will find him described in No. 2 of "Barnaby" (which I
told Chapman and Hall to send you). Browne has done him in one little
thing, but so very slightly that you will not require to see his sketch,
I think.

Dr. Blimber's school was a great hot-house for the forcing of boy's
brains; and Dr. Blimber promised speedily to make a man of Paul.

Rumbling along with most unwonted noise, the caravan stopped at last at
the place of exhibition, where Nell dismounted amidst an admiring group
of children, who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the
curiosities, and were fully impressed with the belief that her
grandfather was a cunning device in wax.  The chests were taken out
with all convenient despatch, and taken in to be unlocked by Mrs
Jarley, who, attended by George and another man in velveteen shorts and
a drab hat ornamented with turnpike tickets, were waiting to dispose
their contents (consisting of red festoons and other ornamental devices
in upholstery work) to the best advantage in the decoration of the room.

“I see you were not,” said the stranger, an expression of quiet sarcasm
playing about his mouth, “or you would have known my name. You don’t
know it, and I should recommend you not to inquire.”

I hope to finish and get to town by next Wednesday night, the 19th; what
do you say to coming back with me on the following Tuesday? The interval
I propose to pass in a career of amiable dissipation and unbounded
license in the metropolis. If you will come and breakfast with me about
midnight--anywhere--any day, and go to bed no more until we fly to these
pastoral retreats, I shall be delighted to have so vicious an associate.

‘You’re a partner yourself, you know,’ returned my aunt, ‘and that’s
about enough for you, I expect. How do you find yourself, sir?’

‘“It’s not much trouble to open it, anyhow,” said Tom, getting out of
bed very deliberately. He walked up to one of the presses. The key was
in the lock; he turned it, and opened the door. There was a pair of
trousers there. He put his hand into the pocket, and drew forth the
identical letter the old gentleman had described!

Mr. Tupman no sooner heard this avowal, than he proceeded to do what his
enthusiastic emotions prompted, and what, for aught we know (for we are
but little acquainted with such matters), people so circumstanced always
do. He jumped up, and, throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster
aunt, imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses, which after a due show of
struggling and resistance, she received so passively, that there is no
telling how many more Mr. Tupman might have bestowed, if the lady had
not given a very unaffected start, and exclaimed in an affrighted tone--

"Well! and being there--how are you?" said Tackleton, in his cross way.

‘I meant to give you no offence,’ said Hugh. ‘I don’t know what to say.
You catch me up so very short.’

‘You might have given a worse opinion,’ said Mr Inspector, after brief
consideration. ‘Try it.’

“Is it of course?”

CHAPTER 57 -- How Ralph Nickleby's Auxiliary went about his Work, and how he prospered with it

"Who ever heard me address her in any way but that in which a lodger
would address his landlady?" continued Mr. Pickwick, with great
vehemence. "Who ever saw me with her? Not even my friends here----"

‘My dear Sir,’ said the good-humoured little doctor advancing with
extended hand, ‘I honour your gallantry. Permit me to say, Sir, that I
highly admire your conduct, and extremely regret having caused you the
inconvenience of this meeting, to no purpose.’

CHAPTER XLIX.
           -"waived" changed to "waved"

“Certainly not, Sir Leicester,”

Here she stood, for a few moments, quite transfixed with terror at the
sight of Mr Quilp, who was hanging so far out of bed that he almost
seemed to be standing on his head, and who, either from the uneasiness
of this posture, or in one of his agreeable habits, was gasping and
growling with his mouth wide open, and the whites (or rather the dirty
yellows) of his eyes distinctly visible.  It was no time, however, to
ask whether anything ailed him; so, possessing herself of the key after
one hasty glance about the room, and repassing the prostrate Mr Brass,
she rejoined the old man in safety.  They got the door open without
noise, and passing into the street, stood still.

_Mr. Samuel Pickwick._

On Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two hundred and
fourteen, the King came from Windsor Castle, and the Barons came from
the town of Staines, and they met on Runny-Mead, which is still a
pleasant meadow by the Thames, where rushes grow in the clear water of
the winding river, and its banks are green with grass and trees. On the
side of the Barons, came the General of their army, Robert Fitz-Walter,
and a great concourse of the nobility of England. With the King, came,
in all, some four-and-twenty persons of any note, most of whom despised
him, and were merely his advisers in form. On that great day, and in
that great company, the King signed Magna Charta—the great charter of
England—by which he pledged himself to maintain the Church in its
rights; to relieve the Barons of oppressive obligations as vassals of
the Crown—of which the Barons, in their turn, pledged themselves to
relieve _their_ vassals, the people; to respect the liberties of London
and all other cities and boroughs; to protect foreign merchants who
came to England; to imprison no man without a fair trial; and to sell,
delay, or deny justice to none. As the Barons knew his falsehood well,
they further required, as their securities, that he should send out of
his kingdom all his foreign troops; that for two months they should
hold possession of the city of London, and Stephen Langton of the
Tower; and that five-and-twenty of their body, chosen by themselves,
should be a lawful committee to watch the keeping of the charter, and
to make war upon him if he broke it.

‘Perfectly, sir.’

“I know I ain’t as cunning as you are,” replied Charlotte; “but don’t
put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You
would have been if I had been, any way.”

She took his arm and they hurried through the village street. It was
the same as it was wont to be in old times, yet different too, and wore
another air. The change was in herself, not it; but she never thought of
that, and wondered at its alteration, and where it lay, and what it was.

I administered the cordial.  I placed food before him, and this
time he did not eat with repugnance.  I poured out wine, and he
drank it sparingly, but with ready compliance, saying, "In perfect
health, I looked upon wine as poison; now it is like a foretaste of
the glorious elixir."

‘Oh! Investments,’ said Pancks. ‘Ay, ay! I didn’t know you were speaking
of investments.’

‘There!’ cried Uriah, shaking his head. ‘What a melancholy confirmation:
ain’t it? Him! Such an old friend! Bless your soul, when I was nothing
but a clerk in his office, Copperfield, I’ve seen him twenty times, if
I’ve seen him once, quite in a taking about it--quite put out, you know
(and very proper in him as a father; I’m sure I can’t blame him), to
think that Miss Agnes was mixing herself up with what oughtn’t to be.’

In young and passionate days she had often thought of seeking that way
out of life's agonies, but at its worst there is always some sweetness
left in the cup--when one is young! It was not so now. The dregs only
had been hers for many a year, and she had enough. Death--yes, that was
best.

The end was drawing on; the golden bowl was breaking; the silver
cord was fast being loosed--that _animula, blandula, vagula, hospes,
comesque_, was about to flee. The body and the soul--companions for
sixty years--were being sundered and taking leave. She was walking,
alone, through the valley of that shadow into which one day we must
all enter--and yet she was not alone, for we know whose rod and staff
were comforting her.

The nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment, for in a
moment I saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed, and
that there was a little group of other men, standing at a short
distance, to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he made.
The Danger-light was not yet lighted.  Against its shaft, a little
low hut, entirely new to me, had been made of some wooden supports
and tarpaulin.  It looked no bigger than a bed.

I do not, of course, mean to intimate that my feeling for Bourgonef
was of that deep kind which justifies the name of friendship.  I
only want to say that in our social relations we are constantly
hiding from each other, under the smiles and courtesies of friendly
interest, thoughts which, if expressed, would destroy all possible
communion--and that, nevertheless, we are not insincere in our
smiles and courtesies; and therefore there is nothing paradoxical
in my having felt great admiration for Bourgonef, and great
pleasure in his society, while all the time there was deep down in
the recesses of my thoughts an uneasy sense of a dark mystery which
possibly connected him with a dreadful crime.

They waited, but the schoolmaster cast no look towards them, and still
sat, thoughtful and silent, in the little porch.  He had a kind face.
In his plain old suit of black, he looked pale and meagre.  They
fancied, too, a lonely air about him and his house, but perhaps that
was because the other people formed a merry company upon the green, and
he seemed the only solitary man in all the place.

‘I remember days when I was afraid of being mad; when I used to start
from my sleep, and fall upon my knees, and pray to be spared from the
curse of my race; when I rushed from the sight of merriment or
happiness, to hide myself in some lonely place, and spend the weary
hours in watching the progress of the fever that was to consume my
brain. I knew that madness was mixed up with my very blood, and the
marrow of my bones! that one generation had passed away without the
pestilence appearing among them, and that I was the first in whom it
would revive. I knew it must be so: that so it always had been, and so
it ever would be: and when I cowered in some obscure corner of a crowded
room, and saw men whisper, and point, and turn their eyes towards me, I
knew they were telling each other of the doomed madman; and I slunk away
again to mope in solitude.

‘What do they mean by this?’ inquired Mr. Joseph Tuggs, thoroughly out
of temper.

"Not in love!" cried Snitchey.

‘To be sure,’ said Toby.  ‘To be sure!  I don’t know what I’m rambling on
about, to-night.  My wits are wool-gathering, I think.  Will Fern, you
come along with me.  You’re tired to death, and broken down for want of
rest.  You come along with me.’  The man still played with the child’s
curls, still leaned upon Meg’s chair, still turned away his face.  He
didn’t speak, but in his rough coarse fingers, clenching and expanding in
the fair hair of the child, there was an eloquence that said enough.

[Illustration: "WHAT A COMICAL BROTHER-IN-LAW YOU ARE!"--Book 2, chap.
iii.]

‘Why it was only last night, sir,’ whispered Kit’s mother, ‘that I left
him in Little Bethel.’

Mr. Tulrumble, junior, couldn’t make up his mind to be anything but
magnificent, so he went up to London and drew bills on his father; and
when he had overdrawn, and got into debt, he grew penitent, and came home
again.

The Germans who were on board ate and drank heartily, and wanted me
to get up and shave. I thought that the chance of being drowned was
enough, without the certainty of cutting my throat from ear to ear,
which I should inevitably have done if I had attempted to use a razor in
the state of the vessel's movements. They endeavoured to get me up, by
touching my national pride.

I wonder what the foreman of the jury, whoever he’ll be, has got for
breakfast,’ said Mr. Snodgrass, by way of keeping up a conversation on
the eventful morning of the fourteenth of February.

‘I—I—am a stranger, and don’t know the way. I—I—want to find the
place where I can see what is described here. It is possible I may know
it.’ He was panting, and could hardly speak; but, he showed a copy of
the newly-printed bill that was still wet upon the wall. Perhaps its
newness, or perhaps the accuracy of his observation of its general look,
guided Gaffer to a ready conclusion.

“So you see, sir,” pursued old Philip, whose hale wintry cheek had warmed
into a ruddier glow, and whose blue eyes had brightened while he spoke,
“I have plenty to keep, when I keep this present season. Now, where’s my
quiet Mouse? Chattering’s the sin of my time of life, and there’s half
the building to do yet, if the cold don’t freeze us first, or the wind
don’t blow us away, or the darkness don’t swallow us up.”

I shook my head.

        General Index.

"Most secret and confidential.

|‘The second murder occurred on the same night. About eleven o’clock the
Limerick mail was stopped by a numerous banditti, and a gentleman was
slaughtered under circumstances which elicited a lively sympathy. The
sufferer was Lieutenant William Giffard, of the 82nd regiment, son of
Captain John Giffard of the Dublin regiment.’ The savages having shot
one of the horses so effectually to prevent the coach from proceeding,
demanded of Lieutenant Giffard who and what he was, to which he
answered, without hesitation, that he was an officer proceeding to
Chatham in obedience to orders he had received. They demanded whether
he was a Protestant; and being answered in the affirmative, they held a
moment’s consultation, and then told him that they wanted officers, that
if he would take an oath to be true to them, and join them in an
attack to be made next morning upon Monastereven, they would give him
a command, but that otherwise he must die. To this the gallant youth
replied, ‘That he had already sworn allegiance to the king, that he
would never offend God Almighty by a breach of that oath, nor would he
disgrace himself by turning a deserter and joining the king’s enemies;
that he could not suppose a body of men would be so cruel as to murder
an individual who had never injured them, and who was merely passing
through them to a country from whence possibly he never might return;
but if they insisted on their proposal he must die, for he never would
consent to it!’ This heroic answer, which would have kindled sentiments
of humanity in any breasts but those of Irish rebels, had the contrary
effect, and with the utmost fury they assaulted him. He had a case
of pistols, which natural courage and love of life, though hopeless,
prompted him to use with effect, and being uncommonly active he burst
from them, vaulted over a six feet wall, and made towards a house where
he saw a light and heard people talking. Alas! it afforded no refuge! It
was the house of poor Crawford whom, with his grand-daughter, they
had just piked. A band of barbarians returning from this exploit met
Lieutenant Giffard. There he fell, covered with wounds and glory, and
his mangled body was thrown into the same ditch with honest Crawford and
his innocent grandchild.

There is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling
snowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so
hopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that
I give up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The
despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other, as I blunder
on, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect in these miserable
lessons is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries
to give me the cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss
Murdstone, who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along, says
in a deep warning voice:

‘Miss Witherfield,’ said Mr. Magnus, ‘allow me to introduce my very
particular friend, Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Pickwick, I beg to make you known
to Miss Witherfield.’

I never did in my days behold anything like Mowcher as she stood upon
the dining table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at
Steerforth’s head, and winking at me over it.

‘I was cautioned not to stay there, and so I left the town at once,
and since then I have changed about. I have been doing odds and ends at
Avignon, at Pont Esprit, at Lyons; upon the Rhone, upon the Saone.’ As
he spoke, he rapidly mapped the places out with his sunburnt hand upon
the floor.

At last Mr. and Miss Murdstone arrived. To Miss Betsy's great
indignation, Miss Murdstone rode a donkey across the green in front of
the house, and stopped at the gate. Nothing made Miss Trotwood so angry
as to see donkeys on that green, and I had already seen several battles
between my aunt or Janet and the donkey boys.

Then after the party came the leave-takings, for Paul was going home.
And every one was good to him--even the pompous doctor, and
Cornelia--and bade him good-bye with many regrets; for they were afraid,
as they looked upon his pinched, wan face, that he would not be able to
come back and take up that load of heavy books ever again.

“Well,” said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.

"It's a curious coincidence," said I.

Slackbridge laughed, folded his arms, and frowned sarcastically.

FATAL CONSEQUENCES.

You will believe my congratulations on the delicacy and talent of your
writing to be sincere. From the first, I have always had an especial
interest in that Miss Berwick, and have over and over again questioned
Wills about her. I suppose he has gone on gradually building up an
imaginary structure of life and adventure for her, but he has given me
the strangest information! Only yesterday week, when we were "making up"
"The Poor Travellers," as I sat meditatively poking the office fire, I
said to him, "Wills, have you got that Miss Berwick's proof back, of the
little sailor's song?" "No," he said. "Well, but why not?" I asked him.
"Why, you know," he answered, "as I have often told you before, she
don't live at the place to which her letters are addressed, and so
there's always difficulty and delay in communicating with her." "Do you
know what age she is?" I said. Here he looked unfathomably profound, and
returned, "Rather advanced in life." "You said she was a governess,
didn't you?" said I; to which he replied in the most emphatic and
positive manner, "A governess."

‘I was his wife, my dear.’

‘This is affecting!’ said Mr. Lenville, looking round him, and drawing
the back of his hand across his eyes. ‘The ties of nature are strong.
The weak husband and the father--the father that is yet to be--relents.
I apologise.’

Sam interchanged a smile with the housekeeper, and proceeded:

"Very well," said Colonel Berkeley, "then we will consider the matter
settled. As soon as you have done here, you must come to Cheltenham for
one night. I will make all necessary arrangements with Farley: your son
shall play the Green Knight, and I will give you one hundred pounds as
a remuneration. We will try what we can do together, Joe, to amuse the
people."

‘Oh, yes, I did!’ replied Mr. Tupman; ‘repeat them. If you would have me
recover, repeat them.’

‘It is not much; but since you told me of the lady who gave you the
bracelet, Fanny--’

‘No offence. Oh no offence!’ said the old man.

Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and
laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent,
and to get to work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern,
and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with
his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his
knees, so as to make a step of his back. This was no sooner done,
than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver gently through the window
with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar,
planted him safely on the floor inside.

‘Miss Louisa, I said I didn’t know.  I thought I couldn’t know whether it
was a prosperous nation or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or
not, unless I knew who had got the money, and whether any of it was mine.
But that had nothing to do with it.  It was not in the figures at all,’
said Sissy, wiping her eyes.

‘Always so much older, so much rougher, and so much less worthy, even
what I was must be dismissed by both of us, and you must see me only as
I am. I put this parting kiss upon your cheek, my child--who might have
been more near to me, who never could have been more dear--a ruined man
far removed from you, for ever separated from you, whose course is
run while yours is but beginning. I have not the courage to ask to be
forgotten by you in my humiliation; but I ask to be remembered only as I
am.’

Judgment must go by default. I have not a word to plead against Dodson
and Fogg. I am without any defence to the action; and therefore, as law
goes, ought to win it.

These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden
goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while
the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob
proposed:

‘It looks as if the old man’s spirit had found rest at last; don’t it?’
said Mrs Boffin.

Mr. Pickwick, perceiving that there was some embarrassment on the old
gentleman's part, affected to be engaged in cutting the leaves of a
book that lay beside him, and waited patiently until Mr. Weller should
arrive at the object of his visit.

“The will,” said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, “was in the same
spirit as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought
upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature
bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and
left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The
bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions—one for Agnes
Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and
ever come of age. If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money
unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his
minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of
dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. He did this, he said, to mark
his confidence in the mother, and his conviction—only strengthened by
approaching death—that the child would share her gentle heart, and
noble nature. If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the
money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both
children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his
purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed
him with coldness and aversion.”

“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when he
had surveyed me at his leisure. “It will take a little time. Perhaps we
had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my
communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you
please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”

While Joe was absent on this errand, the elder Willet and his three
companions continued to smoke with profound gravity, and in a deep
silence, each having his eyes fixed on a huge copper boiler that was
suspended over the fire. After some time John Willet slowly shook his
head, and thereupon his friends slowly shook theirs; but no man withdrew
his eyes from the boiler, or altered the solemn expression of his
countenance in the slightest degree.

‘There! Never mind the sister,’ remarked Mrs Merdle, a little
impatiently. ‘What did the brother say?’

"Bless your heart and soul, sir!" replied Ned, "you might as well ask me
to wear a seventy-four pounder, or a cast-iron boiler."

I promise that she shall, immediately; but I cannot leave her, for my
grief.

“Don’t lose your temper,” said Joe.

"It must have been the cat, Sarah," said the girl, addressing herself
to some one in the house. "Puss, puss, puss,--tit, tit, tit."

“Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the
answer in great trouble, and very slowly.

Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs
of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to
feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any
conversation with her at present. With the view of diverting the
attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.

Once more opening his mouth and shutting his eyes, and laughing like a
stentor, Kit gradually backed to the door, and roared himself out.

The simple father was beginning to submit that he hoped his son, the
quondam Grinder, huffed and cuffed, and flogged and badged, and taught,
as parrots are, by a brute jobbed into his place of schoolmaster with
as much fitness for it as a hound, might not have been educated on
quite a right plan in some undiscovered respect, when Mr Dombey angrily
repeating “The usual return!” led the Major away. And the Major being
heavy to hoist into Mr Dombey’s carriage, elevated in mid-air, and
having to stop and swear that he would flay the Native alive, and break
every bone in his skin, and visit other physical torments upon him,
every time he couldn’t get his foot on the step, and fell back on that
dark exile, had barely time before they started to repeat hoarsely that
it would never do: that it always failed: and that if he were to
educate “his own vagabond,” he would certainly be hanged.

"I think, Sir," observed Mr. Snitchey, gravely addressing himself to his
partner, "that of all the scrapes Mr. Warden's horses have brought him
into at one time and another--and they have been pretty numerous, and
pretty expensive, as none know better than himself and you and I--the
worst scrape may turn out to be, if he talks in this way, his having
been ever left by one of them at the Doctor's garden wall, with three
broken ribs, a snapped collar-bone, and the Lord knows how many bruises.
We didn't think so much of it, at the time when we knew he was going on
well under the Doctor's hands and roof; but it looks bad now, Sir. Bad!
It looks very bad. Doctor Jeddler too--our client, Mr. Craggs."

“Will you take any other vegetables? Grass? Peas? Summer cabbage?”

_Bob._ And I know, I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient
and how mild he was--although he was a little child--we shall not
quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.

"Nothing!" exclaimed Mrs. Markleham. "Me, nothing! The child has taken
leave of her senses. Please to get me a glass of water!"

There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on
the other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong
inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as the injured men of
Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic.  But he
preserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone
balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little
surface-island.

Mr. Calton resumed; ‘I am placed, Mr. Tibbs, in rather an unpleasant
situation.’

“Then you don’t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will
soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be
laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round
of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my
cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”

CHAPTER 43

‘That’s a pious boy! Now again:—You were always—’

‘Sir!’

‘I thought I knew the step,’ she answered, hesitating.

"Keep quiet, you warmint! keep quiet!" said Mr. Sikes, suddenly
breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be
disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought
upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable
from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for
argument and consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a
kick and a curse bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.

“Is—is—must be somewhere,” pursued Richard impetuously, “and must
be brought out. To allow Ada to be made a bribe and hush-money of is
not the way to bring it out. You say the suit is changing me; John
Jarndyce says it changes, has changed, and will change everybody who
has any share in it. Then the greater right I have on my side when I
resolve to do all I can to bring it to an end.”

‘Perform--business!’ said Master Belling. ‘Never--perform--business!’

The woman let fall her veil, moved from me, and seated herself on a
crag above that cleft between mountain and creek, to which, when I
had first discovered the gold that the land nourished, the rain
from the clouds had given the rushing life of the cataract; but
which now, in the drought and the hush of the skies, was but a dead
pile of stones.

‘And what are the probabilities as to the result of the contest?’
inquired Mr. Pickwick.

GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER,
                                             _Monday, Aug. 3rd, 1857._

Bonaparte, Napoleon, 121.

“I am very sorry, my good Fanny,” said Isabel, “that just now I have no
money. A charitable gentleman sends you five shillings, and as soon as I
possibly can, I will let you have a large sum. I have not yet paid for
the carriage I sent you, and as the bill has been given me several
times, I must discharge it before I send away more money. I hope that by
this time, little Bella is better.”

She seemed flurried, and she held out both her little hands to me in an
appealing kind of way, as if she were afraid of my detaining her against
her will.  I took them both into mine, pressing them with rather more
ardour than was quite necessary.

"Boots withdrew in search of the required restorative, and, when he
brought it in, the gentleman handed it to the lady, and fed her with a
spoon, and took a little himself. The lady being heavy with sleep, and
rather cross. 'What should you think, sir,' says Cobbs, 'of a chamber
candlestick?' The gentleman approved; the chambermaid went first, up the
great staircase; the lady, in her sky-blue mantle, followed, gallantly
led by the gentleman; the gentleman kissed her at the door, and retired
to his own room, where Boots softly locked him up.

No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce
Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her own conveyance home. Jumping
out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and handing Mrs.
Rouncewell up the steps, the old girl shakes hands and trudges off,
arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and
falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened.

"Yes, for my nephew," said my aunt.

"No, she won't, Fagin," bawled Nancy.

‘No one can have loved him better, no one can hold him in dearer
remembrance than I,’ I replied. ‘I meant to say, if you have no
compassion for his mother; or if his faults--you have been bitter on
them--’

‘You’ve been a long time,’ said Ralph, when Newman returned.

Young Merchants, Putnam & Sons, publishers.

"Not the man I know?"

[Sidenote: Miss Hogarth.]

‘Mr. Nathaniel Winkle,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

"'Not as a grandmamma, Cobbs?'

"Your news," observed the vizier, "was partly right, and partly false.
That a change has taken place in the government of this country," said
he, "is true; and our minister's words are confirmed. A change has
taken place; but change does not argue total destruction."

Boz himself would have been pleased to find himself quoted in two
impressive legal tomes of some 1800 pages.  The great and laborious John
Pitt Taylor could not have been wholly a legal dry-as-dust: for the man
who could have gravely entered Bardell _v._ Pickwick in his notes and
have quoted a passage must have had a share of humour.

"Twhit-twhit!" gs the boatswain's call, followed by a voice like a
distant thunderclap, "Hammocks ahoy!" and away flies every man to the
nettings; but not a lashing is touched till the whole have found owners,
(the occupation of a minute,) when the first lieutenant's "Pipe down!"
draws forth a lark-like chirping of the calls, and in a few seconds the
whole have disappeared; even the hammock-men to the young gentlemen have
fetched their duplicate, and the cloths are rolled up for the night. The
gallant Nelson had his coffin publicly exhibited in his cabin; but what
of that? the seaman constantly sleeps in his coffin, for such is his
hammock should he die at sea.

After two or three turns across the room he resumed his seat, and
drawing his chair nearer to that on which Nicholas was seated, said:

Having delivered this little summary, Mr Podsnap’s face flushed, as he
thought of the remote possibility of its being at all qualified by
any prejudiced citizen of any other country; and, with his favourite
right-arm flourish, he put the rest of Europe and the whole of Asia,
Africa, and America nowhere.

‘Yes, he is a very young man,’ replied the attorney. ‘He was only called
the other day. Let me see--he has not been at the Bar eight years yet.’

“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face. “Don’t you see?
It’s _him_!”

Mr. Pickwick coughed.

"'Death and nouns!' says I, 'is this Mr. Magan?'

[[[JOHN SHEARES’ BLOODTHIRSTY MANIFESTO]]]

III.

‘How old was Becky Morgan?’ asked the sexton.

‘Didn’t see it?’ returned the man.

“Well,--as for looks, I cannot say. It’s so long since I first knowed
her, that I’ve clean forgotten what I thought of her then. My master
says he never saw such a smile for gladdening the heart. But maybe it’s
not looks you’re asking about. The best thing I can say of her looks is,
that she’s just one a stranger would stop in the street to ask help from
if you needed it. All the little childer creeps as close as they can to
her; she’ll have as many as three or four hanging to her apron all at
once.”

"It was cowardice," he said, "sheer cowardice!  After all that has
happened, I dared not have a quarrel with one of my own blood.  And
yet if I had not hardened my heart, I had reason to know what I was
risking."

"It's the man I spoke to you about," said Mr. Pickwick, "I sent for
him to the Borough this morning. Have the goodness to call him up,
Snodgrass."

I am most truly obliged to you for your kind and ready help.

A significant turn of the Spanish fan towards Fanny’s bosom, indicated
with great expression where one of these people was to be found.

"I am not breaking a rash vow, Richard.  These are not Mary Marshall's
lips that speak.  I have another name."

‘Yes, Sir.’

So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey
the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth,
because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said.
He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the
light of a candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a
gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand,
who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better.

‘But it must be made,’ thought Tom, ‘sooner or later; and I had better
get it over.’

One day, when Private Richard Doubledick came out of the Black hole,
where he had been passing the last eight and forty hours, and in which
retreat he spent a good deal of his time, he was ordered to betake
himself to Captain Taunton's quarters. In the stale and squalid state of
a man just out of the Black hole, he had less fancy than ever for being
seen by the Captain; but he was not so mad yet as to disobey orders, and
consequently went up to the terrace overlooking the parade-ground, where
the officers' quarters were; twisting and breaking in his hands, as he
went along, a bit of the straw that had formed the decorative furniture
of the Black hole.

"Bah! stuff and nonsense!" said my aunt. "Don't talk to me!"

AN INTERPOLATION.

‘Who dares apprehend me?’ said Mr. Tupman.

I have said that retirement has become a habit with me.  When I add, that
the deaf gentleman and I have two friends, I communicate nothing which is
inconsistent with that declaration.  I spend many hours of every day in
solitude and study, have no friends or change of friends but these, only
see them at stated periods, and am supposed to be of a retired spirit by
the very nature and object of our association.

The captain, instead of paying that rapt attention to his steward which
was rendered by the other three persons present, went to Church again, in
respect of the steward's hat.  And a most especially agitated and
memorable face the captain produced from it, after a short pause.

"Knew what, my dear?"

Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard,
the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.

‘I don’t know’ returned Mr Swiveller.  ‘Towards Highgate, I suppose.
Perhaps the bells might strike up “Turn again Swiveller, Lord Mayor of
London.” Whittington’s name was Dick.  I wish cats were scarcer.’

As the little man concluded, he took an emphatic pinch of snuff, as a
tribute to the smartness of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg.

In great haste, ever cordially.

"Now strip thee, Master Marsh, and that quickly: untruss, I say!
discard thy boots, doff doublet and hose, and place thyself
incontinent in yonder bath." The visitor cast his eyes again upon the
formidable-looking article, and perceived that it was nearly filled
with water. A cold bath, at such an hour and under such auspices, was
anything but inviting: he hesitated, and turned his eyes alternately on
the Doctor and the Black Cat.

What with Blondin at the Crystal Palace and Léotard at Leicester Square,
we seem to be going back to barbaric excitements. I have not seen, and
don't intend to see, the Hero of Niagara (as the posters call him), but
I have been beguiled into seeing Léotard, and it is at once the most
fearful and most graceful thing I have ever seen done.

"Are you composed enough," said I, "to speak on the subject which so
interested you--I hope Heaven may remember it!--that snowy night?"

"Where was I?" inquired Bob thoughtfully: "oh, now I recollect;--down
in the cabin, going to sign the articles. 'Are you quite ready?' says
the skipper to me as he raised the pen. 'All ready,' says I.--'Then
hould up,' says he to the young lady, and she raised her fair arm. 'Come
here, my man,' says he again to me, and I clapped him close alongside
at the table; 'be ready to grab hould o' the pen in a moment, and make
your mark _there_,' and he pointed to a spot on the parchment, with a
brimstone seal stamped again it--you might have smelt it, messmates,
for half a league--and, I'm blessed if I didn't have a fit o' the
doldrums; but, nevertheless, I put a bould face upon it, and, 'Happy
go lucky,' says I, 'all's one to Bob!' and then there was another
rustling noise down the leg of his trousers, and his eye--that's his
onkivered one--flashed again, and took to rolling out sparks like a
flint-mill; 'Listen, my man,' says he, 'to what I'm going to say,
and pay strict attention to it'--'I wool, your honour,' says I; 'but
hadn't the lady better put down her arm?' says I; 'it ull make it ache,
keeping it up so long.'--'Mind your own business, Bob Martingal,'
says he, quite cantankerously; 'she's houlding the inkstand.'--'Who's
cracking now, your honour?' says I laughing; 'the lady arn't got not
nothing whatsomever in her hand. I'm blowed if I don't think you all
carries out the name o' the craft In-fun-oh.'--'Right,' says he; 'and
now attend. If after I have dipt this here pen in the ink, you refuse
to sign the articles--you have heard o' this?' and he touched the
black patch. I gave a devil-may-care sort of a nod. 'Well, then, if
you refuses to sign, I'll nillyate you.'--'Never fear,' says I, making
out to be as bould as a lion, for there was ounly he and I men-folk
in the cabin; and, thinks I to myself, 'I'm a match for him singly at
any rate.'--'You're mistaken,' says he, 'and you'll find it out to
your cost, if you don't mind your behaviour, Bob Martingal.'--'I never
opened my lips, your honour,' says I.--'Take care you don't,' says he,
'and be sure to obey orders.' He turned to the lady. 'Are you prepared,
Marian?' axes he; but she never spoke. 'She's faint, your honour,' says
I, 'God bless her!' The spiteful wretch give me a red-hot look, and
his d---- oncivil cloven foot--for I'd swear to the mark it made--came
crushing on my toes, and made me sing out blue blazes. 'Is that obeying
orders?' says he: 'didn't I command you never to use that name afore
me?'--'You did, your honour,' says I; 'but you might have kept your
hoof off my toes, seeing as I haven't yet signed articles.'--'It was
an accident,' says he, 'and here's something to buy a plaster;' and he
throws down a couple of doubloons, which I claps into my pocket. 'You
enter woluntarily into my service, then?' says he.--'To be sure I do,'
says I, though I'm blessed if I wouldn't have given a treble pork-piece
to have been on shore again.--'And you'll make your mark to that?'
says he, 'and ax no further questions?'--'To be sure I will,' says I;
and I'll just tell you what it is, messmates, I'm blowed if ever I was
more harder up in my life than when I seed him raise the pen, as looked
like a sharp lanchet, in his infernal thieving-hooks, and job it right
into that beautiful arm, and the blood spun out, and the lady gave a
skreek; and 'Sign--sign!' says he; 'quick, my man--your mark!'--'No,
I'm d--if I do,' says I; 'let blood be on them as sheds it.'--'You
won't?' says he.--'Never, you spawn o' Bellzebub!' says I; for I'd
found him out, shipmates.--'Then take the consequences,' says he; and
up went the black patch, and, by the Lord Harry! he sported an eye that
nobody never seed the like on in their lives; it looked as big and as
glaring as one o' them red glass bottles of a night-time as stands in
the potecarry's windows with a lamp behind 'em; but it was ten thousand
times more brilliant than the fiercest furnace that ever blazed,--you
couldn't look upon it for a moment; and I felt a burning heat in my
heart and in my stomach, as if I'd swallowed a pint of vitriol; and my
strength was going away and I was withering to a hatomy, when all at
once I recollects a charm as my ould mother hung round my neck when I
was a babby, and I snatches it off and houlds it out at arm's length
right in his very face. My precious eyes and limbs! how he did but caper
about the cabin, till his hat fell off, and there was his two fore-tack
bumkins reg'larly shipped over his bows and standing up with a bit of a
twist outwards just like the head-gear of a billy-goat. 'Keep off, you
bitch's babby!' says I, for he tried onknown schemes and manoeuvres
to get at me; till suddenly I hears a loud ripping of stitches, and
away went the casings of his lower stancheons, and out came a tail as
long----"

Montague gave him the paper. After pausing as if he could not make up
his mind to put his name to it, Jonas dipped his pen hastily in the
nearest inkstand, and began to write. But he had scarcely marked the
paper when he started back, in a panic.

"Oh, quite gone! Quite gone!" said the little woman, waving him
hurriedly away. "Good night!"

“However that may be, my dear,” returned the lady, “your misfortune is
a lighter one than Florence’s; for not an orphan in the wide world can
be so deserted as the child who is an outcast from a living parent’s
love.”

Entertaining these feelings on the subject of knockers, it will be
readily imagined with what consternation we viewed the entire removal
of the knocker from the door of the next house to the one we lived in,
some time ago, and the substitution of a bell. This was a calamity we
had never anticipated. The bare idea of anybody being able to exist
without a knocker, appeared so wild and visionary, that it had never
for one instant entered our imagination.

The young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of
experience. Mrs. Rouncewell listens.

‘I fear your kind and open communication, which has rendered me more
painfully conscious of my own defects, has not improved me,’ sighed
Kate.

We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,

VI.

Firebras and the others, with the exception of Randulph, drew off.

"Certainly, sir, certainly,--fifty more if you like to hear
'em--strange life mine--rather curious history--not extraordinary, but
singular."

"You see there are only a few gentlemen--not enough to go round--and
that makes them count so!" It had thrust the girl herself, for that
matter, into depths; but whether most of memory or of roused purpose
he had no time to judge--aware as he suddenly was of a shadow (since
he mightn't perhaps too quickly call it a light) across the heaving
surface of their question. It fell upon Julia's face, fell with the
sound of the voice he so well knew, but which could only be odd to her
for all it immediately assumed.

Stephen looked older, but he had had a hard life.  It is said that every
life has its roses and thorns; there seemed, however, to have been a
misadventure or mistake in Stephen’s case, whereby somebody else had
become possessed of his roses, and he had become possessed of the same
somebody else’s thorns in addition to his own.  He had known, to use his
words, a peck of trouble.  He was usually called Old Stephen, in a kind
of rough homage to the fact.

I have not come across any English whom I know except Layard and the
Emerson Tennents, who will be here on Thursday from Civita Vecchia, and
are to dine with us. The losses up to this point have been two pairs of
shoes (one mine and one Egg's), Collins's snuff-box, and Egg's
dressing-gown.

The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,
with more decision, “It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
can’t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my
office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,
I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate
here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with
me?”

About this time, it began to be murmured in Mudfog that Nicholas
Tulrumble was growing vain and haughty; that prosperity and success
had corrupted the simplicity of his manners, and tainted the natural
goodness of his heart; in short, that he was setting up for a public
character, and a great gentleman, and affected to look down upon his
old companions with compassion and contempt. Whether these reports were
at the time well-founded, or not, certain it is that Mrs. Tulrumble
very shortly afterwards started a four-wheel chaise, driven by a tall
postilion in a yellow cap,--that Mr. Tulrumble junior took to smoking
cigars, and calling the footman a "feller,"--and that Mr. Tulrumble from
that time forth, was no more seen in his old seat in the chimney-corner
of the Lighterman's Arms at night. This looked bad; but, more than
this, it began to be observed that Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble attended the
corporation meetings more frequently than heretofore; that he no longer
went to sleep as he had done for so many years, but propped his eyelids
open with his two fore-fingers; that he read the newspapers by himself
at home; and that he was in the habit of indulging abroad in distant
and mysterious allusions to "masses of people," and "the property of
the country," and "productive power," and "the monied interest:" all
of which denoted and proved that Nicholas Tulrumble was either mad, or
worse; and it puzzled the good people of Mudfog amazingly.

"If," said the Bride of the Pirate-Colonel, "grown-up people WON'T do
what they ought to do, and WILL put us out, what comes of our
pretending?"

“Dear boy,” he said, as I sat down by his bed: “I thought you was late.
But I knowed you couldn’t be that.”

Mr. Pickwick thrust his head out of his window. Yes: there was a chaise-
and-four, a short distance before them, dashing along at full gallop.

With that he returns to finish his dinner with a good appetite, and
after a light nap, is summoned into the drawing-room. Sir Leicester
has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he
has anything to report. The debilitated cousin (much exhausted by the
funeral) and Volumnia are in attendance.

‘What have you there, Sam?’

‘’Tis the poor craythur that stays here, sur; and ’tis very bad she is,
and ’tis very bad she’s been this long time, and ’tis better she’ll never
be, and ’tis slape she does all day, and ’tis wake she does all night,
and ’tis the lead, sur.’

‘Signifying in Quod, Miss? Perhaps not. But he may have merited it. He
may be suspected of far worse than ever I was.’

There was no impatience in the pleasant look with which Mr. Crisparkle
contemplated the pretty old piece of china as it knitted; but there
was, certainly, a humorous sense of its not being a piece of china to
argue with very closely.

"Don't you think, if I had had her for a friend a long time ago, Doady,"
said Dora, her bright eyes shining very brightly, and her little right
hand idly busying itself with one of the buttons of my coat, "I might
have been more clever perhaps?"

‘I need scarcely tell you, after what you have just seen, that I
have nothing to bestow upon your friend Mr Slyme. And it is quite as
unnecessary for me to tell you that I don’t desire the honour of your
company.’

This was a double-barrelled compliment. It implied that Mrs. Weller was
a most agreeable female, and also that Mr. Stiggins had a clerical
appearance. It made a visible impression at once; and Sam followed up
his advantage by kissing his mother-in-law.

"So I expect," he answered, with a sigh.

She bent her ear to the bed, and listened: at the same time looking
round at the bystanders, and holding up her finger.

‘Miss Julia, shall I assist you to some fish?’

Jeff was the very prince of hosts. He made haste to make Pete feel at
home.

"You didn't seem to be sensible of that happiness yourself, at one time
of the day."

The lieutenant, in reply, drew back the curtain and discovered Mr.
Cymon Tuggs behind it: pallid with apprehension, and blue with wanting
to cough.

NEW YORK CITY,
       May, 1906.

“You’re so well put together that I shouldn’t have thought it. But
the household troops, though considered fine men, are built so
straggling. Walks by night, does she? When it’s moonlight, though?”

“Are you satisfied with that, or shall I finish it a little more?” said
Edith, showing the sketch to Mr Dombey.

‘That’s true!  Clemency was the first,’ said Alfred.  ‘So I defy you with
Clemency.’

“In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,
“I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;
but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,
and then they might escape.”

"Certainly, squire," said Tom Durfy; "we'll be there at four.--Till
then, good morning, squire;" and he and his man walked off; Tom having
left the widow under the care of the apothecary's boy, who was applying
asafoetida and other sweet-smelling things to the alleviation of the
faintings which the widow thought it proper and delicate to enact on the
occasion.

“Thank you, Snagsby, no further use,” says Mr. Tulkinghorn. “I am
quite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already.”

“I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay.

"'Will you come with me?' says he, putting his arm round her jokingly.

Sam nodded assent.

“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious last
night, when you swore it was Death.”

‘Yes, thank you, sir,’ replied Oliver.

‘That’s right,’ rejoined Nancy.

_Spir._ O, mortal, what a treasure didst thou cast away. She, whom you
resigned for paltry gold, became the happy wife of your former
schoolmate, Kemper. One shadow more. Behold now the tender mother of
smiling children, in their joyous home--a home that might have been your
own.

‘You are desperate,’ said the gentleman, taking out his snuff-box, ‘and
I am sorry for you.’

‘Holloa!’ said the man roughly.  ‘What’s the matter here?’

“You have achieved so much, Lady Dedlock,” said my guardian, “that
you pay some little penalty, I dare say. But none to me.”

We are looking forward to the twentieth of next month with great
pleasure. All Tavistock House send love and kisses to all Sherborne
House. If there is anything I can bring down for you, let me know in
good course of time.

[Illustration: A Disappointed Man]

"That person was your companion," said the Doctor, pointing to the
still unmoved stranger.

DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _February 27th, 1851._

“Florence! my life!” said Edith, hurriedly, “listen to me. I cannot
bear to see this grief. Be calmer. You see that I am composed, and is
it nothing to me?”

While she was thus at work, the merry little man looked at her with an
interest which did not appear to be any less when he glanced at her
helpless companion. When she had finished her work he thanked her, and
asked to what place they were traveling.

‘I an’t married, Mister,’ said Clemency.

“Ah! mercy indeed, ma’am,” was the reply. “I only hope this’ll teach
master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born
to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! he was
all but killed, ma’am, when I came in.”

His formal array of words might have at any other time, as it has
often had, something ludicrous in it, but at this time it is serious
and affecting. His noble earnestness, his fidelity, his gallant
shielding of her, his generous conquest of his own wrong and his own
pride for her sake, are simply honourable, manly, and true. Nothing
less worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the
commonest mechanic, nothing less worthy can be seen in the best-born
gentleman. In such a light both aspire alike, both rise alike, both
children of the dust shine equally.

Of Sally Brass, conflicting rumours went abroad.  Some said with
confidence that she had gone down to the docks in male attire, and had
become a female sailor; others darkly whispered that she had enlisted
as a private in the second regiment of Foot Guards, and had been seen
in uniform, and on duty, to wit, leaning on her musket and looking out
of a sentry-box in St James’s Park, one evening.  There were many such
whispers as these in circulation; but the truth appears to be that,
after the lapse of some five years (during which there is no direct
evidence of her having been seen at all), two wretched people were more
than once observed to crawl at dusk from the inmost recesses of St
Giles’s, and to take their way along the streets, with shuffling steps
and cowering shivering forms, looking into the roads and kennels as
they went in search of refuse food or disregarded offal.  These forms
were never beheld but in those nights of cold and gloom, when the
terrible spectres, who lie at all other times in the obscene
hiding-places of London, in archways, dark vaults and cellars, venture
to creep into the streets; the embodied spirits of Disease, and Vice,
and Famine.  It was whispered by those who should have known, that
these were Sampson and his sister Sally; and to this day, it is said,
they sometimes pass, on bad nights, in the same loathsome guise, close
at the elbow of the shrinking passenger.

As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more
and more, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington,
Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and
yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their
journey. At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and
Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off.
And here, the cart stopped.

‘It seems natural enough that he should.’

"They are, they are," ejaculated Mr. Tupman; "but not all men. There
lives at least one being who can never change--one being who would be
content to devote his whole existence to your happiness--who lives but
in your eyes--who breathes but in your smiles--who bears the heavy
burden of life itself only for you."

‘Why,’ said Tom ‘this is capital. It gives us a new, and quite an
uncommon interest in the dinner. We put into a lottery for a beefsteak
pudding, and it is impossible to say what we may get. We may make some
wonderful discovery, perhaps, and produce such a dish as never was known
before.’

This will reach you at Knebworth, I hope, to-morrow afternoon. Pray give
your doubts to the winds of that high spot, and believe that if I had
them I would swarm up the flag-staff quite as nimbly as Margrave and
nail the Fenwick colours to the top.

‘But the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld
her, was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity. She
fell sick. She dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son
once more, but her strength failed her, and she sank powerless on the
ground.

‘He does, of course, you observe,’ said Ralph, in the same dry, hard
manner. ‘If any caprice of temper should induce him to cast aside this
golden opportunity before he has brought it to perfection, I consider
myself absolved from extending any assistance to his mother and sister.
Look at him, and think of the use he may be to you in half-a-dozen ways!
Now, the question is, whether, for some time to come at all events, he
won’t serve your purpose better than twenty of the kind of people
you would get under ordinary circumstances. Isn’t that a question for

“—By the by,” cried Mr. Grewgious; “excuse my interrupting you; do
stop. The fog may clear in an hour or two. We can have dinner in from
just across Holborn. You had better take your Cayenne pepper here than
outside; pray stop and dine.”

Sweetly, she can assure the dear gentlemen, sweetly.  Charmingly,
charmingly.  And overjoyed to see us!

At any rate, I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I
would leave myself not a moment’s leisure to be low-spirited. For I
naturally said, “Esther! You to be low-spirited. YOU!” And it really
was time to say so, for I—yes, I really did see myself in the glass,
almost crying. “As if you had anything to make you unhappy, instead
of everything to make you happy, you ungrateful heart!” said I.

_Little Dorrit._

"Strange," thought I to myself, "that this people are not satisfied
with their lot!" Passing by a splendid shop, resplendent with cutlery,
part of my instructions came into my head, and I said to the rough
man, "In the name of the Prophet, do you still make penknives and
broad-cloth?"

Here the spinster aunt uttered a loud shriek, and became senseless.

But cautious he should be,--though bright be the day,--
    For he knows, best of any, the works of decay;
    And he ne'er should forget, in this splendid--this top age,
    That when he _won't_ draw, he inclines then to _stoppage_.
                                     Then let, &c.

"Pickwick--Pickwick," said Mr. Tupman: "come up here. Make haste."

“Trust in me now, if you please, miss,” said Charley quietly. “I am
listening to everything you say.”

‘Thank you, both,’ he said, as we rose to go.  ‘I have one last favour to
ask—not of you, doctor, for I leave you to exercise your professional
discretion—but of Mr. Holliday.’  His eyes, while he spoke, still rested
steadily on me, and never once turned towards Arthur.  ‘I beg that Mr.
Holliday will not mention to any one—least of all to his father—the
events that have occurred, and the words that have passed, in this room.
I entreat him to bury me in his memory, as, but for him, I might have
been buried in my grave.  I cannot give my reasons for making this
strange request.  I can only implore him to grant it.’

Mr. Bob Sawyer embellished one side of the fire, in his first-floor
front, early on the evening for which he had invited Mr. Pickwick, and
Mr. Ben Allen the other. The preparations for the reception of visitors
appeared to be completed. The umbrellas in the passage had been heaped
into the little corner outside the back-parlour door; the bonnet and
shawl of the landlady’s servant had been removed from the bannisters;
there were not more than two pairs of pattens on the street-door mat;
and a kitchen candle, with a very long snuff, burned cheerfully on the
ledge of the staircase window. Mr. Bob Sawyer had himself purchased the
spirits at a wine vaults in High Street, and had returned home preceding
the bearer thereof, to preclude the possibility of their delivery at the
wrong house. The punch was ready-made in a red pan in the bedroom; a
little table, covered with a green baize cloth, had been borrowed from
the parlour, to play at cards on; and the glasses of the establishment,
together with those which had been borrowed for the occasion from the
public-house, were all drawn up in a tray, which was deposited on the
landing outside the door.

Driving to the George and Vulture, they found that Arabella and her maid
had sent for a hackney-coach immediately on the receipt of a short note
from Emily announcing her arrival in town, and had proceeded straight to
the Adelphi. As Wardle had business to transact in the city, they sent
the carriage and the fat boy to his hotel, with the information that he
and Mr. Pickwick would return together to dinner at five o’clock.

“Will you take charge of the letter?” said Mr. Lorry. “You know where to
deliver it?”

“Permit me,” said the Doctor, “one moment. Allow me to present Mrs
Blimber and my daughter; who will be associated with the domestic life
of our young Pilgrim to Parnassus Mrs Blimber,” for the lady, who had
perhaps been in waiting, opportunely entered, followed by her daughter,
that fair Sexton in spectacles, “Mr Dombey. My daughter Cornelia, Mr
Dombey. Mr Dombey, my love,” pursued the Doctor, turning to his wife,
“is so confiding as to—do you see our little friend?”

XL       A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER

It chanced, while he was lounging about in this moody state, that he
stumbled upon a flight of stairs, dark, steep, and narrow, which he
ascended without any thought about the matter, and so came into a little
music-gallery, empty and deserted.  From this elevated post, which
commanded the whole hall, he amused himself in looking down upon the
attendants who were clearing away the fragments of the feast very lazily,
and drinking out of all the bottles and glasses with most commendable
perseverance.

Down sits Mr Brass’s gentleman.  Kit’s gentleman, not knowing how the
matter really stands, is afraid to pursue the subject.  Richard
Swiveller retires abashed.  Judge, jury and spectators have visions of
his lounging about, with an ill-looking, large-whiskered, dissolute
young fellow of six feet high.  The reality is, little Jacob, with the
calves of his legs exposed to the open air, and himself tied up in a
shawl.  Nobody knows the truth; everybody believes a falsehood; and all
because of the ingenuity of Mr Brass’s gentleman.

The bedsteads stood, one each side of the door; and on the inner side
    of each, was a little path, terminating in a rush-bottomed chair,
    just wide enough to admit of a person's getting into, or out of bed,
    on that side if he or she thought proper.  Having carefully drawn the
    curtains of his bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat down on the
    rush-bottomed chair, and leisurely divested himself of his shoes and
    gaiters.  He then took off and folded up, his coat, waistcoat, and
    neck-cloth, and slowly drawing on his tasseled night-cap, secured it
    firmly on his head, by tying beneath his chin, the strings which he
    always had attached to that article of dress.  It was at this moment
    that the absurdity of his recent bewilderment struck upon his mind;
    and throwing himself back in the rush-bottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick
    laughed to himself so heartily, that it would have been quite
    delightful to any man of well-constituted mind to have watched the
    smiles which expanded his amiable features, as they shone forth, from
    beneath the night-cap.

Obenreizer offered a suggestion.

"I have no doubt, Twenty Eight," returned the questioner, "that the
gentleman you refer to feels very strongly--as we all must--what you
have so properly said. We will not detain you."

‘I didn’t like to trouble you with that, because I supposed your
interest would cease with your own concern in the affair,’ said Arthur
Gride. ‘That’s kind of you to ask. Oh dear, how very kind of you! Why,
supposing I had a knowledge of some property--some little property--very
little--to which this pretty chick was entitled; which nobody does or
can know of at this time, but which her husband could sweep into his
pouch, if he knew as much as I do, would that account for--’

‘Oh dear no!’ cried Tom, who had forgotten the blotted scrap of paper
in his hand, until this inquiry brought it to his recollection. ‘“A
respectable young man, aged thirty-five”--The beginning of a description
of myself. That’s all.’

‘I WILL speak,’ cried Newman, standing on tiptoe to look over
Tim’s head, who had interposed to prevent him. ‘Hallo, you sir--old
Nickleby!--what do you mean when you talk of “a fellow like this”? Who
made me “a fellow like this”? If I would sell my soul for drink, why
wasn’t I a thief, swindler, housebreaker, area sneak, robber of pence
out of the trays of blind men’s dogs, rather than your drudge and
packhorse? If my every word was a lie, why wasn’t I a pet and favourite
of yours? Lie! When did I ever cringe and fawn to you. Tell me that!
I served you faithfully. I did more work, because I was poor, and took
more hard words from you because I despised you and them, than any
man you could have got from the parish workhouse. I did. I served you
because I was proud; because I was a lonely man with you, and there were
no other drudges to see my degradation; and because nobody knew, better
than you, that I was a ruined man: that I hadn’t always been what I
am: and that I might have been better off, if I hadn’t been a fool and
fallen into the hands of you and others who were knaves. Do you deny
that?’

‘It’s nothing,’ said Pancks.

‘No one says you can,’ said Peggotty.

“Mrs. Bolter’s humble servant,” said Fagin, bowing with grotesque
politeness. “I hope I shall know her better very shortly.”

‘Especially as it was to be expected,’ said Mr Sparkler.

‘This is a wery impartial country for justice, ‘said Sam.’ There ain’t a
magistrate goin’ as don’t commit himself twice as he commits other
people.’

The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in Fairy
shape before him.

“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have
been a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert. “Mind! I don’t
know that.”

"'No, there is not,' rejoined the guard, coolly.

Tip idled in Clifford's Inn for six months, and at the end of that term
sauntered back one evening with his hands in his pockets, and remarked
to his sister that he was not going back again.

Lizzie shot ahead, and the other boat fell astern. Lizzie’s father,
composing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the
high moralities and taken an unassailable position, slowly lighted a
pipe, and smoked, and took a survey of what he had in tow. What he had
in tow, lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat
was checked, and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away, though
for the most part it followed submissively. A neophyte might have
fancied that the ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint
changes of expression on a sightless face; but Gaffer was no neophyte
and had no fancies.

‘Ah! Exactly,’ said the old man. ‘You tell him so now. You hadn’t told
him so before, and you tell him so now. Ay, ay! That’s right! You know I
stood between you and his father so long, that it seems as if death had
made no difference, and I was still standing between you. So I will, and
so in fairness I require to have that plainly put forward. Arthur, you
please to hear that you have no right to mistrust your father, and have
no ground to go upon.’

"I am extremely sorry, my dear Emma," said Mr. Micawber, relenting, "to
have been betrayed into any expressions that might, even remotely, have
the appearance of being strong expressions. All I would say, is, that I
can go abroad without your family coming forward to favor me,--in short,
with a parting Shove of their cold shoulders; and that, upon the whole,
I would rather leave England with such impetus as I possess, than derive
any acceleration of it from that quarter. At the same time, my dear, if
they should condescend to reply to your communications--which our joint
experience renders most improbable--far be it from me to be a barrier to
your wishes."

It was with fear and trembling that I began to turn the handle; but he
sat like a lamb.  I will be my belief to my dying day, that I see his Ed
expand as he sat; you may therefore judge how great his thoughts was.  He
sat out all the changes, and then he come off.

‘Thank you, Master Copperfield,’ returned Uriah, putting his book
away upon the shelf--‘I suppose you stop here, some time, Master
Copperfield?’

‘Don’t talk stuff about dying, Liz.’

Newman stopped; not at all disconcerted.

It is a fact beyond all possibility of question, that Mr. Macready, on
assuming the management of Covent Garden Theatre in 1837, did instantly
set himself, regardless of precedent and custom down to that hour
obtaining, rigidly to suppress this shameful thing, and did rigidly
suppress and crush it during his whole management of that theatre, and
during his whole subsequent management of Drury Lane.  That he did so, as
certainly without favour as without fear; that he did so, against his own
immediate interests; that he did so, against vexations and oppositions
which might have cooled the ardour of a less earnest man, or a less
devoted artist; can be better known to no one than the writer of the
present words, whose name stands at the head of these pages.

This person wore a wig of short, coarse, red hair, which he took off
with his hat, and hung upon a nail. Having adopted in its place a dirty
cotton nightcap, and groped about in the dark till he found a remnant of
candle, he knocked at the partition which divided the two garrets, and
inquired, in a loud voice, whether Mr. Noggs had a light.

“Whew!” says Mr. George. “You are hot here. Always a fire, eh? Well!
Perhaps you do right to get used to one.” Mr. George makes the latter
remark to himself as he nods to Grandfather Smallweed.

‘No, I thank you. Not at present.’

‘I am,’ repeated the Dodger. ‘So’s Charley. So’s Fagin. So’s Sikes.
So’s Nancy. So’s Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he’s the
downiest one of the lot!’

With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an
upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This
done, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all
movables save a broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without
covering, which stood behind the door. Upon this piece of furniture,
the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew,
drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was
not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside,
threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall.

‘Are you there, Loo?’ said her brother, looking in at the door.  He was
quite a young gentleman of pleasure now, and not quite a prepossessing
one.

“‘_You_ a miserable man!’ said the king of the goblins, in a more
contemptuous tone than before. And again the king of the goblins gave
his leg a flourish; again it descended on the shoulders of the sexton;
and again the attendant goblins imitated the example of their chief.

'It is a name--a name, my child,--
    It lived in other days,
  When men were rude, their passions wild,
    Their sport, thick battle-frays.
  When, in armour bright, the warrior bold
    Knelt to his lady's eyes:
  Beneath the abbey pavement old
    That warrior's dust now lies.

ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY. By ANDREW MURRAY, F.L.S. APTERA. With numerous
        Illustrations. Large crown 8vo, 7s. 6d.

For some nights previous to the 23rd of May beacon fires were seen on
the Wicklow mountains, whose luminous appearance by night and whose
smoke by day served as signals to the disaffected in the metropolis and
in all the adjacent country. The same practice took place on all the
mountains which extend from the Scalp in the county of Wicklow to Mount
Leinster in the county of Wexford.

When we were changing horses the next time, he came from the
stable-yard, with the wet snow encrusted upon him and dropping off
him—plashing and crashing through it to his wet knees as he had been
doing frequently since we left Saint Albans—and spoke to me at the
carriage side.

‘Why, pretty well, John,’ he returned, with the distraught air of a man
who was casting about for the Philosopher’s stone, at least.  ‘Pretty
much so.  There’s rather a run on Noah’s Arks at present.  I could have
wished to improve upon the Family, but I don’t see how it’s to be done at
the price.  It would be a satisfaction to one’s mind, to make it clearer
which was Shems and Hams, and which was Wives.  Flies an’t on that scale
neither, as compared with elephants you know!  Ah! well!  Have you got
anything in the parcel line for me, John?’

“But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good
Republican? Eh?”

‘Too often, even in this sad sense!’ thought the old man.

She put it back.

“Ye-es,” repeated Miss Flite in her most genteel accents, “my
executor, administrator, and assign. (Our Chancery phrases, my love.)
I have reflected that if I should wear out, he will be able to watch
that judgment. Being so very regular in his attendance.”

I knew her. I had recognized her with amazement, for Miss Dartle.

“Yes, he did,” returned his sister. “Miss Tox and myself were present.
Miss Tox and myself are always present. We make a point of it. Mr
Pilkins has seen him for some days past, and a very clever man I
believe him to be. He says it is nothing to speak of; which I can
confirm, if that is any consolation; but he recommended, today,
sea-air. Very wisely, Paul, I feel convinced.”

He stares at his daughter, stares all around him, closes his eyes, and
lies slumbering on her arm.

‘A boy phenomenon, perhaps?’ suggested Nicholas.

“There’s somebody to speak to there, at all events,” he thought. “A
good hiding-place, too. They’ll never expect to nab me there after this
country scent. Why can’t I lay by for a week or so, and forcing blunt
from Fagin get abroad to France! Dam’me, I’ll risk it.”

‘To whom shall it be addressed, Mr Boffin?’

When he said ‘Alive!’ a great shout arose and many eyes had tears in
them.

‘I believe it does,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

"When, Peggotty?"

Mr. Pickwick was perfectly aware that a tree is a very dangerous
neighbour in a thunderstorm. He had a tree on his right, a tree on his
left, a third before him, and a fourth behind. If he remained where he
was, he might fall the victim of an accident; if he showed himself in
the centre of the garden, he might be consigned to a constable. Once or
twice he tried to scale the wall, but having no other legs this time,
than those with which Nature had furnished him, the only effect of his
struggles was to inflict a variety of very unpleasant gratings on his
knees and shins, and to throw him into a state of the most profuse
perspiration.

"It isn't that," said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and
speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.
"It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy
or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a
pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and
looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is
impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness
he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune."

Main Line: The Boy at Mugby.

Almost mad, I spurred my horse, rode at full gallop to the general’s
house, threw myself without ceremony into his room, and asked him to
give me a battalion of soldiers and fifty Cossacks to drive the rebels
out of Bélogorsk. The old soldier began to argue the matter coolly.
This exasperated me, and I told him that the daughter of our late
valiant commander was in the hands of Chvabrine, and that he was about
to force her to marry him. The general thought that she might be very
happy with him for a time, and that afterwards, when he had shot him on
the ramparts of Orenberg, it would be time enough for me to marry the
charming widow. There was no hope of softening the old man. I wandered
away in despair. Out of this despair, grew a desperate resolution.

“Listen, boy!” he said. “You shall take me where you please, so that you
take me where the people are very miserable or very wicked. I want to do
them good, and not to harm them. You shall have money, as I have told
you, and I will bring you back. Get up! Come quickly!” He made a hasty
step towards the door, afraid of her returning.

This is the first very fine day we have had. I have taken advantage of
it by crossing to Birkenhead and getting some air upon the water. It was
fresh and beautiful.

"Oh, certainly," replied Grimaldi, very much interested to know by what
mode his friend proposed to win the wager,--"certainly."

There was another deep silence; and James Cheshire said, “Then it is
decided.”

“Why don’t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,
Pip?”

"Then, Agnes, you wrong him very much. He my bad Angel, or anyone's! He,
anything but a guide, a support, and a friend to me! My dear Agnes! Now,
is it not unjust, and unlike you, to judge him from what you saw of me
the other night?"

A certain bright smile which I never saw on any other face, died away,
even while I thought how good it was, and how familiar it had once been
to me; and she asked me, with a quick change of expression (we were
drawing very near my street), if I knew how the reverse in my aunt's
circumstances had been brought about. On my replying no, she had not
told me yet, Agnes became thoughtful, and I fancied I felt her arm
tremble in mine.

The court-yard received them at last, and there he said goodbye to
Little Dorrit. Little as she had always looked, she looked less than
ever when he saw her going into the Marshalsea lodge passage, the little
mother attended by her big child.

“My friend the law-stationer’s good lady, over there,” says Mr.
Bucket, luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger. “What may YOUR
game be, ma’am?”

But even here, two men who watched the light had made
a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed
out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their
horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they
wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and
one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and
scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship
might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in
itself.

‘Yes.’

The wine was passed, and a fresh supply ordered. The visitor talked,
the Pickwickians listened. Mr. Tupman felt every moment more disposed
for the ball. Mr. Pickwick's countenance glowed with an expression of
universal philanthropy, and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass fell fast
asleep.

Startled by the implication that his face revealed too much of his mind,
Bradley made an effort to clear his brow. It might be worth knowing what
this strange man’s business was with Lightwood, or Wrayburn, or both, at
such an unseasonable hour. He set himself to find out, for the man might
prove to be a messenger between those two.

All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so
much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the
grate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said
she was almost a young woman—which seemed but yesterday—she had scarcely
attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman.

‘This night, my husband being away, he has been with me, declaring
himself my lover.  This minute he expects me, for I could release myself
of his presence by no other means.  I do not know that I am sorry, I do
not know that I am ashamed, I do not know that I am degraded in my own
esteem.  All that I know is, your philosophy and your teaching will not
save me.  Now, father, you have brought me to this.  Save me by some
other means!’

III.--THE GENTLEMAN BEGGAR                    107

‘Then how,’ said the old man, looking fearfully round, ‘how can you
bear to think that we are safe, when they are searching for me
everywhere, and may come here, and steal upon us, even while we’re
talking?’

"It is strange," he said at last; "instincts which we do not
understand form the motive-power of most of our life's actions, and
yet we refuse to admit them as evidence of any external truth.  I
suppose it is because we MUST act somehow, rightly or wrongly; and
there are a great many things which we need not believe unless we
choose.  As for this old lady, she lived long--long enough, like
most of us, to do evil; unlike most of us, long enough to witness
some of the results of that evil.  To say that, is to say that the
last years of her life must have been weighted heavily enough with
tragic thought."

They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square
in Clerkenwell, when the Dodger made a sudden stop, and, laying his
finger on his lip, drew his companions back again with the greatest
caution.

“It was all done for the—for the best, sir,” answered Giles. “I am sure
I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn’t have meddled with him. I am not
of an inhuman disposition, sir.”

CHAPTER 1 --- INTRODUCTORY, CONCERNING THE PEDIGREE OF THE CHUZZLEWIT FAMILY

It wakes again to Policinelli and pickpockets, buffo singers and beggars,
rags, puppets, flowers, brightness, dirt, and universal degradation;
airing its Harlequin suit in the sunshine, next day and every day;
singing, starving, dancing, gaming, on the sea-shore; and leaving all
labour to the burning mountain, which is ever at its work.

'For what other reason, sir,' pursued Mr. Pickwick, 'are these
    subpoenas served upon them, if not for this?'

‘No, don’t,’ returned Mrs Gowan. ‘Why should you! It is an ascertained
fact. It never does. I will therefore, if you please, go my way, leaving
you to yours. I shall at all times be happy to receive my poor fellow’s
pretty wife, and I shall always make a point of being on the most
affectionate terms with her. But as to these terms, semi-family and
semi-stranger, semi-goring and semi-boring, they form a state of things
quite amusing in its impracticability. I assure you it never does.’

After these words the bridal bonnet disappeared; with as much state as
the dimity bedgown left in it.

"Service, sir," exclaimed Sam. "You may say that. Arter I run away from
the carrier, and afore I took up with the vagginer, I had unfurnished
lodgings for a fortnight."

‘Arrange it in any way you please, sir,’ said my aunt.

‘No, no,’ rejoined Noggs; ‘they’ll be here directly. It’s all right.’

"You have got a name, you know," said I.

"I had an apprentice--the son of a dear friend, who died by my side
at Rossbach, when Soubise, with whose army I happened to be,
suffered a dreadful defeat for neglecting my advice.  The Young
Chevalier Goby de Mouchy was glad enough to serve as my clerk, and
help in some chemical experiments in which I was engaged with my
friend Dr. Mesmer.  Bathilde saw this young man.  Since women were,
has it not been their business to smile and deceive, to fondle and
lure?  Away!  From the very first it has been so!"  And as my
companion spoke, he looked as wicked as the serpent that coiled
round the tree, and hissed a poisoned counsel to the first woman.

Andy grew up in mischief and the admiration of his mammy; but, to do him
justice, he never meant harm in the course of his life, and was most
anxious to offer his services on all occasions to any one who would
accept them; but they were only those who had not already proved Andy's
peculiar powers.

[Sidenote: Mr. Thomas Mitton.]

“The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken
to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to
me? Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and
exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”

"Hah!" said Tackleton with a significant shake of his head.

* * * * *

“When people come to see the premises,” says Trottle, trying to feel his
way a little farther into the mystery of the House, “you don’t bring many
of them up here, do you?”

‘You missed a friend, you know; or you missed a foe, you know; or you
wouldn’t have come here, you know. Well, then; ain’t it reasonable to
ask, who was it?’ Thus, Mr Inspector.

This closed the proceedings of the evening. We were weary with sorrow
and fatigue, and my aunt and I were to return to London on the morrow.
It was arranged that the Micawbers should follow us, after effecting a
sale of their goods to a broker; that Mr. Wickfield's affairs should be
brought to a settlement, with all convenient speed, under the direction
of Traddles; and that Agnes should also come to London, pending those
arrangements. We passed the night at the old house, which, freed from
the presence of the Heeps, seemed purged of a disease; and I lay in my
old room, like a shipwrecked wanderer come home.

I really had some fear of Mr. Micawber’s dying on the spot. The manner
in which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences, and,
whenever he found himself getting near the name of Heep, fought his way
on to it, dashed at it in a fainting state, and brought it out with a
vehemence little less than marvellous, was frightful; but now, when
he sank into a chair, steaming, and looked at us, with every possible
colour in his face that had no business there, and an endless procession
of lumps following one another in hot haste up his throat, whence they
seemed to shoot into his forehead, he had the appearance of being in
the last extremity. I would have gone to his assistance, but he waved me
off, and wouldn’t hear a word.

At every hearth she pauses,
Touches each well-known chair;
Gazes from every window,
Lingers on every stair.
What have these months brought Bertha
Now one more year is past?
This Christmas Eve shall tell us,
The third one and the last.

‘No, no!’ said the other, clasping him by the hand. ‘Should I--should
I--tell me that again. Say I should be sure to find you.’

“Pray, cousin John,” said Ada, who had just joined us and now looked
over my shoulder, “what made him such a child?”

There is some reason to suppose that it was rather terrible to its
friends; being a statue of the Elevated or Goblin School, in which the
Honourable Elijah Pogram was represented as in a very high wind, with
his hair all standing on end, and his nostrils blown wide open. But Mr
Pogram thanked his friend and countryman for the aspiration to which he
had given utterance, and the Committee, after another solemn shaking of
hands, retired to bed, except the Doctor; who immediately repaired to
the newspaper-office, and there wrote a short poem suggested by the
events of the evening, beginning with fourteen stars, and headed, ‘A
Fragment. Suggested by witnessing the Honourable Elijah Pogram engaged

daughters. By Doctor Ginery Dunkle. Of Troy.’

"Why, so do I, then," said the Carrier. "So do I, Dot."

“Why, George,” exclaimed Mrs. Bagnet, who had been unpacking her
basket, in which there was a piece of cold pickled pork, a little tea
and sugar, and a brown loaf, “you ought to know it don’t. You ought
to know it’s enough to drive a person wild to hear you. You won’t be
got off this way, and you won’t be got off that way—what do you mean
by such picking and choosing? It’s stuff and nonsense, George.”

‘What change is there in YOU, Martin,’ she replied; ‘for that concerns
me nearest? You look more anxious and more thoughtful than you used.’

‘It wasn’t anything particular, dear,’ said the lady evasively.

Affectionately yours.

“I’ll dispose of him so, then, Mr Gills,” he answered, rising, and
shaking the old man by the hand, “until I make up my mind what to do
with him, and what he deserves. As I consider myself responsible for
him, Mr Gills,” here he smiled a wide smile at Rob, who shook before
it: “I shall be glad if you’ll look sharply after him, and report his
behaviour to me. I’ll ask a question or two of his parents as I ride
home this afternoon—respectable people—to confirm some particulars in
his own account of himself; and that done, Mr Gills, I’ll send him
round to you to-morrow morning. Goodbye!”

Three weeks had passed since the murder at Mr. Weishaupt's--three
weeks the most agitated that had been known in this sequestered
city.  We felt ourselves solitary, and thrown upon our own
resources; all combination with other towns being unavailing from
their great distance.  Our situation was no ordinary one.  Had
there been some mysterious robbers among us, the chances of a
visit, divided among so many, would have been too small to distress
the most timid; while to young and high-spirited people, with
courage to spare for ordinary trials, such a state of expectation
would have sent pulses of pleasurable anxiety among the nerves.
But murderers! exterminating murderers!--clothed in mystery and
utter darkness--these were objects too terrific for any family to
contemplate with fortitude.  Had these very murderers added to
their functions those of robbery, they would have become less
terrific; nine out of every ten would have found themselves
discharged, as it were, from the roll of those who were liable to a
visit; while such as knew themselves liable would have had warning
of their danger in the fact of being rich; and would, from the very
riches which constituted that danger, have derived the means of
repelling it.  But, as things were, no man could guess what it was
that must make him obnoxious to the murderers.  Imagination
exhausted itself in vain guesses at the causes which could by
possibility have made the poor Weishaupts objects of such hatred to
any man.  True, they were bigoted in a degree which indicated
feebleness of intellect; but THAT wounded no man in particular,
while to many it recommended them.  True, their charity was narrow
and exclusive, but to those of their own religious body it expanded
munificently; and, being rich beyond their wants, or any means of
employing wealth which their gloomy asceticism allowed, they had
the power of doing a great deal of good among the indigent papists
of the suburbs.  As to the old gentleman and his wife, their
infirmities confined them to the house.  Nobody remembered to have
seen them abroad for years.  How, therefore, or when could they
have made an enemy?  And, with respect to the maiden sisters of Mr.
Weishaupt, they were simply weak-minded persons, now and then too
censorious, but not placed in a situation to incur serious anger
from any quarter, and too little heard of in society to occupy much
of anybody's attention.

‘Dear father!’ She tried to take down the shaking arm that he flourished
in the air, but he resisted, and put her hand away.

“He’s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn’t!” said
Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval.

‘Oliver,’ said Mr. Brownlow; ‘Oliver what? Oliver White, eh?’

"No, indeed, Papa."

THE UNCOMMERCIAL
                                TRAVELLER

Susan Nipper, who had bitten both her bonnet strings at once, and
imparted a great deal of private emotion to the skylight, during this
transaction, now changed the subject by inquiring who took milk and who
took sugar; and being enlightened on these points, poured out the tea.
They all four gathered socially about the little table, and took tea
under that young lady’s active superintendence; and the presence of
Florence in the back parlour, brightened the Tartar frigate on the
wall.

"Cobbs," said the boy, "I'll tell you a secret. At Norah's house they
have been joking her about me, and pretending to laugh at our being
engaged--pretending to make game of it, Cobbs!"

As we had occasion, in a former paper, to describe a dinner at Mrs.
Tibbs’s; and as one meal went off very like another on all ordinary
occasions; we will not fatigue our readers by entering into any other
detailed account of the domestic economy of the establishment. We will
therefore proceed to events, merely premising that the mysterious
tenant of the back drawing-room was a lazy, selfish hypochondriac;
always complaining and never ill. As his character in many respects
closely assimilated to that of Mrs. Bloss, a very warm friendship soon
sprung up between them. He was tall, thin, and pale; he always fancied
he had a severe pain somewhere or other, and his face invariably wore a
pinched, screwed-up expression; he looked, indeed, like a man who had
got his feet in a tub of exceedingly hot water, against his will.

We thanked the young lady, and said we didn't wish to be troublesome;
but, she said it could be no trouble to an English soldier's daughter, to
show English soldiers how their countrymen and country-women fared, so
far away from England; and consequently we saluted again, and went in.
Then, as we stood in the shade, she showed us (being as affable as
beautiful), how the different families lived in their separate houses,
and how there was a general house for stores, and a general reading-room,
and a general room for music and dancing, and a room for Church; and how
there were other houses on the rising ground called the Signal Hill,
where they lived in the hotter weather.

Many and many a pleasant stroll they had in Covent Garden Market;
snuffing up the perfume of the fruits and flowers, wondering at the
magnificence of the pineapples and melons; catching glimpses down side
avenues, of rows and rows of old women, seated on inverted baskets,
shelling peas; looking unutterable things at the fat bundles of
asparagus with which the dainty shops were fortified as with a
breastwork; and, at the herbalist’s doors, gratefully inhaling scents
as of veal-stuffing yet uncooked, dreamily mixed up with capsicums,
brown-paper, seeds, even with hints of lusty snails and fine young curly
leeches. Many and many a pleasant stroll they had among the poultry
markets, where ducks and fowls, with necks unnaturally long, lay
stretched out in pairs, ready for cooking; where there were speckled
eggs in mossy baskets, white country sausages beyond impeachment by
surviving cat or dog, or horse or donkey; new cheeses to any wild
extent, live birds in coops and cages, looking much too big to be
natural, in consequence of those receptacles being much too little;
rabbits, alive and dead, innumerable. Many a pleasant stroll they
had among the cool, refreshing, silvery fish-stalls, with a kind of
moonlight effect about their stock-in-trade, excepting always for
the ruddy lobsters. Many a pleasant stroll among the waggon-loads of
fragrant hay, beneath which dogs and tired waggoners lay fast asleep,
oblivious of the pieman and the public-house. But never half so good a
stroll as down among the steamboats on a bright morning.

The waiter explained that he was the Verger, and that Mrs. Tope had
indeed once upon a time let lodgings herself or offered to let them;
but that as nobody had ever taken them, Mrs. Tope’s window-bill, long a
Cloisterham Institution, had disappeared; probably had tumbled down one
day, and never been put up again.

Meanwhile, Mr Swiveller, on the top of the stool, drew himself into as
flat a shape as possible against the wall, and looked, not
unconcernedly, down upon the single gentleman, who appeared at the door
growling and cursing in a very awful manner, and, with the boots in his
hand, seemed to have an intention of hurling them down stairs on
speculation.  This idea, however, he abandoned.  He was turning into
his room again, still growling vengefully, when his eyes met those of
the watchful Richard.

‘You had as good be kinder to me, Sweetlips,’ said Hugh. ‘You had,
indeed. Come. Tell me now. Why are you always so proud? I don’t quarrel
with you for it. I love you when you’re proud. Ha ha ha! You can’t hide
your beauty from a poor fellow; that’s a comfort!’

"Martha," he replied "got married, Mas'r Davy, in the second year. A
young man, a farm-laborer, as come by us on his way to market with his
mas'r's drays--a journey of over five hundred mile, theer and back--made
offers fur to take her fur his wife (wives is very scarce theer), and
then to set up fur their two selves in the Bush. She spoke to me fur to
tell him her trew story. I did. They was married, and they live fower
hundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds."

“Hush!” said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as
she looked cautiously round. “You can’t help yourself. I have tried
hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If
ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.”

“Not this time,” is the careless answer. “I leave for London again,
to-morrow. But I shall be here, off and on, until next Midsummer; then
I shall take my leave of Cloisterham, and England too; for many a long
day, I expect.”

The Chemist led him to the door. “This way,” he said, looking at him
still confusedly, but with repugnance and avoidance, growing out of his
coldness. “I’ll take you to her.”

Crown Point, 6.

“Nothing.”

As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been
staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver’s face; the boy’s eyes
were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition
was only for an instant--for the briefest space of time that can
possibly be conceived--it was enough to show the old man that he had
been observed.

It had been written in portions, at different times. I read what
follows:

His supreme contempt for his own limbs, as he sat smoking, was one of
the pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered.

He has conquered her. She falters, trembles, and puts her hand
confusedly to her head. Slight tokens these in any one else, but when
so practised an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn’s sees indecision for a moment
in such a subject, he thoroughly knows its value.

‘“And now,” said the king, fantastically poking the taper corner of his
sugar-loaf hat into the sexton’s eye, and thereby occasioning him the
most exquisite pain; “and now, show the man of misery and gloom, a few
of the pictures from our own great storehouse!”

"No, don't love me for another minute or two, if you please, John! What
I want most to tell you, I have kept to the last. My dear, good,
generous John, when we were talking the other night about the Cricket, I
had it on my lips to say, that at first I did not love you quite so
dearly as I do now; when I first came home here, I was half afraid that
I mightn't learn to love you every bit as well as I hoped and prayed I
might--being so very young, John! But, dear John, every day and hour I
loved you more and more. And if I could have loved you better than I do,
the noble words I heard you say this morning would have made me. But I
can't. All the affection that I had (it was a great deal, John) I gave
you, as you well deserve, long, long ago, and I have no more left to
give. Now, my dear husband, take me to your heart again! That's my home,
John; and never, never think of sending me to any other!"

"I mean to speak up, sir," replied Sam; "I am in the service of that
'ere gen'l'm'n, and a wery good service it is."

‘Decidedly,’ said Craggs.

‘Here, take ‘em away; run with ‘em into the bedroom; anywhere,’ said
Miss La Creevy. ‘Dear, dear; to think that I should be late on this
particular morning, of all others, after being ready for three weeks by
half-past eight o’clock, and not a soul coming near the place!’

And gentle Mr Toots, who wanders at a distance, looking wistfully
towards the figure that he dotes upon, and has followed there, but
cannot in his delicacy disturb at such a time, likewise hears the
requiem of little Dombey on the waters, rising and falling in the lulls
of their eternal madrigal in praise of Florence. Yes! and he faintly
understands, poor Mr Toots, that they are saying something of a time
when he was sensible of being brighter and not addle-brained; and the
tears rising in his eyes when he fears that he is dull and stupid now,
and good for little but to be laughed at, diminish his satisfaction in
their soothing reminder that he is relieved from present responsibility
to the Chicken, by the absence of that game head of poultry in the
country, training (at Toots’s cost) for his great mill with the Larkey
Boy.

‘Mr. P.!’ said his astonished lady.

Mrs General’s view was, that not having the honour of any acquaintance
with the lady and gentleman referred to, she was not in a position
to varnish the present article. She could only remark, as a general
principle observed in the varnishing trade, that much depended on the
quarter from which the lady under consideration was accredited to a
family so conspicuously niched in the social temple as the family of
Dorrit.

Upon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told the people that
he approved of their killing those Jews; and a mischievous maniac of a
friar, dressed all in white, put himself at the head of the assault,
and they assaulted the Castle for three days.

The next day, Hooper, who was to be burnt at Gloucester, was brought
out to take his last journey, and was made to wear a hood over his face
that he might not be known by the people. But, they did know him for
all that, down in his own part of the country; and, when he came near
Gloucester, they lined the road, making prayers and lamentations. His
guards took him to a lodging, where he slept soundly all night. At nine
o’clock next morning, he was brought forth leaning on a staff; for he
had taken cold in prison, and was infirm. The iron stake, and the iron
chain which was to bind him to it, were fixed up near a great elm-tree
in a pleasant open place before the cathedral, where, on peaceful
Sundays, he had been accustomed to preach and to pray, when he was
bishop of Gloucester. This tree, which had no leaves then, it being
February, was filled with people; and the priests of Gloucester College
were looking complacently on from a window, and there was a great
concourse of spectators in every spot from which a glimpse of the
dreadful sight could be beheld. When the old man kneeled down on the
small platform at the foot of the stake, and prayed aloud, the nearest
people were observed to be so attentive to his prayers that they were
ordered to stand farther back; for it did not suit the Romish Church to
have those Protestant words heard. His prayers concluded, he went up to
the stake and was stripped to his shirt, and chained ready for the
fire. One of his guards had such compassion on him that, to shorten his
agonies, he tied some packets of gunpowder about him. Then they heaped
up wood and straw and reeds, and set them all alight. But, unhappily,
the wood was green and damp, and there was a wind blowing that blew
what flame there was, away. Thus, through three-quarters of an hour,
the good old man was scorched and roasted and smoked, as the fire rose
and sank; and all that time they saw him, as he burned, moving his lips
in prayer, and beating his breast with one hand, even after the other
was burnt away and had fallen off.

‘Shabby?’ snorted Pancks. ‘Yes, I should think so! The lot that your
Casby belongs to, is the shabbiest of all the lots. Setting their
Grubbers on, at a wretched pittance, to do what they’re ashamed and
afraid to do and pretend not to do, but what they will have done, or
give a man no rest! Imposing on you to give their Grubbers nothing but
blame, and to give them nothing but credit! Why, the worst-looking
cheat in all this town who gets the value of eighteenpence under false
pretences, an’t half such a cheat as this sign-post of The Casby’s Head
here!’

CHIRP THE FIRST

‘Nobody shall go near her,’ said the man, starting fiercely up, as
the undertaker approached the recess. ‘Keep back! Damn you, keep
back, if you’ve a life to lose!’

“Hard it is!” said Captain Cuttle, and immediately drew in his head, as
if he expected a squall.

‘“Lovely creetur I feel myself a damned--“’

THE LETTERS OF CHARLES DICKENS, Vol 1 of 3

‘That’s it,’ replied Mr. Folair. ‘The distressed lady, overpowered by old
recollections, faints at the end of the dance, and you close in with a
picture.’

The meek man was afraid we must take it as proved, because there were
the Inquests and the Registrar’s returns.

The phaeton was a very handsome affair; the horses arched their necks
and lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors’
Commons. There was a good deal of competition in the Commons on all
points of display, and it turned out some very choice equipages then;
though I always have considered, and always shall consider, that in my
time the great article of competition there was starch: which I think
was worn among the proctors to as great an extent as it is in the nature
of man to bear.

“There!” said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back
into its former position. “If the sea ever gives up its dead—as books
say it will—it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash
among it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant
party.”

I stood for some minutes with that dream-like feeling upon me, gazing at
the box in the dim obscure light.  It could _not_ be real!  My fancy must
be playing a trick upon me!  But the sound of a light step—for, light as
it was, I heard it distinctly as it approached the room—broke my trance,
and I hastened to replace the box on the piano, and to stoop down as if
examining the music before the door opened.  I had not sent in my name to
Mrs. Forbes, for I did not suppose that she was acquainted with it, nor
could she see me distinctly, as I stood in the gloom.  But I could see
her.  She had the slight slender figure, the childlike face, and the fair
hair of Miss Anne Clifton.  She came quickly across the room, holding out
both her hands in a childish appealing manner.

“I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at
present,” returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, “that it would be greatly
advanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole
bar.”

‘Jeremiah? Tea-time? I don’t know what’s come to me. But I got such a
dreadful turn, Jeremiah, before I went--off a-dreaming, that I think it
must be that.’

"Then out and spak the nobil King,
       And round him cast a wilie ee.

With nothing more threatening about him, it appeared, than a leather
apron and a dirty face. ‘Let him come in.’ In he came--Mr Tappertit;
with his hair still on end, and a great lock in his hand, which he put
down on the floor in the middle of the chamber as if he were about to go
through some performances in which it was a necessary agent.

An inspiration of affection for a half-drunken carter going his way led
to Mr Riderhood’s being elevated on a high heap of baskets on a waggon,
and pursuing his journey recumbent on his back with his head on his
bundle. Bradley then turned to retrace his steps, and by-and-by struck
off through little-traversed ways, and by-and-by reached school and
home. Up came the sun to find him washed and brushed, methodically
dressed in decent black coat and waistcoat, decent formal black tie, and
pepper-and-salt pantaloons, with his decent silver watch in its pocket,
and its decent hair-guard round his neck: a scholastic huntsman clad for
the field, with his fresh pack yelping and barking around him.

Rochester Cathedral, proposed burial of Dickens in, ii. 448

‘Dear boy!’ returned Eugene with a smile, ‘we both thank you heartily.
Lizzie, tell them how welcome they are, and that I would be eloquent if
I could.’

‘I know it must have been,’ she answered. ‘When have I forgotten to
think of it and you?’

‘Waiter!’

"This know I, Master Thomas Marsh," said the stranger gravely, "that
thy life is even now perilled: evil practices are against thee; but no
matter, thou art quit for the nonce--other hands than mine have saved
thee! Thy pains are over. Hark! _the clock strikes One!_" As he spoke,
a single toll from the bell-tower of Bilsington came, wafted by the
western breeze, over the thick-set and lofty oaks which intervened
between the Frith and what had been once a priory. Dr. Aldrovando
turned as the sound came floating on the wind, and was moving, as
if half in anger, towards the other side of the stage, where the
mountebank, his fires extinct, was now disgorging to the admiring crowd
yard after yard of gaudy-coloured riband.

‘Extremely awkward,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

Interrupting himself with these words, he very politely bowed to a
middle-aged gentleman at an upper window, to whom he spoke--not because
the gentleman could hear him (for he certainly could not), but as an
appropriate accompaniment to his salutation.

‘You don’t like to hear the name of the cause?’ said the little man,
still busying himself with the knot.

Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders; and,
beckoning his friend to approach, fixed a searching look upon him, and
uttered in a low, but distinct and emphatic tone, these remarkable
words:

"Oh!--Well, I think he has got off pretty easy," said Tackleton, taking
a chair.

‘Yes, and being practical people, a result has gradually sprung up in
the minds of Mrs Meagles and myself which perhaps you may--or perhaps
you may not--understand. Pet and her baby sister were so exactly alike,
and so completely one, that in our thoughts we have never been able
to separate them since. It would be of no use to tell us that our dead
child was a mere infant. We have changed that child according to the
changes in the child spared to us and always with us. As Pet has grown,
that child has grown; as Pet has become more sensible and womanly, her
sister has become more sensible and womanly by just the same degrees.
It would be as hard to convince me that if I was to pass into the other
world to-morrow, I should not, through the mercy of God, be received
there by a daughter, just like Pet, as to persuade me that Pet herself
is not a reality at my side.’

"No, sir," replied my companion, with an emphasis that made me start;
"would you have had a son of the ancient house of L---- go and work
upon the highway? to degrade himself with trade? or----"

“My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at
the French house, in the Opera Colonnade.”

I did not mean to do it, but I ran upstairs into my room and hid
myself behind the door. There I stood trembling, even when I heard my
darling calling as she came upstairs, “Esther, my dear, my love,
where are you? Little woman, dear Dame Durden!”

"Il y a certaines façons de parler dans toutes les langues de l'Europe,
que l'on retrouve partout dans la bouche du vulgaire. A cette classe
apparsions "_Qui es tu?_" "_Comment va ta mere?_" En Italie comme
en France on n'entend que ça."--L'Abbé Bossu _sur les idiotismes du
langage_.

With these words, the fat boy led the way down-stairs; his pretty
companion captivating all the waiters and angering all the chambermaids
as she followed him to the eating-room.

I made my way to Mr. Waterbrook, and said, that I believed I had the
pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there.

“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.

We are all well and hearty, and have already begun to wonder what time
next year you and Mrs. Felton and Dr. Howe will come across the briny
sea together. To-morrow we go to the seaside for two months. I am
looking out for news of Longfellow, and shall be delighted when I know
that he is on his way to London and this house.

Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled
over the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight,
tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for
five-and-thirty feet. There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of
the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his
stiffening hand.

“Mrs Dombey becomes a secondary consideration, when we are both in
question, I imagine,” said Mr Dombey. “Is that so?”

‘That’s wot he says, miss,’ replied Sam coolly. ‘He’s a man of his word,
and it’s my opinion he’ll do it, miss. He’s heerd all about you from the
sawbones in barnacles.’

‘So she does,’ assented Mr. Lumbey. ‘A great deal more.’

“If you’re going directly, I can,” replied the man, looking out of the
pot. “Are you going to Halliford?”

“He appears to be an excellent master,” I observed.

Ting, ting, ting! went the bell again. The curtain was violently
convulsed, but rose no higher; the audience tittered; Mrs. Porter
looked at Uncle Tom; Uncle Tom looked at everybody, rubbing his hands,
and laughing with perfect rapture. After as much ringing with the
little bell as a muffin-boy would make in going down a tolerably long
street, and a vast deal of whispering, hammering, and calling for nails
and cord, the curtain at length rose, and discovered Mr. Sempronius
Gattleton _solus_, and decked for _Othello_. After three distinct
rounds of applause, during which Mr. Sempronius applied his right hand
to his left breast, and bowed in the most approved manner, the manager
advanced and said:

“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”

‘Not a whisper.’

He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me, but recovered
himself and said, “How de do, sir?”

“Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?” inquired Mr. Grimwig.

"There! If ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection,
you are, Steerforth. If I understand any noddle in the world, I
understand yours. Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling? I
understand yours," peeping down into his face. "Now you may mizzle,
Jemmy (as we say at Court), and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair
I'll operate on him."

What _was_ it?

[86]_October, 1867._

She remained so long silent after this that Nell feared she was vexed.
At length she said,--

‘I will do my endeavours, sir,’ replied Mr. Bumble. ‘How do you do,
sir? I hope you are very well.’

"By my truly, a scape o' the narrowest!" quoth the Conjuror; "the next
course, dive you not the readier, there is no more life in you than
in a pickled herring. What! courage, Master Marsh; but be heedful: an
they miss again, let them bide the issue!" He drew his hand athwart
his brow as he spoke, and dashed off the perspiration, which the
violence of his exercise had drawn from every pore. Black Tom sprang
upon the edge of the bath, and stared full in the face of the bather:
his sea-green eyes were lambent with unholy fire, but their marvellous
obliquity of vision was not to be mistaken,--the very countenance,
too!--Could it be?--the features were feline, but their expression
that of the Jack-Pudding? Was the Mountebank a Cat, or the Cat a
Mountebank?--it was all a mystery; and Heaven knows how long Marsh
might have continued staring at Grimalkin, had not his attention been
again called by Aldrovando to the magic mirror. Great dissatisfaction,
not to say dismay, seemed to pervade the conspirators; Dame Isabel was
closely inspecting the figure's wounded hand, while José was aiding the
pharmacopolist to charge a huge petronel with powder and bullets. The
load was a heavy one; but Erasmus seemed determined this time to make
sure of his object. Somewhat of trepidation might be observed in his
manner as he rammed down the balls, and his withered cheek appeared
to have acquired an increase of paleness; but amazement rather than
fear was the prevailing symptom, and his countenance betrayed no jot
of irresolution. As the clock was about to chime half-past nine, he
planted himself with a firm foot in front of the image, waved his
unoccupied hand with a cautionary gesture to his companions, and, as
they hastily retired on either side, brought the muzzle of his weapon
within half a foot of his mark. As the shadowy form was about to draw
the trigger, Marsh again plunged his head beneath the surface; and
the sound of an explosion, as of fire-arms, mingled with the rush of
water that poured into his ears. His immersion was but momentary, yet
did he feel as though half suffocated: he sprang from the bath, and,
as his eye fell on the mirror, he saw, or thought he saw, the Leech
of Folkestone lying dead on the floor of his wife's boudoir, his
head shattered to pieces, and his hand still grasping the stock of a
bursten petronel. He saw no more; his head swam, his senses reeled, the
whole room was turning round, and, as he fell to the ground, the last
impressions to which he was conscious were the chucklings of a hoarse
laughter and the mewings of a Tom Cat.

‘Oh! nothing more,’ rejoined Gride.

Richmond, Duke of, 19.

“Gentlemen,” said the Reverend, presenting him, “our so long respected
friend and fellow-pilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge, is
desirous to offer a word or two.  Attention, gentlemen, one and all!”

We are bound, on the authority of Mr. Pickwick, to state that
Mr. Tupman's mode of proceeding evinced far more of prudence and
deliberation, than that adopted by Mr. Winkle. Still, this by no means
detracts from the great authority of the latter gentleman, on all
matters connected with the field; because, as Mr. Pickwick beautifully
observes, it has somehow or other happened, from time immemorial, that
many of the best and ablest philosophers, who have been perfect lights
of science in matters of theory, have been wholly unable to reduce
them to practice.

Mr. George looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the
ground, from the ground to Mr. Smallweed, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr.
Tulkinghorn, and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again,
often in his perplexity changing the leg on which he rests.

The messenger looked towards Will Marks beseechingly.

"I should also," observed the doctor, who had passed the foot-bath on
the stairs, "I should also," said the doctor, in a very wise tone of
voice, "put her feet in hot water and wrap them up in flannel. I should
likewise," said the doctor, with increased solemnity, "give her
something light for supper--the wing of a roasted chicken now------"

The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his
pains; but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of disgust,
looked anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself:
which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus
afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally
the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way
through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar. “Come, get up,”
said the man roughly.

"'Hush! I have found him at last.'

Excited, as it appeared, by a sense of injury, I thought he would never
have found an end for the last word.  But, at length it rolled sullenly
away with the thunder.

The offence was proved, as she delivered the indictment. Clennam
appeared at the carriage-door, bearing the little insensible figure in
his arms.

“We are all weak creeturs,” said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general
principle.

"Without a story--really?" inquired Dora, creeping closer to me.

But I told Traddles, and Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, that before I could
think of leaving, they must appoint a day when they would come and dine
with me. The occupations to which Traddles stood pledged, rendered it
necessary to fix a somewhat distant one; but an appointment was made for
the purpose, that suited us all, and then I took my leave.

‘You have no bill or demand upon me—my name is Bowley, Sir Joseph
Bowley—of any kind from anybody, have you?’ said Sir Joseph.  ‘If you
have, present it.  There is a cheque-book by the side of Mr. Fish.  I
allow nothing to be carried into the New Year.  Every description of
account is settled in this house at the close of the old one.  So that if
death was to—to—’

"Ah, Trot!" said my aunt, shaking her head, and smiling gravely; "blind,
blind, blind!"

‘Ah, lad!  ’Tis thou?’  When she had said this, with a smile which would
have been quite expressed, though nothing of her had been seen but her
pleasant eyes, she replaced her hood again, and they went on together.

"Art in Heaven. Is the light a-coming, sir?"

I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” and
finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which was
somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my
pence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pence
make three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had
done for me, “_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?” To which I
replied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I was
so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.

‘Have you no money at all, papa?’

I pondered on those words, even while I was studiously attending to
what followed, as if they had some particular interest, or some strange
application that I could not divine. ‘There can be no disparity in
marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose’--‘no disparity in
marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose.’

‘I may grow rich!’ repeated Nicholas, with a mournful smile, ‘ay, and
I may grow old! But rich or poor, or old or young, we shall ever be the
same to each other, and in that our comfort lies. What if we have but
one home? It can never be a solitary one to you and me. What if we were
to remain so true to these first impressions as to form no others? It is
but one more link to the strong chain that binds us together. It seems
but yesterday that we were playfellows, Kate, and it will seem but
tomorrow when we are staid old people, looking back to these cares as we
look back, now, to those of our childish days: and recollecting with a
melancholy pleasure that the time was, when they could move us. Perhaps
then, when we are quaint old folks and talk of the times when our step
was lighter and our hair not grey, we may be even thankful for the
trials that so endeared us to each other, and turned our lives into that
current, down which we shall have glided so peacefully and calmly. And
having caught some inkling of our story, the young people about us--as
young as you and I are now, Kate--may come to us for sympathy, and pour
distresses which hope and inexperience could scarcely feel enough for,
into the compassionate ears of the old bachelor brother and his maiden
sister.’

‘How _can_ you ask such questions, sir?’ replies the functionary, in an
incredibly loud key, and pettishly grasping the thick stick he carries
in his right hand. ‘Pray do not, sir. I beg of you; pray do not, sir.’
The little man looks remarkably out of his element, and the uninitiated
part of the throng are in positive convulsions of laughter.

Captain Carton had, in the boat by him, a curious long-barrelled Spanish
gun, and he had said to Miss Maryon one day that it was the best of guns,
and had turned his head to me, and said:

Any animated description of a modern battle, any private soldier’s letter
published in the newspapers, any page of the records of the Victoria
Cross, will show that in the ranks of the army, there exists under all
disadvantages as fine a sense of duty as is to be found in any station on
earth.  Who doubts that if we all did our duty as faithfully as the
soldier does his, this world would be a better place?  There may be
greater difficulties in our way than in the soldier’s.  Not disputed.
But, let us at least do our duty towards _him_.

"I think we may," replied Mr. Snodgrass; who would have assented to
any proposition, because he knew nothing about the matter. The officer
crossed to Doctor Slammer, and Mr. Snodgrass went up to Mr. Winkle.

What with this noise on the part of Mr. Commissioner Pordage, and what
with the cries of Sergeant Drooce on the raft astern (which were
sometimes more than Tom Packer could silence), we often made our slow way
down the river, anything but quietly.  Yet, that it was of great
importance that no ears should be able to hear us from the woods on the
banks, could not be doubted.  We were looked for, to a certainty, and we
might be retaken at any moment.  It was an anxious time; it was, indeed,
indeed, an anxious time.

Thornbury, Mr. Walter, letter to, 239

"I don't think you can move him," said the gentleman, shaking his head.
"I wouldn't take the responsibility of saying it could be done, myself.
You had better leave him where he is. He can't live long."

‘I will restore to you what I have withheld from you. Forgive me. Can
you forgive me?’

“Don’t worry me now, Fagin!” replied the girl, raising her head
languidly. “If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has
done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and
when he can’t he won’t; so no more about that.”

“Git rid of ’em, Mr. Chops.”

Broke-Vere, Sir Charles, 116.

“Just so, sir,” said Mr. Vholes. “Mr. C.’s address is not a hundred
miles from here, sir, Mr. C.’s address is not a hundred miles from
here. Would you take a seat, sir?”

"'No, indeed! I do not!--which sister?'

‘You are master here, R. W.,’ returned his wife. ‘It is as you think;
not as I do. Perhaps it might have been better if the man had taken the
door too?’

‘He brought me; oh! he brought me,’ cried Smike.

I resumed my downward way, and, stepping out upon the level of the
railroad and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark sallow man,
with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows.  His post was in as solitary
and dismal a place as ever I saw.  On either side, a dripping-wet wall of
jagged stone, excluding all view but a strip of sky; the perspective one
way, only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon; the shorter
perspective in the other direction, terminating in a gloomy red light,
and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel, in whose massive
architecture there was a barbarous, depressing, and forbidding air.  So
little sunlight ever found its way to this spot, that it had an earthy
deadly smell; and so much cold wind rushed through it, that it struck
chill to me, as if I had left the natural world.

BOY. Oh, mother--outside the baker's we smell such a goose! It must have
been ours--no one has got such a goose. Oh, gemini! (_They dance round
the table in childish glee._)

"It's none in the least in life, sir," said she.

‘Both,’ replied Sam; ‘easy shavin’ was his natur’, and cuttin’ and
curlin’ was his pride and glory.  His whole delight wos in his trade.  He
spent all his money in bears, and run in debt for ’em besides, and there
they wos a growling avay down in the front cellar all day long, and
ineffectooally gnashing their teeth, vile the grease o’ their relations
and friends wos being re-tailed in gallipots in the shop above, and the
first-floor winder wos ornamented vith their heads; not to speak o’ the
dreadful aggrawation it must have been to ’em to see a man alvays a
walkin’ up and down the pavement outside, vith the portrait of a bear in
his last agonies, and underneath in large letters, “Another fine animal
wos slaughtered yesterday at Jinkinson’s!”  Hows’ever, there they wos,
and there Jinkinson wos, till he wos took wery ill with some inn’ard
disorder, lost the use of his legs, and wos confined to his bed, vere he
laid a wery long time, but sich wos his pride in his profession, even
then, that wenever he wos worse than usual the doctor used to go
down-stairs and say, “Jinkinson’s wery low this mornin’; we must give the
bears a stir;” and as sure as ever they stirred ’em up a bit and made ’em
roar, Jinkinson opens his eyes if he wos ever so bad, calls out, “There’s
the bears!” and rewives agin.’

“Well, sir,” returns Mr. Snagsby, “you see, my little woman is—not
to put too fine a point upon it—inquisitive. She’s inquisitive. Poor
little thing, she’s liable to spasms, and it’s good for her to have
her mind employed. In consequence of which she employs it—I should
say upon every individual thing she can lay hold of, whether it
concerns her or not—especially not. My little woman has a very
active mind, sir.”

At Tschedal, just below Ismail, we come to anchor; and, after a short
delay, a trim little boat shoots smartly out from the Bessarabian
shore towards us. It is pulled by six rowers, in the peculiar grey
great-coats and black leather cross-belts which distinguish Russian
soldiers. At the helm is a seventh soldier decorated with a brass badge
and some medal of merit; at the prow stands an eighth; in the seat
of honour sits the officer empowered to examine our passports, and to
ascertain that our ship carries no military stores or contraband of
war. At the bottom of the boat is a pile of muskets, and from the stern
flutters the Russian war flag--a blue cross on a white ground.

“Did they come ashore here?”

"Don't tell me a lie," retorted the schoolmaster. "He is."

“You can leave the room, Sir!” said Mr Dombey, haughtily.

"I understand you," Scrooge returned, "and I would do it, if I could.
But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power."

Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold
his tongue! A moral revolution!

He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in
spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, "You think
not."

I accepted the gift thankfully, and bought a loaf with it. Dispatching
this refreshment by the way, I went in the direction my friend had
indicated, and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses he
had mentioned. At length I saw some before me; and approaching them,
went into a little shop (it was what we used to call a general shop, at
home), and inquired if they could have the goodness to tell me where
Miss Trotwood lived. I addressed myself to a man behind the counter, who
was weighing some rice for a young woman; but the latter, taking the
inquiry to herself, turned round quickly.

[91] "Eripiunt subito nubes coelumque diemque."--Virg. Æn. i. v. 88.

“Come to me?”

“Quite right, and quite true.”

Nor had he spoken idly when he said the old man should be gagged. He had
resolved to ensure his silence; and he looked to the end, not the means.
He had been rough and rude and cruel to the old man all his life; and
violence was natural to his mind in connection with him. ‘He shall be
gagged if he speaks, and pinioned if he writes,’ said Jonas, looking at
him; for they sat alone together. ‘He is mad enough for that; I’ll go
through with it!’

Some more company coming in, among whom were the two masters and Adams,
the talk became general; and it naturally turned on Mr. Jack Maldon, and
his voyage, and the country he was going to, and his various plans and
prospects. He was to leave that night, after supper, in a postchaise,
for Gravesend; where the ship, in which he was to make the voyage, lay;
and was to be gone--unless he came home on leave, or for his health--I
don't know how many years. I recollect it was settled by general consent
that India was quite a misrepresented country, and had nothing
objectionable in it, but a tiger or two, and a little heat in the warm
part of the day. For my own part, I looked on Mr. Jack Maldon as a
modern Sinbad, and pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in
the east, sitting under canopies, smoking curly golden pipes--a mile
long, if they could be straightened out.

The Yorkshireman remained on his post for a few minutes, but, finding
that there was no pause in the conversation inside, crept back again
unheard, and stood, listening over the stair-rail, for a full hour.
Everything remaining perfectly quiet, he got into Mr. Squeers’s bed, once
more, and drawing the clothes over his head, laughed till he was nearly
smothered.

The King had been taken for security to a place called Hurst Castle: a
lonely house on a rock in the sea, connected with the coast of
Hampshire by a rough road two miles long at low water. Thence, he was
ordered to be removed to Windsor; thence, after being but rudely used
there, and having none but soldiers to wait upon him at table, he was
brought up to St. James’s Palace in London, and told that his trial was
appointed for next day.

“It blows, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar,
“enough to cut one’s ears off.”

“Trouble, my Lady. Sad trouble. Oh, my Lady, may I beg a word with
you?”

Gride, who had been peering narrowly about the room, fell, at that
moment, upon his knees before a large chest, and uttered a terrible
yell.

She blest the hour when first he came
To take the crown of pride and fame,
Wreathed through long ages for his name.

‘Then go before, and down, you Affery,’ said Jeremiah. ‘And do it
properly, or I’ll come rolling down the banisters, and tumbling over
you!’

‘Ye--yes,’ said John, ‘oh, yes.’

Continuing their perambulation, they reached the present site of
Waterloo-bridge.

Our landlady was the widow of a silver-worker, and lived by the sale of
filigree ornaments, cheap jewellery, combs, fans, and toys in ivory and
jet.  She had an only daughter named Gianetta, who served in the shop,
and was simply the most beautiful woman I ever beheld.  Looking back
across this weary chasm of years, and bringing her image before me (as I
can and do) with all the vividness of life, I am unable, even now, to
detect a flaw in her beauty.  I do not attempt to describe her.  I do not
believe there is a poet living who could find the words to do it; but I
once saw a picture that was somewhat like her (not half so lovely, but
still like her), and, for aught I know, that picture is still hanging
where I last looked at it—upon the walls of the Louvre.  It represented a
woman with brown eyes and golden hair, looking over her shoulder into a
circular mirror held by a bearded man in the background.  In this man, as
I then understood, the artist had painted his own portrait; in her, the
portrait of the woman he loved.  No picture that I ever saw was half so
beautiful, and yet it was not worthy to be named in the same breath with
Gianetta Coneglia.

“Mr. Bumble,” cried that discreet lady in a whisper, for the fright
was so great that she had quite lost her voice, “Mr. Bumble, I shall
scream!” Mr. Bumble made no reply, but in a slow and dignified manner
put his arm round the matron’s waist.

“Is he coming here to see her?”

‘You should have kept your secret better.’

Accordingly, I told Agnes about my declaration of poverty, about the
cookery-book, the housekeeping accounts, and all the rest of it.

Some short time after this evening, Mr. T. Dibdin left Sadler's Wells.
He was succeeded in the capacity of stage-manager by Mr. Campbell, who
retained the situation with credit to himself and satisfaction to the
proprietors for several years: remaining in it, in fact, until the
establishment was again let.

Oliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making
an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier
tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering
her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the
tears which she was now unable to repress.

“_I_ know why,” said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much
mud had washed into his throat.

Jacob complied, and accompanied Randulph to the corner of Hedge Lane,
a narrow thoroughfare running into Cockspur Street, where he took his
leave. Randulph and his uncle then tracked the lane above mentioned,
until they came to Whitcomb Street, where Kitty Conway then resided,
having removed from the Hay-market to an old house in the latter street,
erected three years after the Great Fire of London--namely, 1669.

At first sight, this would have appeared merely a wise precaution in
a man of sedentary habits, with the view of opening the chest and
strengthening the muscles of the arms. But the intense eagerness and
joy depicted in the face of Newman Noggs, which was suffused with
perspiration; the surprising energy with which he directed a constant
succession of blows towards a particular panel about five feet eight
from the ground, and still worked away in the most untiring and
persevering manner, would have sufficiently explained to the attentive
observer, that his imagination was thrashing, to within an inch of his
life, his body’s most active employer, Mr. Ralph Nickleby.

Fortune, who, as the poet says, delights to favour the bold, stood his
friend on this occasion. Edward had been, for some time, collecting a
large force on the coast of Kent, to carry on his French wars for the
recovery of Guienne; he was expected shortly to review it in person;
but, then, the troops lay principally in cantonments about the mouth of
the Thames, and his majesty was to come down by water. What was to be
done?--the royal barge was in sight, and John de Northwood and Hamo de
Crevecoeur had broken up all the boats to boil their camp-kettles. A
truly great mind is never without resources.

[Sidenote: Mr. Peter Cunningham.]

Fate's hand pluck'd the bud ere it blossom'd to fame,
      No withering canker its leaflets had known;
    The ministering angels her fellowship claim,
      And rejoice o'er a spirit as pure as their own!

“To be sure,” said Mr Toots, “that’s exactly what I said. I knew you
didn’t. There is a dog, Captain Gills, connected with—but excuse me.
That’s forbidden ground.”

‘Out of temper! What the devil do you mean by that piece of
impertinence, Mr. Kenwigs?’ said the collector. ‘Morleena, child--give me
my hat.’

"Among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and
fortune," said I, looking over my letters, "and who discover that they
were always much attached to me, is the self-same Creakle. He is not a
schoolmaster now, Traddles. He is retired. He is a Middlesex
Magistrate."

[Illustration: "DEUCE TAKE THE MAN!" SAID MY AUNT STERNLY, "WHAT'S HE
ABOUT! DON'T BE GALVANIC, SIR!"--Chap. xxxv.]

Away we go again, by muddy roads, and through the most shattered and
tattered of villages, where there is not a whole window among all the
houses, or a whole garment among all the peasants, or the least
appearance of anything to eat, in any of the wretched hucksters’ shops.
The women wear a bright red bodice laced before and behind, a white
skirt, and the Neapolitan head-dress of square folds of linen,
primitively meant to carry loads on.  The men and children wear anything
they can get.  The soldiers are as dirty and rapacious as the dogs.  The
inns are such hobgoblin places, that they are infinitely more attractive
and amusing than the best hotels in Paris.  Here is one near Valmontone
(that is Valmontone the round, walled town on the mount opposite), which
is approached by a quagmire almost knee-deep.  There is a wild colonnade
below, and a dark yard full of empty stables and lofts, and a great long
kitchen with a great long bench and a great long form, where a party of
travellers, with two priests among them, are crowding round the fire
while their supper is cooking.  Above stairs, is a rough brick gallery to
sit in, with very little windows with very small patches of knotty glass
in them, and all the doors that open from it (a dozen or two) off their
hinges, and a bare board on tressels for a table, at which thirty people
might dine easily, and a fireplace large enough in itself for a
breakfast-parlour, where, as the faggots blaze and crackle, they
illuminate the ugliest and grimmest of faces, drawn in charcoal on the
whitewashed chimney-sides by previous travellers.  There is a flaring
country lamp on the table; and, hovering about it, scratching her thick
black hair continually, a yellow dwarf of a woman, who stands on tiptoe
to arrange the hatchet knives, and takes a flying leap to look into the
water-jug.  The beds in the adjoining rooms are of the liveliest kind.
There is not a solitary scrap of looking-glass in the house, and the
washing apparatus is identical with the cooking utensils.  But the yellow
dwarf sets on the table a good flask of excellent wine, holding a quart
at least; and produces, among half-a-dozen other dishes, two-thirds of a
roasted kid, smoking hot.  She is as good-humoured, too, as dirty, which
is saying a great deal.  So here’s long life to her, in the flask of
wine, and prosperity to the establishment.

This draft on Mr Boffin’s philosophy could only be met by that gentleman
with the remark that everything that is at all, must begin at some time.
Then, tucking his wife’s arm under his own, that she might not be left
by herself to be troubled again, he descended to release Wegg. Who,
being something drowsy after his plentiful repast, and constitutionally
of a shirking temperament, was well enough pleased to stump away,
without doing what he had come to do, and was paid for doing.

‘No, no,’ rejoined Brass quickly, ‘I don’t suppose anything.  Don’t say
I said you did.  You’ll come back quietly, I hope?’

‘You know better,’ cried the old man, advancing his weazen face at least
a yard, and starting forward in his chair to do it. ‘You lie! What, you
WILL be a hypocrite, will you?’

‘Mr Jefferson Brick, sir,’ said the colonel, filling Martin’s glass
and his own, and pushing the bottle to that gentleman, ‘will give us a
sentiment.’

"Miss Wardle," said Mr. Tupman, "you are an angel." Miss Rachel blushed
very becomingly. Much more conversation of this nature followed until
finally Mr. Tupman proceeded to do what his enthusiastic emotions
prompted and what were, (for all we know, for we are but little
acquainted with such matters) what people in such circumstances always
do. She started, and he, throwing his arms around her neck imprinted
upon her lips numerous kisses, which, after a proper show of struggling
and resistance, she received so passively that there is no telling how
many more Mr. Tupman might have bestowed if the lady had not given a
very unaffected start and exclaimed: "Mr. Tupman, we are observed! We
are discovered!"

‘You’re out of spirits,’ said Quilp, drawing up a chair.  ‘What’s the
matter?’

CHAPTER 37

The contest between you and your oppressors cannot be long.

Mr Doyce stood, chamber-candlestick in hand, the other hand in his
pocket, looking hard at the flame of his candle, with a certain quiet
perception in his face that they were going to say something more.

“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t do. If
you were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you
would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!
Besides, it’s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker’s
house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you
know.”

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _24th February, 1855._

Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of
all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter
of course--and in truth it was something very like it in that house.
Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan)
hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigor;
Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot
plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the
two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting
themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into
their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came
to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It
was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly
all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but
when she did, and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth,
one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,
excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle
of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!

"I can't.  We're in Society together, and what would Society say?"

All little children are poets if not marred by the prosaic parent or
teacher who unintentionally dulls the imaginative faculties by
insisting upon their minds dwelling exclusively on _facts_ which can
be verified by the five senses.

"It's Cobbs!  It's Cobbs!" cries Master Harry, and comes running to him,
and catching hold of his hand.  Miss Norah comes running to him on
t'other side and catching hold of his t'other hand, and they both jump
for joy.

"A poor fellow with a craze, sir," said Mr. Dick, "a simpleton, a
weak-minded person--present company, you know!" striking himself again,
"may do what wonderful people may not do. I'll bring them together,
boy. I'll try. They'll not blame _me_. They'll not object to _me_.
They'll not mind what _I_ do, if it's wrong. I'm only Mr. Dick. And
who minds Dick? Dick's nobody! Whoo!" He blew a slight, contemptuous
breath, as if he blew himself away.

“Ay. Where are those two?”

‘All of a shiver,’ said Mr. Dick, counterfeiting that affection and
making his teeth chatter. ‘Held by the palings. Cried. But, Trotwood,
come here,’ getting me close to him, that he might whisper very softly;
‘why did she give him money, boy, in the moonlight?’

"A little leisure and a little gold, and your raw colonist, too,
will have the tastes of a pasha."

Mr. Winkle ran hastily upstairs, and with a trembling hand opened the
bag. There was the coat in its usual place, but exhibiting, on a close
inspection, evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night.

Most persons would have said, I think, that Pete's method of departure
was hardly appropriate for one who had been selected by the citizens of
Carter's Camp to go on an important mission. But Pete had his own
reasons for his actions. He crept along behind the stumps and logs till
he reached the forest. Then, as if the shadow gave him fresh courage and
dignity, he drew himself upright, and started at a sharp trot down the
road toward the village.

In this office, nevertheless, Snitchey and Craggs made honey for their
several hives. Here sometimes they would linger, of a fine evening, at
the window of their council-chamber, overlooking the old battle-ground,
and wonder (but that was generally at assize time, when much business
had made them sentimental) at the folly of mankind, who couldn't always
be at peace with one another, and go to law comfortably. Here days, and
weeks, and months, and years, passed over them; their calendar, the
gradually diminishing number of brass nails in the leathern chairs, and
the increasing bulk of papers on the tables. Here nearly three years'
flight had thinned the one and swelled the other, since the breakfast in
the orchard; when they sat together in consultation, at night.

‘Quite disgusted with her, papa,’ said Fanny. ‘I really don’t see what
she has to do with my marriage. Let her keep to her own matrimonial
projects--if she has any.’

Gashford deserted him, of course. He subsisted for a time upon his
traffic in his master’s secrets; and, this trade failing when the stock
was quite exhausted, procured an appointment in the honourable corps
of spies and eavesdroppers employed by the government. As one of these
wretched underlings, he did his drudgery, sometimes abroad, sometimes at
home, and long endured the various miseries of such a station. Ten or a
dozen years ago--not more--a meagre, wan old man, diseased and miserably
poor, was found dead in his bed at an obscure inn in the Borough, where
he was quite unknown. He had taken poison. There was no clue to his
name; but it was discovered from certain entries in a pocket-book he
carried, that he had been secretary to Lord George Gordon in the time of
the famous riots.

But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he
preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very
easily disengage himself from the chair, the sign of the Cripples was,
for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively’s presence. By the
time he had got upon his legs the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively,
after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight
of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a
shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and
mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.

The people murmured at all this, and were still very sore about the
French marriage. The nobles saw how little the King cared for law, and
how crafty he was, and began to be somewhat afraid for themselves. The
King’s life was a life of continued feasting and excess; his retinue,
down to the meanest servants, were dressed in the most costly manner,
and caroused at his tables, it is related, to the number of ten
thousand persons every day. He himself, surrounded by a body of ten
thousand archers, and enriched by a duty on wool which the Commons had
granted him for life, saw no danger of ever being otherwise than
powerful and absolute, and was as fierce and haughty as a King could
be.

After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in
coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at
last it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that
Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I
was sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher
pretensions.

“You know the hand,” he said, “and if you are firm enough to read it
to me, do! But be particular to a word.”

Descending from the sublime when she had reached this point, to the
details of common life, Mrs Jarley remarked that with reference to
salary she could pledge herself to no specific sum until she had
sufficiently tested Nell’s abilities, and narrowly watched her in the
performance of her duties.  But board and lodging, both for her and her
grandfather, she bound herself to provide, and she furthermore passed
her word that the board should always be good in quality, and in
quantity plentiful.

Saying which, he went on his toes to the door, which I had left open,
and carefully closed it. He then came back, and took up his former
position. There was an obtrusive show of compassionate zeal in his voice
and manner, more intolerable--at least to me--than any demeanour he
could have assumed.

Mr. Crisparkle, with a significant nod complied; and rejoining Neville,
went away with him. They dined together, and parted at the yet
unfinished and undeveloped railway station: Mr. Crisparkle to get home;
Neville to walk the streets, cross the bridges, make a wide round of
the city in the friendly darkness, and tire himself out.

The door opened, and the father paused there.

He furthermore conjured him to avoid, above all things, the vice of
intoxication, which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine, and to
those poisonous and baleful drugs which, being chewed in the mouth,
are said to filch away the memory. At this point of his discourse, the
reverend and red-nosed gentleman became singularly incoherent, and
staggering to and fro in the excitement of his eloquence, was fain to
catch at the back of a chair to preserve his perpendicular.

"Edward! Was it you?"

CHAPTER XVIII
CONCLUDING REMARKS

"You think I am joking.  But let me ask you why you consider the
tiger more bloodthirsty than yourself?  He springs upon his food--
you buy yours from the butcher.  He cannot live without animal
food: it is a primal necessity, and he obeys the ordained instinct.
You can live on vegetables; yet you slaughter beasts of the field
and birds of the air (or buy them when slaughtered), and consider
yourself a model of virtue.  The tiger only kills his food or his
enemies; you not only kill both, but you kill one animal to make
gravy for another!  The tiger is less bloodthirsty than the
Christian!"

Of Walter she thought often. Ah! how often, when the night was gloomy,
and the wind was blowing round the house! But hope was strong in her
breast. It is so difficult for the young and ardent, even with such
experience as hers, to imagine youth and ardour quenched like a weak
flame, and the bright day of life merging into night, at noon, that
hope was strong yet. Her tears fell frequently for Walter’s sufferings;
but rarely for his supposed death, and never long.

_Consisting of the following Dishes_:

"And now to descend to the subject I was before speaking of, which was
of the violent Tempest, and terrible Earth-quake, &c. that hapned at
Hereford, be pleased to observe the true Relation thereof, which is
thus:

So as the Captain and his wife sat sadly over their fire, the door
opened, and Pax ran in shaking his bells, and followed by the nursery
mummers. The performance was most successful. It was by no means
pathetic, and yet, as has been said, the Captain's wife shed tears.

But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little
circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once
more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint
upon some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail
to remark. Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for
a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears
upon her face. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure
to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that
something was in progress which affected the peace of the young
lady, and of somebody else besides.

Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man
looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.

THE WRECK OF THE GOLDEN MARY (1856),                     131

It was a lovely spot to which they repaired, and Oliver, whose days
had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and
brawling, seemed to enter upon a new existence there. The rose and
honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls, the ivy crept round the trunks
of the trees, and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious
odours. Hard by, was a little churchyard: not crowded with tall,
unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh
turf and moss, beneath which the old people of the village lay at rest.
Oliver often wandered here, and thinking of the wretched grave in which
his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, as he
raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of
her as lying in the ground, and weep for her sadly, but without pain.

Such, according to this most authentic old story, was all that was to
be found of Tom's wife. She had probably attempted to deal with the
black man as she had been accustomed to deal with her husband; but
though a female scold is generally considered a match for the devil,
yet in this instance she appears to have had the worst of it. She must
have died game, however; for it is said Tom noticed many prints of
cloven feet deeply stamped about the tree, and found handfuls of hair,
that looked as if they had been plucked from the coarse black shock of
the woodsman. Tom knew his wife's prowess by experience. He shrugged
his shoulders as he looked at the signs of fierce clapper-clawing.
"Egad," said he to himself, "Old Scratch must have had a tough time of
it!"

‘Nor Vilson?’

“Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to
take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were
close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!
We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or
dead, that’s all I know about him.”

“The message had been given to her,” she said. “How, she did not know.”

"Do you care for taters?" said the waiter, with an insinuating smile,
and his head on one side. "Young gentlemen generally has been overdosed
with taters."

"Come, come!" continued the captain, "Speak out.  What is it, boy!"

Mingling with that delusion of the teapot which inspired her with
the belief that they wanted her to go somewhere immediately, a shrewd
avoidance of any further reference to the topics into which she had
lately strayed, Mrs Gamp rose; and putting away the teapot in its
accustomed place, and locking the cupboard with much gravity proceeded
to attire herself for a professional visit.

"Why so?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

MY DEAR JERROLD,

“Well, he is just the size I want,” said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.

‘Very,’ said Mr. Winkle, not much relishing this close connection of the
two names.

There was nothing very interesting in the scenery of this day’s journey,
which brought us at midnight to Louisville.  We slept at the Galt House;
a splendid hotel; and were as handsomely lodged as though we had been in
Paris, rather than hundreds of miles beyond the Alleghanies.

‘He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,’ said
Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.

"Me handsome, Davy!" said Peggotty. "Lawk, no, my dear! But what put
marriage in your head?"

‘I should like,’ he said, ‘to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig.
He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of
material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer,
and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and
a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is
recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.’

‘And what do you mean by your look?’ I retorted, quietly.

‘To give her pain?’ said Bella, repeating the phrase quickly, with her
eyebrows raised.

“My dear friend!” the old man gives him both his hands.

Judy, not interested in what she has often heard, begins to collect
in a basin various tributary streams of tea, from the bottoms of cups
and saucers and from the bottom of the tea-pot for the little
charwoman’s evening meal. In like manner she gets together, in the
iron bread-basket, as many outside fragments and worn-down heels of
loaves as the rigid economy of the house has left in existence.

Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,—which at
first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining
quiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our
chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had
met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was
gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the
inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His
uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an
hour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who
volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.
Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his
uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he
resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the
Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,
finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham’s, where they lost me.
Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when
I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh
themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.
Among the loungers under the Boar’s archway happened to be Trabb’s
Boy,—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he
had no business,—and Trabb’s boy had seen me passing from Miss
Havisham’s in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb’s boy became
their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by
the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went
along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought
there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’s
safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be
mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and
went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,
endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could
hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was
while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I
was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,
and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.

‘Why, you’re as bold as brass!’ said Jonas, in the utmost admiration.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pickwick and his friends having walked their blood into
active circulation, proceeded cheerfully on; the paths were hard, the
grass was crisp and frosty, the air had a fine, dry, bracing coldness,
and the rapid approach of the grey twilight (slate-coloured is a better
term in frosty weather) made them look forward with pleasant
anticipation to the comforts which awaited them at their hospitable
entertainer’s. It was the sort of afternoon that might induce a couple
of elderly gentlemen, in a lonely field, to take off their great coats
and play at leap-frog in pure lightness of heart and gaiety; and we
firmly believe that had Mr. Tupman at that moment proffered “a back,”
Mr. Pickwick would have accepted his offer with the utmost avidity.

‘I should think so,’ observed Miss Fanny, with a toss of her head and
a glance at her sister. ‘But they would not have been recalled to our
remembrance, I suspect, if Uncle hadn’t tumbled over the subject.’

‘Dear me,’ said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily
rising with great politeness, ‘I beg your pardon, young lady--I
imagined it was some importunate person who--I beg you will excuse
me. Be seated, pray.’

[Illustration: "O DON'T CRY!" SAID LITTLE DORRIT PITEOUSLY. "DON'T,
DON'T! GOOD-BYE, JOHN. GOD BLESS YOU!" "GOOD-BYE, MISS AMY. GOOD-BYE!"
AND SO HE LEFT HER--Book 1, chap, xviii.]

‘You are a very old friend of my nephew’s, Mr. Micawber,’ said my aunt.
‘I wish I had had the pleasure of seeing you before.’

XIV
CHAMBERS

The Secretary had no reason or excuse for prolonging the conversation,
and it ended here. Within three hours the oakum-headed apparition once
more dived into the Leaving Shop, and that night Rogue Riderhood’s
recantation lay in the post office, addressed under cover to Lizzie
Hexam at her right address.

The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was
quiet. The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them.
Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was
soon asleep again.

The Deputy Lock opened the letter with a grave face, which underwent no
change as he eyed its contents. But it might have done, if he could have
read them.

CHAPTER 40

‘Really,’ said Miss Squeers; ‘so embarrassing that I scarcely know what
I--very sorry to give you so much trouble.’

Mr Haredale surveyed him with a look of cold contempt. ‘You may evade an
explanation, I know,’ he said, folding his arms. ‘But I must have it. I
can wait.’

“Mama,” sobbed Florence, “we are not to part?”

“My dear Richard,” I returned, “you know you would be heartily
welcome at his house—your home, if you will but consider it so; and
you are as heartily welcome here!”

"Master Davy," said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking hand,
and speaking in a breathless sort of way. "What do you think? You have
got a Pa!"

Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and
resumed:

This was rather too violent exercise to last long.  When they were all
three wearied out and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged
Oliver, struggling and shouting but nothing daunted, into the
dust-cellar, and there locked him up.  This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry
sank into a chair and burst into tears.

Out of this same airy talk of his, it always soon came to be understood,
wherever he and his wife went, that he had married against the wishes
of his exalted relations, and had had much ado to prevail on them to
countenance her. He never made the representation, on the contrary
seemed to laugh the idea to scorn; but it did happen that, with all his
pains to depreciate himself, he was always in the superior position.
From the days of their honeymoon, Minnie Gowan felt sensible of being
usually regarded as the wife of a man who had made a descent in marrying
her, but whose chivalrous love for her had cancelled that inequality.

“No doubt you have heard the story?” said Cousin Feenix.

The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us,
the light-hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence, the
fantastic way in which he took himself under his own protection and
argued about that curious person, combined with the delightful ease
of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian’s case. The
more I saw of him, the more unlikely it seemed to me, when he was
present, that he could design, conceal, or influence anything; and
yet the less likely that appeared when he was not present, and the
less agreeable it was to think of his having anything to do with any
one for whom I cared.

Mr Pecksniff had, in short, but one comfort, and that was the knowledge
that all these his relations and friends had hated him to the very
utmost extent before; and that he, for his part, had not distributed
among them any more love than, with his ample capital in that respect,
he could comfortably afford to part with. This view of his affairs
yielded him great consolation; and the fact deserves to be noted, as
showing with what ease a good man may be consoled under circumstances of
failure and disappointment.

‘Brother Gimblet’ (said the shopman, who was one of the brotherhood) ‘is
with him.’

‘I don’t know anything about it,’ replied the bewildered Tottle.

"Was it dark just now?" he asked presently.

I might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke, if I
had given it a thought; but I gave it none until afterwards. I hurried
away to the parlour; and there I found Mr. Creakle, sitting at his
breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him, and Mrs. Creakle
with an opened letter in her hand. But no hamper.

I had made up my mind to speak to him now. In short, I had come down
on purpose. “Guardian,” I said, rather hesitating and trembling,
“when would you like to have the answer to the letter Charley came
for?”

W. Harrison Ainsworth.

At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth
swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and
considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a
shovelful of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew
round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a
one, and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass: two
tumblers and a custard-cup without a handle.

The sun rose high, and sank, and the battle still raged. Through all
the wild October day, the clash and din resounded in the air. In the
red sunset, and in the white moonlight, heaps upon heaps of dead men
lay strewn, a dreadful spectacle, all over the ground.

"True, very true, sir," said David, and I was half in doubt whether the
handkerchief would be put in requisition again; but it kept its place
across the knees of my host, and Bessum continued. "From the day she
left us, sir, we saw no more of our dear child for two years; but sad
was the tale that reached us in the mean while. Think of her wrongs,
sir;--the man who had taken her, to be parted but by death, left her
the very next day, after he had robbed scores of honest hearts of the
chance of proving the sincerity of their love by a life of cherishing
and devotion."

In Christmas 1783, he once more appeared at Drury Lane, in a pantomime
called "Hurly Burly."[10] In this piece he had to represent, not
only the old part of the monkey, but that of a cat besides; and in
sustaining the latter character he met with an accident, his speedy
recovery from which would almost induce one to believe that he had
so completely identified himself with the character as to have eight
additional chances for his life. The dress he wore was so clumsily
contrived, that when it was sewn upon him he could not see before
him; consequently, as he was running about the stage, he fell down a
trap-door, which had been left open to represent a well, and tumbled
down a distance of forty feet, thereby breaking his collar-bone,
and inflicting several contusions upon his body. He was immediately
conveyed home, and placed under the care of a surgeon, but he did not
recover soon enough to appear any more that season at Drury Lane,
although at Easter he performed at Sadler's Wells as usual.

‘Don’t be alarmed, my darling. Mr Lightwood will find that he is quite
justified in taking leave of me here. At all events,’ added Rokesmith,
‘he will find that I mean to take leave of him here.’

“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding
his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the
old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
now in despondency!”

In the prisoner’s cell, waiting to be examined by the magistrate on a
charge of theft, was a boy.  This lad, instead of being committed to a
common jail, would be sent to the asylum at South Boston, and there
taught a trade; and in the course of time he would be bound apprentice to
some respectable master.  Thus, his detection in this offence, instead of
being the prelude to a life of infamy and a miserable death, would lead,
there was a reasonable hope, to his being reclaimed from vice, and
becoming a worthy member of society.

"Mr. Dodson or Mr. Fogg at home, sir?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, gently,
advancing, hat in hand, towards the partition.

Pit-pat!
                What's that?
        Something that moves soft and slow,
        Like graceful dancer in a furbelow!--
                What are you? Ho!
        A walking Vestris, with a leg to show?
                    So be it!
        Come, come, you all-engrossing Fog,
        You're "going the whole hog,"
          And hoggishly won't let me see it!
        Pit-pat again! _encore_ pit-pat!
    Oh, disappointment dire! a vagabond tom-cat!
    Here, Paddy that I kick'd, if you can see,
    Kick this great mousing brute in lieu of me!

“Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”

‘Ah! I mean to pay him too,’ retorted Eugene. ‘But then I mean so much
that I—that I don’t mean.’

‘A lady who is stopping in this house,’ answered the girl.

“There, sir!” I timidly explained. “Also Georgiana. That’s my mother.”

‘Newman, Newman,’ said Nicholas, laying his hand upon his shoulder: ‘it
was the wrong servant too.’

The fat boy nodded.

Art thou alone, and does thy soul complain
It lives in vain?
Not vainly does he live who can endure
Oh be thou sure,
That he who hopes and suffers here, can earn
A sure return.

"Respecting this same boarding and lodging, Young Master Wilding," said
he.

“I shall see you soon, Paul. You are free on Saturdays and Sundays, you
know.”

‘If I have no assurance to the contrary,’ I added, therefore, ‘I shall
take it for granted that he has done so, and that even these papers come
within our new agreement.  Everybody being mute, we hold that
understanding if you please.’

Thinking of this, she did not turn away with a delicate indignation—too
many of her own compassionate and tender sex too often do—but pitied
her.

"Next day is the first of September, and you're pledged to ride out
with us, as far as Sir Geoffrey Manning's grounds, at all events, and
to meet us at lunch, if you don't take the field."

‘Lord bless us! what an extraordinary case!’ gasped Mrs. Bloss, as if
she understood the communication in its literal sense, and was
astonished at a gentleman without a stomach finding it necessary to
board anywhere.

It is half-past five o’clock, and an autumn afternoon, when the reader
and Solomon Gills become acquainted. Solomon Gills is in the act of
seeing what time it is by the unimpeachable chronometer. The usual
daily clearance has been making in the City for an hour or more; and
the human tide is still rolling westward. “The streets have thinned,”
as Mr Gills says, “very much.” It threatens to be wet tonight. All the
weatherglasses in the shop are in low spirits, and the rain already
shines upon the cocked hat of the wooden Midshipman.

"Late it is, master, as you say.--I'll take a seat in the
chimney-corner, if you have nothing to urge against it, ma'am; for I
am a little moist on the side that was next the rain."

The poor fellow stood gazing at her, overflowing with sympathy, but not
knowing what to make of this, until, having taken out her handkerchief
and put it to her still averted face, she hurried away. At first he
remained stock still; then hurried after her.

‘What’s his name?’ inquired Mr. Weller, colouring up very red with
sudden excitement, and the friction of the towel combined.

‘Water-rate?’ said His Majesty.

Again the little dried gentleman put his hand to his forehead, and again
Mr Fledgeby seemed to enjoy his doing it. When the gentleman changed his
attitude with a sigh, Fledgeby spake with a grin.

She answered with such a start that it quite awoke me. And then she
stopped in her work and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its
thread's length.

‘My child is welcome, though unlooked for,’ said she, at the time
presenting her cheek as if it were a cool slate for visitors to enrol
themselves upon. ‘You too, R. W., are welcome, though late. Does the
male domestic of Mrs Boffin hear me there?’ This deep-toned inquiry was
cast forth into the night, for response from the menial in question.

"I don't think he'll escape us quite so easily the next time, Sam?"
said Mr. Pickwick.

“Is there anybody there?” cried Mr Dombey, calling out. “Where are the
men? where are the women? Is there no one there?”

"Now, John dear! Good night, May! Good night, Bertha!"

He might have said more; but, the Bells, the old familiar Bells, his own
dear, constant, steady friends, the Chimes, began to ring the joy-peals
for a New Year: so lustily, so merrily, so happily, so gaily, that he
leapt upon his feet, and broke the spell that bound him.

‘He came back with Mr Lightwood, I know, near upon two hours ago. But if
he has gone to bed, I’ll put a paper in his letter-box. I am expected.’

‘Well, sir, to make short of a long story, I was left in possession,
and in possession I remained; and though I was an ignorant man, and the
master of the house a clever one, I saw what he never did, but what he
would give worlds now (if he had ’em) to have seen in time. I saw, sir,
that his wife was wasting away, beneath cares of which she never
complained, and griefs she never told. I saw that she was dying before
his eyes; I knew that one exertion from him might have saved her, but
he never made it. I don’t blame him: I don’t think he _could_ rouse
himself. She had so long anticipated all his wishes, and acted for him,
that he was a lost man when left to himself. I used to think when I
caught sight of her, in the clothes she used to wear, which looked
shabby even upon her, and would have been scarcely decent on any one
else, that if I was a gentleman it would wring my very heart to see the
woman that was a smart and merry girl when I courted her, so altered
through her love for me. Bitter cold and damp weather it was, yet,
though her dress was thin, and her shoes none of the best, during the
whole three days, from morning to night, she was out of doors running
about to try and raise the money. The money _was_ raised and the
execution was paid out. The whole family crowded into the room where I
was, when the money arrived. The father was quite happy as the
inconvenience was removed—I dare say he didn’t know how; the children
looked merry and cheerful again; the eldest girl was bustling about,
making preparations for the first comfortable meal they had had since
the distress was put in; and the mother looked pleased to see them all
so. But if ever I saw death in a woman’s face, I saw it in hers that
night.

"Well played, Mr. Vendale!  You combine the foreign quickness with the
English solidity.  Accept my best congratulations.  Accept, also, my
written guarantee."

“Because,” said I, “Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have
told each other so.”

“No,” said Mr. Grewgious. “What is the Landlesses? An estate? A villa?
A farm?”

“Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?”

“Well! But this is a very remarkable document, Mr. Vholes,” said Mr.
Kenge.

“A man leading a monotonous life,” Jasper proceeds, “and getting his
nerves, or his stomach, out of order, dwells upon an idea until it
loses its proportions. That was my case with the idea in question. So I
shall burn the evidence of my case, when the book is full, and begin
the next volume with a clearer vision.”

“You have no harder meaning, I am sure,” said Laura, quietly, “because I
love my sister very much.”

‘Granted,’ replied Wardle. ‘“I am sorry to hear you express your opinion
against marriages of affection, pa,” said Bella, colouring a little. “I
was wrong; I ought not to have said so, my dear, either,” said I,
patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it,
“for your mother’s was one, and so was yours.” “It’s not that I meant,
pa,” said Bella. “The fact is, pa, I wanted to speak to you about
Emily.”’

‘No,’ the child replied.

And when Florence found how hard Paul's studies were for him, she
quietly bought books just like his and studied them during the week, so
that she might keep along with him and help him when they were together.

“At six,” says Mrs. Snagsby.

“I wish he had let it off,” says the benevolent old man, “and blown
his head into as many pieces as he owed pounds!”

‘I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can’t think,’ replied the
matron. ‘They’re _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful,
that they are quite companions for me.’

Relics of St. Pius, 463.

"Well," said the second lieutenant, "let us give the gentleman another
shot, and then come to close quarters. Mr. Mitchell, you have a pistol
in your hand: fire!"

Mr Dombey said he would, with pleasure.

The young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name
Richard Carstone. He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and
a most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to where we
sat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a
light-hearted boy. He was very young, not more than nineteen then, if
quite so much, but nearly two years older than she was. They were
both orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had
never met before that day. Our all three coming together for the
first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we
talked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its
red eyes at us—as Richard said—like a drowsy old Chancery lion.

Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused
not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having
rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs
and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the
wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who
opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him
at the best of times, started back in astonishment.

The whole Court was a great flaunting crowd of debauched men and
shameless women; and Catherine’s merry husband insulted and outraged
her in every possible way, until she consented to receive those
worthless creatures as her very good friends, and to degrade herself by
their companionship. A Mrs. Palmer, whom the King made Lady
Castlemaine, and afterwards Duchess of Cleveland, was one of the most
powerful of the bad women about the Court, and had great influence with
the King nearly all through his reign. Another merry lady named Moll
Davies, a dancer at the theatre, was afterwards her rival. So was Nell
Gwyn, first an orange girl and then an actress, who really had good in
her, and of whom one of the worst things I know is, that actually she
does seem to have been fond of the King. The first Duke of St. Albans
was this orange girl’s child. In like manner the son of a merry
waiting-lady, whom the King created Duchess Of Portsmouth, became the
Duke of Richmond. Upon the whole it is not so bad a thing to be a
commoner.

‘Charming!’ said the lovely Emily.

The king made a shyer bow.

Some of them hurried up to where he lay;--the hangman with them.
Everything had passed so quickly, that the smoke had not yet scattered,
but curled slowly off in a little cloud, which seemed like the dead
man’s spirit moving solemnly away. There were a few drops of blood upon
the grass--more, when they turned him over--that was all.

I know you will readily believe that I would come if I could, and that I
am heartily sorry I cannot.

“Were you looking for me,” he said, “when you peered in at the window?”

"Oh, what can I do to prevent these dreadful quarrels!" exclaimed
Arabella.

‘You are,’ said Giles.

He only winked lazily, when she kissed his ball of a head.

But how quiet the streets are!  Are there no itinerant bands; no wind or
stringed instruments?  No, not one.  By day, are there no Punches,
Fantoccini, Dancing-dogs, Jugglers, Conjurers, Orchestrinas, or even
Barrel-organs?  No, not one.  Yes, I remember one.  One barrel-organ and
a dancing-monkey—sportive by nature, but fast fading into a dull, lumpish
monkey, of the Utilitarian school.  Beyond that, nothing lively; no, not
so much as a white mouse in a twirling cage.

I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the
bottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow. So I said:

‘I a’most forgot the piller, I declare!’ said Mrs Gamp, drawing it away.
‘There! Now he’s comfortable as he can be, I’m sure! I must try to make
myself as much so as I can.’

But having stood before him, silent, for a little while, it moved towards
the fire; then stopped.

‘They do not,’ replied Rose, colouring deeply.

Not only that evening, but for several succeeding evenings, Clennam was
quite charmed by this investigation. The more he pursued it, and the
oftener he glanced at the grey head bending over it, and the shrewd eye
kindling with pleasure in it and love of it--instrument for probing his
heart though it had been made for twelve long years--the less he could
reconcile it to his younger energy to let it go without one effort more.
At length he said:

"And see how he leaves it cooling on the step!" said another voice.

‘Indeed, Miss Trotwood,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘all that I could say has
been so well said by my brother, and all that I know to be the fact
has been so plainly stated by him, that I have nothing to add except my
thanks for your politeness. For your very great politeness, I am sure,’
said Miss Murdstone; with an irony which no more affected my aunt, than
it discomposed the cannon I had slept by at Chatham.

But not all the way to Canada; in fact, not further than Liverpool.
After making the voyage to that port from London, he found himself
so strongly impelled to cut the vessel, that he resolved to walk back
again. Carrying out which intention, he presented himself before her at
the expiration of a month, in rags, without shoes, and much more tired
than ever.

‘Belongs to you?’ said the head of the party, stopping it.

The stranger was poorly clad and very dirty. His voice was harsh, but
though his face was half hidden with long, dark hair, it was neither
unkind nor bad.

[Sidenote: Mr. W. H. Wills.]

‘It’s in the world, bold Barnaby, the merry world; not in solitary
places like those you pass your time in, but in crowds, and where
there’s noise and rattle.’

‘And have you come all this way at last, solely to speak to me?’

It is to be remarked of chambers in general, that they must have been
built for chambers, to have the right kind of loneliness.  You may make a
great dwelling-house very lonely, by isolating suites of rooms and
calling them chambers, but you cannot make the true kind of loneliness.
In dwelling-houses, there have been family festivals; children have grown
in them, girls have bloomed into women in them, courtships and marriages
have taken place in them.  True chambers never were young, childish,
maidenly; never had dolls in them, or rocking-horses, or christenings, or
betrothals, or little coffins.  Let Gray’s Inn identify the child who
first touched hands and hearts with Robinson Crusoe, in any one of its
many ‘sets,’ and that child’s little statue, in white marble with a
golden inscription, shall be at its service, at my cost and charge, as a
drinking fountain for the spirit, to freshen its thirsty square.  Let
Lincoln’s produce from all its houses, a twentieth of the procession
derivable from any dwelling-house one-twentieth of its age, of fair young
brides who married for love and hope, not settlements, and all the
Vice-Chancellors shall thenceforward be kept in nosegays for nothing, on
application to the writer hereof.  It is not denied that on the terrace
of the Adelphi, or in any of the streets of that
subterranean-stable-haunted spot, or about Bedford-row, or James-street
of that ilk (a grewsome place), or anywhere among the neighbourhoods that
have done flowering and have run to seed, you may find Chambers replete
with the accommodations of Solitude, Closeness, and Darkness, where you
may be as low-spirited as in the genuine article, and might be as easily
murdered, with the placid reputation of having merely gone down to the
sea-side.  But, the many waters of life did run musical in those dry
channels once;—among the Inns, never.  The only popular legend known in
relation to any one of the dull family of Inns, is a dark Old Bailey
whisper concerning Clement’s, and importing how the black creature who
holds the sun-dial there, was a negro who slew his master and built the
dismal pile out of the contents of his strong box—for which architectural
offence alone he ought to have been condemned to live in it.  But, what
populace would waste fancy upon such a place, or on New Inn, Staple Inn,
Barnard’s Inn, or any of the shabby crew?

‘La, Kate, my dear,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, shrinking back, ‘how you do
tickle one! Of course, I understand THAT, my love, without your telling
me; and I said the same to Nicholas, and I AM very much pleased. You
didn’t tell me, Nicholas, my dear,’ added Mrs. Nickleby, turning round
with an air of less reserve than she had before assumed, ‘what your
friend’s name is.’

His account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable result,
that it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he might have
another hug of himself under the chin. Once apart from him, I was
determined to keep apart; and we walked back, side by side, saying very
little more by the way.

[Sidenote: Mr. J. C. Parkinson.]

‘And imposition,’ added Gowan, laughing; ‘we won’t leave out the
imposition. I hope I may not break down in that; but there, my being
a disappointed man may show itself. I may not be able to face it out
gravely enough. Between you and me, I think there is some danger of my
being just enough soured not to be able to do that.’

“Where will you put me?” he asked, presently. “I must be put
somewheres, dear boy.”

The cries of the two elder MacStingers, and the wailing of young
Alexander, who may be said to have passed a piebald childhood,
forasmuch as he was black in the face during one half of that fairy
period of existence, combined to make this visitation the more awful.
But when silence reigned again, and the Captain, in a violent
perspiration, stood meekly looking at Mrs MacStinger, its terrors were
at their height.

I was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell, pleased to have
discovered, in these happier circumstances, Mr. Mell, formerly poor
pinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate, when Mr. Peggotty pointing
to another part of the paper, my eyes rested on my own name, and I read
thus:

_Abbess._
    Get along, you naughty woman,
      You'll contaminate us all;
    When you touch'd the gate, I wonder
      That the convent did not fall!
    Stop! I think you mention'd money,--
      That is--penitence, I mean:
    Let her in,--I'm _too_ indulgent;--
      Pray how are the king and queen?

"To be sure, stranger," said the shepherd. "And faith, you've been
lucky in choosing your time, for we are having a bit of a fling for
a glad cause--though, to be sure, a man could hardly wish that glad
cause to happen more than once a year."

The chairman with great solemnity then read the following list of the
guests whom he proposed to introduce:—Mrs. Taunton and two daughters,
Mr. Wizzle, Mr. Simson. The names were respectively balloted for, and
Mrs. Taunton and her daughters were declared to be black-balled. Mr.
Percy Noakes and Mr. Hardy exchanged glances.

‘Certainly, Sir,’ replied Jinks.

“We must put it to the vote,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “who may he be?”

_Rose._                          If he leaves it, he dies.

Uriah stopped short, put his hands between his great knobs of knees, and
doubled himself up with laughter. With perfectly silent laughter. Not
a sound escaped from him. I was so repelled by his odious behaviour,
particularly by this concluding instance, that I turned away without any
ceremony; and left him doubled up in the middle of the garden, like a
scarecrow in want of support.

[Illustration: "I MAY BE FOND OF PENNYWINKLES, MRS. RICHARDS, BUT IT
DON'T FOLLOW THAT I'M TO HAVE 'EM FOR TEA"--Chap. iii.]

‘Well,’ sighed Mr. Gradgrind, ‘we will not enter into the question.  I
assure you I have no desire to be controversial.  I seek to repair what
is amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good
spirit, Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.’

"If you had seen him, miss," I told her, "as I saw him when he
volunteered, you would have known that his spirit is strong enough for
any strife.  It will bear his body, miss, to wherever duty calls him.  It
will always bear him to an honourable life, or a brave death."

Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or
couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done
in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from
public life forevermore, the floor was swept and watered, the lamps
were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as
snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to
see upon a winter's night.

This was so quickly done, and the demeanour of both gentlemen--who
were not young men either--was so gallant and resolute, that the crowd
faltered and stared at each other with irresolute and timid looks. Many
tried to turn towards the door; some of the faintest-hearted cried they
had best go back, and called to those behind to give way; and the panic
and confusion were increasing rapidly, when Gashford whispered Hugh.

All this time, Mr Boffin had been rolling his eyes over his loosened
neckerchief, as if his fit were still upon him. Appearing now to think
that he was coming to, he stared straight before him for a while, tied
his neckerchief again, took several long inspirations, swallowed several
times, and ultimately exclaimed with a deep sigh, as if he felt himself
on the whole better: ‘Well!’

“That has nothing to do with it!” returned Richard. “I have got ten
pounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to
spend it without being particular.”

‘Amen to that,’ replied Sam, ‘and a fat and happy liven’ they’d get out
of it! Wish you good-night, ladies.’

I don't know how it may be with you, but it is the fashion here to be
absolutely certain that the Emperor of the French is fastened by
Providence and the fates on a throne of adamant expressly constructed
for him since the foundations of the universe were laid.

_Chorus_ (_sarcastically_)--But Dick put a couple of balls in his
            nob,
        And perwailed on him to stop.

‘I should get up, sir, to acknowledge such an honour as this visit,’
said he, ‘only my limbs are rather out of sorts, and I am wheeled about.
With the exception of my limbs and my breath, howsoever, I am as hearty
as a man can be, I’m thankful to say.’

‘Oh dear!’ said the latter, ‘I feel alarmingly faint; it’s very
singular.’ (It certainly was, for she had eaten four pounds of solids
that morning.) ‘By-the-bye,’ said Mrs. Bloss, ‘I have not seen Mr.
What’s-his-name yet.’

‘They wouldn’t have dared to do it, love,’ responded the lady.

“Wants me!  Who is it?”

Your village oracle, seated on his throne--the old oaken bench under
the village elm-tree, after his weekly labours, on the Saturday night
embalming his tongue in the aroma of the fragrant weed, and bribing his
lips into complacent humour by sips from the chirping old October, is
truly _great_. He is surrounded by listeners who love to pay homage to
his power. Whilst he whiffs, they consult him on great interests,--it
may be respecting the destiny of nations, or the desolating march of
hostile armies,--it may be on the devastations of the turnip-fly.
He lays his pipe aside; his words issue, like the syllables of the
Pythoness, in the midst of fragrant fumes. They fix at once the
unsettled,--they establish the doubtful,--they convict the speculative.

‘And you?’

But his Uncle was not to be left alone in the little back parlour,
where he was then sitting by himself; for Captain Cuttle, considerate
in his roughness, stayed away against his will, purposely that they
should have some talk together unobserved: so Walter, newly returned
home from his last day’s bustle, descended briskly, to bear him
company.

‘If she thought so, she judged rightly,’ replied Abel. ‘I consider her
request as a sacred injunction, and will strive to comply with it. And
now,’ he added, changing his tone, ‘I must tell you that your name has
been brought before me of late. My nephew, Randulph Crew, who visited
your father the other night, has spoken of you.’ Hilda slightly
coloured. ‘He will much regret not being at home this morning,’ pursued
Abel, ‘as he might have had an opportunity of further cultivating his
acquaintance with you. But he is gone out with my brother.’

It was clear that Colonel Diver, in the security of his strong position,
and in his perfect understanding of the public sentiment, cared very
little what Martin or anybody else thought about him. His high-spiced
wares were made to sell, and they sold; and his thousands of readers
could as rationally charge their delight in filth upon him, as a glutton
can shift upon his cook the responsibility of his beastly excess.
Nothing would have delighted the colonel more than to be told that
no such man as he could walk in high success the streets of any other
country in the world; for that would only have been a logical assurance
to him of the correct adaptation of his labours to the prevailing taste,
and of his being strictly and peculiarly a national feature of America.

The Captain seemed to make an endeavour to rise from the depths of his
astonishment, and get back to his face; but the effort being
ineffectual, the glazed hat merely nodded with a mute, unutterable
meaning.

He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon
him with a face, in which in some strange way there were
fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.

‘So shall I,’ said Mr. Alfred Jingle, drawing one arm through Mr.
Pickwick’s, and another through Mr. Wardle’s, as he whispered
confidentially in the ear of the former gentleman:--

Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the
thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the
numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded,
twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many
invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they
were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane
into Holborn.

Procter's Poems, which was published after her death.

She sat immovable beside me; but, again I saw the stray tears on her
face.

‘That’s right,’ said Squeers; ‘and if he has a touch of pride about him,
as I think he has, I don’t believe there’s woman in all England that can
bring anybody’s spirit down, as quick as you can, my love.’

[Sidenote: Mr. W. C. Macready.]

“So it is,” acquiesced Mr. Claypole. “An’t yer fond of oysters?”

‘Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?’ thundered Mr. Claypole.

“Never owed her a penny, Wal”r,” said Captain Cuttle, in a low voice,
and with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance. “Done her a
world of good turns, and the children too. Vixen at times, though.
Whew!”

‘Go further away from the leg of mutton, or you’ll be picking it, I
know,’ said Miss Sally.

CHAPTER SIX

“Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,
had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am
informed of the circumstances?”

Kind regards to all at Brighton.

"What a sarcastic smile," said the admiring Rachael; "I declare I'm
quite afraid of you."

"The dead letters, of course," said the bagman.

Mrs. Crummles rang the bell. ‘Let the mutton and onion sauce appear.’

This tone, though not what he had expected, on the whole suited Mr
Dorrit remarkably well. It showed that the gentleman, highly connected,
and not a mere workman, would be under an obligation to him. He
expressed his satisfaction in placing himself in Mr Gowan’s hands, and
trusted that he would have the pleasure, in their characters of private
gentlemen, of improving his acquaintance.

‘I am the Ghost of Art,’ said he.  ‘Two bob a-day now, and more when it’s
longer!  Hair’s the true expression.  There is no other.  I SAID I’D GROW
IT, AND I’VE GROWN IT, AND IT SHALL HAUNT YOU!’

26, WELLINGTON STREET, _Tuesday, 16th March, 1869._

Woodruffe threw himself back in his chair. It was too much to expect
that he would immediately rally; but he let the young people confer, and
plan, and cheer each other.

He hastily descended as the room-door opened, and the girl came out.
Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and
they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place
of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.

Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had
forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the
footstool, or he wouldn't have done it, on any account.

Let us not mistake the passion of Biddy Tibs; it was not the ruin of
her niece grieved her,--no! she could get another servant from the
workhouse; but she had fattened on the idea that, Lucretia as Lauretta
was, she had at length stumbled on a Tarquin!--it was wine and oil to
her heart. But, to find herself cozened, to have hatched the wrong
egg!--her fury knew no bounds. She raved, and--we trust, for the
first time in her life--uttered curses, and in so wild a scream that
neighbours came running to her assistance; when, lashed by her own
temper, the amiable Biddy Tibs fell down in a swoon, having burst a
blood-vessel, and was carried to bed.

‘He always falls down when he’s took out o’ the cab,’ continued the
driver, ‘but when he’s in it, we bears him up werry tight, and takes him
in werry short, so as he can’t werry well fall down; and we’ve got a
pair o’ precious large wheels on, so ven he does move, they run after
him, and he must go on--he can’t help it.’

The younger man glances at the portrait. The elder sees it in him.

[Illustration: _"If you'll have the kindness to settle that little bill
of mine I'll thank you"_]

‘The devil it won’t!’

‘Where am I?’ asks Mr Wegg.

Bella playfully setting herself about the task, Mrs Wilfer’s impressive
countenance followed her with glaring eyes, presenting a combination
of the once popular sign of the Saracen’s Head, with a piece of
Dutch clock-work, and suggesting to an imaginative mind that from the
composition of the salad, her daughter might prudently omit the vinegar.
But no word issued from the majestic matron’s lips. And this was more
terrific to her husband (as perhaps she knew) than any flow of eloquence
with which she could have edified the company.

"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic
behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of
women and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and
the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When
he had gone, D---- came from the window, whither I had followed him
immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterward I bade
him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay."

"Hear my tale! I come of a noble Italian family,--the noblest, ay,
in Venice. We were free once, and rich, and happy; but the Prussian
autograph has planted his banner on our towers,--the talents of his
haughty heagle have seized our wealth, and consigned most of our race
to dungeons. I am not a prisoner, only an exile. A mother, a bed-ridden
grandmother, and five darling sisters, escaped with me from Venice, and
now share my poverty and my home. But I have wrestled with misfortune
in vain; I have struggled with want, till want has overcome me.
Adeliza, I WANT BREAD!

Bella was so fluttered by the request, and by the short narrative he had
feelingly given her, that there never was a more timely smelling-bottle
than John’s knock. ‘My husband,’ said Bella; ‘I’ll bring him in.’

‘I tell you,’ said the ‘prentice, ‘his days are numbered. Leave me. Get
along with you.’

‘Harry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach
with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,’ replied the
doctor, ‘and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first
party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.’

‘I am very glad of any cause, sir,’ said the Notary, ‘which procures me
the honour of this visit.’

“’Scuse the liberty, Sir,” said Toodle, seeing he was not clearly
remembered, “but my wife Polly, as was called Richards in your family—”

Mr. Lamps demonstrated in action what this meant, by pulling out his oily
handkerchief rolled up in the form of a ball, and giving himself an
elaborate smear, from behind the right ear, up the cheek, across the
forehead, and down the other cheek to behind his left ear.  After this
operation he shone exceedingly.

‘It’s dreadful to think of!’ said the lady, shuddering.

‘Is it about her, mother, that you wished to speak to me?’ said Nicholas
quietly.

The answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it,
that Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair, to contemplate the
fire which so engrossed her, from her point of view, and see what he
could make of it.

That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received
it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the
hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
to its knitting again.

Some lock below gurgled in _its_ throat immediately afterwards, and then
a door crashed. Slow steps began ascending the stairs; the prattle of
a sweet little voice mingled with the noise they made; and the
prison-keeper appeared carrying his daughter, three or four years old,
and a basket.

‘Have you, sir?’

ROMANCE.  FROM THE PEN OF MISS ALICE RAINBIRD {258}

‘No,’ replied Nicholas.

[Illustration: "_I won't suffer this barrow to be moved another step
unless Winkle carries that gun of his in a different manner._"]

Still the younger sister looked into her eyes, and turned not—even
towards him.  And still those honest eyes looked back, so calm, serene,
and cheerful, on herself and on her lover.

‘Why does he lie upon the ground?’

It was a tentative reply, the man having a seafaring appearance. Her
father was not at home, and Pleasant knew it. ‘Take a seat by the fire,’
were her hospitable words when she had got him in; ‘men of your calling
are always welcome here.’

‘I was coming from my work just now, along the path outside (I was up
with the night-hands last night), and I heard a groan, and found you
lying here.’

It happened, fortunately for the elucidation of any intelligible result,
that Mr Dorrit had heard or read nothing about the matter. This
caused Mrs Finching, with many apologies for being in great practical
difficulties as to finding the way to her pocket among the stripes of
her dress at length to produce a police handbill, setting forth that
a foreign gentleman of the name of Blandois, last from Venice, had
unaccountably disappeared on such a night in such a part of the city of
London; that he was known to have entered such a house, at such an hour;
that he was stated by the inmates of that house to have left it, about
so many minutes before midnight; and that he had never been beheld
since. This, with exact particulars of time and locality, and with
a good detailed description of the foreign gentleman who had so
mysteriously vanished, Mr Dorrit read at large.

"Dear _me_, I vish it vos, my dear," replied Sam, dropping behind to
let his master get out of hearing. "Wot a sweet-looking creetur you
are, Mary!"

“If I am ordered to dine, of course I will, sir,” was the gloomy
answer.

All at once—in the first-floor window on my right—down in a low corner,
at a hole in a blind or a shutter—I found that I was looking at a secret
Eye.  The reflection of my fire may have touched it and made it shine;
but, I saw it shine and vanish.

The envelope was directed to blank Weller, Esq., at Mr. Pickwick’s; and
in a parenthesis, in the left hand corner, were the words ‘airy bell,’
as an instruction to the bearer.

‘You are a nice fellow to talk of flying off, Steerforth, who are always
running wild on some unknown expedition or other!’

"I deny that," said the other: "on the contrary, it comes of your
no-reform."

‘Brother Ned,’ said Mr. Cheeryble, tapping with his knuckles, and
stooping to listen, ‘are you busy, my dear brother, or can you spare
time for a word or two with me?’

‘Rosa, I have forgotten this gentleman’s name.’

CHAPTER 29 -- IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE PRECOCIOUS, OTHERS PROFESSIONAL, AND OTHERS MYSTERIOUS; ALL IN THEIR SEVERAL WAYS

The tone of kindness in which this was said, somewhat re-assured the
lover, so he made an effort to speak, and got as far as, "I'm not
well."

‘Yes,’ replied the man. ‘The very book he has in his hand.’

"I'll tell you what," said Grimaldi, "we'll go to the public-house, and
ask the landlord whether it's a good one, or not. They always know."

‘And speaking of satisfactory,’ pursued Mr Boffin, ‘why, Lord save
us! when we come to take it to pieces, bit by bit, where’s the
satisfactoriness of the money as yet? When the old man does right the
poor boy after all, the poor boy gets no good of it. He gets made away
with, at the moment when he’s lifting (as one may say) the cup and
sarser to his lips. Mr Lightwood, I will now name to you, that on behalf
of the poor dear boy, me and Mrs Boffin have stood out against the old
man times out of number, till he has called us every name he could lay
his tongue to. I have seen him, after Mrs Boffin has given him her mind
respecting the claims of the nat’ral affections, catch off Mrs Boffin’s
bonnet (she wore, in general, a black straw, perched as a matter of
convenience on the top of her head), and send it spinning across
the yard. I have indeed. And once, when he did this in a manner that
amounted to personal, I should have given him a rattler for himself, if
Mrs Boffin hadn’t thrown herself betwixt us, and received flush on the
temple. Which dropped her, Mr Lightwood. Dropped her.’

“Yes, guardian. Innocently, but most surely. That secluded sister is
my first remembrance.”

It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to
present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation,
as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero
sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes;
in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the
audience with a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the
heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and
her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve
the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are
wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are
straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a
grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of
vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to
palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.

‘It’s a steamer, Miss Abbey,’ cried one blurred figure in the fog.

The quarrel appearing to terminate with this reply, Mrs. Lillyvick
considered that the fittest occasion (the attention of the company being
no longer distracted) to burst into tears, and require the assistance of
all four bridesmaids, which was immediately rendered, though not without
some confusion, for the room being small and the table-cloth long, a
whole detachment of plates were swept off the board at the very first
move. Regardless of this circumstance, however, Mrs. Lillyvick refused
to be comforted until the belligerents had passed their words that the
dispute should be carried no further, which, after a sufficient show of
reluctance, they did, and from that time Mr. Folair sat in moody silence,
contenting himself with pinching Nicholas’s leg when anything was said,
and so expressing his contempt both for the speaker and the sentiments
to which he gave utterance.

‘Talk aboot soom’at else,’ replied John, gruffly, ‘and dinnot bother.’

"Because, sir," said Mr. Pickwick, considerably excited, "because you
are too old, sir."

The little hands could meet each other now, without a rampant horse
to urge them. There was no occasion for lions, bears, or mad bulls. It
could all be done, and infinitely better, without their assistance.
No burly drayman or big butts of beer, were wanted for apologies. No
apology at all was wanted. The soft light touch fell coyly, but quite
naturally, upon the lover’s shoulder; the delicate waist, the drooping
head, the blushing cheek, the beautiful eyes, the exquisite mouth
itself, were all as natural as possible. If all the horses in Araby had
run away at once, they couldn’t have improved upon it.

“Or he keeps us,” suggested Richard.

"My dear," said Bob, "the children! Christmas Day."

But the ecstasies of Mrs Gamp were sufficient to have furnished forth
a score of young lovers; and they were chiefly awakened by the sight of
Tom Pinch and his sister. Mrs Gamp was a lady of that happy temperament
which can be ecstatic without any other stimulating cause than a general
desire to establish a large and profitable connection. She added daily
so many strings to her bow, that she made a perfect harp of it; and upon
that instrument she now began to perform an extemporaneous concerto.

‘No, no, mama, never,’ replied Kate. And to do Mrs. Nickleby justice, she
never had lost--and to do married ladies as a body justice, they seldom
do lose--any occasion of inculcating similar golden percepts, whose only
blemish is, the slight degree of vagueness and uncertainty in which they
are usually enveloped.

He invariably heard of Minnie from them, as telling them in her letters
how happy she was, and how she loved her husband; but inseparable from
that subject, he invariably saw the old cloud on Mr Meagles’s face. Mr
Meagles had never been quite so radiant since the marriage as before.
He had never quite recovered the separation from Pet. He was the same
good-humoured, open creature; but as if his face, from being much turned
towards the pictures of his two children which could show him only one
look, unconsciously adopted a characteristic from them, it always had
now, through all its changes of expression, a look of loss in it.

Tom found the chapter, and read it in the high-pitched voice which is
customary in village-schools. His mother bent forward, her lips parted,
her eyes dilated; her whole body instinct with eager attention. Will sat
with his head depressed, and hung down. He knew why that chapter had
been chosen; and to him it recalled the family’s disgrace. When the
reading was ended, he still hung down his head in gloomy silence. But
her face was brighter than it had been before for the day. Her eyes
looked dreamy, as if she saw a vision; and by-and-bye she pulled the
Bible towards her, and putting her finger underneath each word, began to
read them aloud in a low voice to herself; she read again the words of
bitter sorrow and deep humiliation; but most of all she paused and
brightened over the father’s tender reception of the repentant prodigal.

He pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped the drops from his heated
forehead.

‘It is only that I feel a little overcome by your kindness, and by Mr
Clennam’s kindness in confiding me to one he has known and loved so
long.’

“And what d’ye mean to do with Wal”r?” said the Captain. “There, there!
Sit ye down, Gills, sit ye down, and let me think o’ this. If I warn’t
a man on a small annuity, that was large enough till today, I hadn’t
need to think of it. But you only lay your head well to the wind,” said
the Captain, again administering that unanswerable piece of
consolation, “and you’re all right!”

{1}  Dicken's didn't write chapters three and four and they are omitted
in this edition.  The story continues with Captain Jorgan and Alfred at
Lanrean.

Again this quarter passed, they came upon a straggling neighbourhood,
where the mean houses parcelled off in rooms, and windows patched with
rags and paper, told of the populous poverty that sheltered there.  The
shops sold goods that only poverty could buy, and sellers and buyers
were pinched and griped alike.  Here were poor streets where faded
gentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its
last feeble stand, but tax-gatherer and creditor came there as
elsewhere, and the poverty that yet faintly struggled was hardly less
squalid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given
up the game.

‘Truly, sir, I fear I nodded,’ said the old man.

My fair friend rose to leave us. Her shawl caught in the chair, and I
was struck with the striking change a few years had effected in my old
playfellow. She was grown absolutely stout. I involuntarily noticed it.

"Em'ly's run away! Oh, Mas'r Davy, think _how_ she's run away, when I
pray my good and gracious God to kill her (her that is so dear above all
things) sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace!"

SOMEBODY'S LUGGAGE

HER situation was indeed one of no common trial and difficulty, for
while she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the
mystery in which Oliver’s history was enveloped, she could not but
hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had
just conversed had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her
words and manner had touched Rose Maylie’s heart, and mingled with her
love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and
fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and
hope.

Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from
taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed,
muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating
his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and
requested him to close it softly, while he got a light.

“A bad son, I am afraid?” said Mr Carker.

Tilly was hushing the Baby, and she crossed and re-crossed Tackleton, a
dozen times, repeating drowsily:

“Thank you,” returned Mr. Guppy. “Very honourable, I am sure. I
regret that my arrangements in life, combined with circumstances over
which I have no control, will put it out of my power ever to fall
back upon that offer or to renew it in any shape or form whatever,
but it will ever be a retrospect entwined—er—with friendship’s
bowers.” Mr. Guppy’s bronchitis came to his relief and stopped his
measurement of the table.

Tip idled away in the law office for six months, then came back to the
prison one evening with his hands in his pockets and told his sister he
was not going back again.

‘No!’

“What’s a Sawbones?” inquired Mr. Pickwick, not quite certain whether it
was a live animal, or something to eat.

“These fits come over me, now and then,” said Monks, observing his
alarm; “and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don’t mind me now; it’s
all over for this once.”

‘Very good, Sir,’ responded Mrs. Raddle, with lofty politeness. ‘Then
p’raps, Sir, you’ll confine yourself to breaking the arms and legs of
the poor people in the hospitals, and keep yourself _to_ yourself, Sir,
or there may be some persons here as will make you, Sir.’

With hands trembling with delight, Squeers unloosened the cord; and
Smike, to all appearance more dead than alive, was brought into the
house and securely locked up in a cellar, until such time as Mr. Squeers
should deem it expedient to operate upon him, in presence of the
assembled school.

‘How was that?’

“If my charming girl inherits any advantages from me, wicked one!”: the
Major was the wicked one: “she inherits also my foolish nature. She has
great force of character—mine has been said to be immense, though I
don’t believe it—but once moved, she is susceptible and sensitive to
the last extent. What are my feelings when I see her pining! They
destroy me.

I began, by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted; all sorts of
half-forgotten things to talk about, came rushing into my mind, and made
me hold forth in a most unwonted manner. I laughed heartily at my own
jokes, and everybody else’s; called Steerforth to order for not passing
the wine; made several engagements to go to Oxford; announced that
I meant to have a dinner-party exactly like that, once a week, until
further notice; and madly took so much snuff out of Grainger’s box, that
I was obliged to go into the pantry, and have a private fit of sneezing
ten minutes long.

“What sort of person?”

This reference to the coat of no cut and no time, the unfortunate
gentleman gasped forth, in a scarcely audible voice, and with his
clenched pocket-handkerchief raised in the air. His excited feelings
might have found some further painful utterance, but for a knock at the
door, which had been already twice repeated, and to which Fanny (still
wishing herself dead, and indeed now going so far as to add, buried)
cried ‘Come in!’

‘Then, you see, Clara,’ returns Miss Murdstone, ‘you should just give
him the book back, and make him know it.’

“And the least given to peaching,” added Charley Bates.

Poor Will told him how he could not make a living in the country, and
had come to London with his orphan niece to try to find a friend of her
mother's and to endeavor to get some work, and, wishing Toby a happy New
Year, was about to trudge wearily off again, when Trotty caught his
hand, saying--

They bade him farewell very many times, and turned away, walking slowly
and often looking back, until they could see him no more.  At length
they had left the village far behind, and even lost sight of the smoke
among the trees.  They trudged onward now, at a quicker pace, resolving
to keep the main road, and go wherever it might lead them.

‘What _do_ you advise?’

‘The more reason why you should take some support, sir,’ urged Young
John. ‘If you find yourself going on sitting here for hours and hours
partaking of no refreshment because you have no appetite, why then you
should and must partake of refreshment without an appetite. I’m going to
have tea in my own apartment. If it’s not a liberty, please to come and
take a cup. Or I can bring a tray here in two minutes.’

‘Only sighed, and dropped his head, and seemed so sad and wretched that
if you could have seen him I am sure you must have cried; you could not
have helped it more than I, I know. How that door creaks!’

‘Mr Clennam, Fanny. My eldest daughter and my son, Mr Clennam. The bell
is a signal for visitors to retire, and so they have come to say good
night; but there is plenty of time, plenty of time. Girls, Mr Clennam
will excuse any household business you may have together. He knows, I
dare say, that I have but one room here.’

‘What _can_ he mean by this?’ said Mr. Snodgrass, when the horse had
executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time.

‘—Are you of opinion that your cousin, Lord Snigsworth, would give his
name as a Member of my Committee? I don’t go so far as to ask for his
lordship; I only ask for his name. Do you think he would give me his
name?’

His eyes fell again on the bottle, and a tremble passed over him, causing
him to shiver in every limb.  She thought he was chilled with the wet.
‘No,’ he said, ‘it was not that.  He had had a fright.’

And equally ill-befitting would be any serious allusion to those
passions and feelings which in their violence or their anguish
render the human bosom a lazar-house filled with maladies of the
mind as racking and as wasting as those of the body, and call forth
a supplication for the releasing blow of Death as the final hope,
with an earnestness as desperate, and cry as loud as ever arose from
the tenement, sad, noisome, and dark, which holds the joint-racked
victims of physical disease. Such themes should not sadden the festive
banquet in the forest. The Duke and his co-mates and partners in exile,
reconciled to their present mode of life, ["I would not change it," says
Amiens, speaking, we may suppose, the sentiments of all,] and successful
in having plucked the precious jewel, content, from the head of ugly and
venomous Adversity, are ready to bestow their woodland fare upon real
suffering, but in no mood to listen to the heart-rending descriptions of
sorrows graver than those which form a theme for the discourses which
Jaques in mimic melancholy contributes to their amusement.

It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our
own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and
hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a
bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see
his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly
and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come
back.

Age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds
much consideration among the poor.  The old woman was so decent and
contented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had
increased upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that they
both took an interest in her.  She was too sprightly to allow of their
walking at a slow pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be
talked to, and very willing to talk to any extent: so, when they came to
their part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious than ever.

Finally, the Captain left off biting his nails, and said, “Now, Wal”r,
my boy, you may help me on with them slops.” By which the Captain meant
his coat and waistcoat.

‘At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?’ said I.

“Well,” said the doctor, laughing heartily, “that is no very difficult
matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is
yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I
have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn’t
be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse
with him without danger. Now I make this stipulation—that I shall
examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we
judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he
is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall
be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at
all events.”

Was Augustus George intended to have limbs, or to be born a Torso?  I
presume that limbs were the intention, as they are the usual practice.
Then, why are my poor child’s limbs fettered and tied up?  Am I to be
told that there is any analogy between Augustus George Meek and Jack
Sheppard?

The gipsy produced three tin cups, and filled them to the brim with
brandy.  The old man turned aside and muttered to himself before he
drank.  Her own name struck upon the listener’s ear, coupled with some
wish so fervent, that he seemed to breathe it in an agony of
supplication.

"It's humbug, still!" said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."

“The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. ‘Doctor,
your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to
enter the carriage?’

London:
        CHAPMAN AND HALL, 193, PICCADILLY.
        1880.

‘I don’t know how it can be,’ said Mr. Dick, sorely puzzled and shaking
his head. ‘I don’t think I am as old as that.’

He was forced to comply; and the unhappy Ude (_udus_), his face and
white jacket streaming with the contents of the _plat_, was followed
out of the room with hisses and bursts of laughter.

‘Have been!’ cried the dwarf, looking suspiciously at his companion.
‘Through whose means?’

Jasper sets the example of nearly emptying his glass, and Neville
follows it. Edwin Drood says, “Thank you both very much,” and follows
the double example.

Arthur Clennam looked at Little Dorrit with the expression of one
saying, ‘May I ask who this is?’ Little Dorrit, whose hand this Maggy,
still calling her little mother, had begun to fondle, answered in words
(they were under a gateway into which the majority of the potatoes had
rolled).

The sea had ebbed and flowed through a whole year.  Through a whole year
the winds and clouds had come and gone; the ceaseless work of Time had
been performed, in storm and sunshine.  Through a whole year the famous
House of Dombey and Son had fought a fight for life, against doubtful
rumors, unsuccessful ventures, and most of all, against the bad judgment
of its head, who would not contract its enterprises by a hair's breadth,
and would not listen to a word of warning that the ship he strained so
hard against the storm was weak, and could not bear it.

“Of course! Surely you do not mean to insinuate that you have seen his
ghost!”

I got into such a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat was not
a little shabby already. I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the
forest of difficulty, under circumstances that should prove my strength.
I had a good mind to ask an old man, in wire spectacles, who was
breaking stones upon the road, to lend me his hammer for a little while,
and let me begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite. I stimulated
myself into such a heat, and got so out of breath, that I felt as if I
had been earning I don’t know how much.

Finding her still very restless about him, they made him up a bed in an
inner room. The key of this chamber was on that side of the door which
was in Nell's room; the poor child turned it on him when the landlady
had gone, and crept to bed again with a thankful heart.

‘There may be something in that, too, sir,’ answered Mark. ‘But that’s
no consolation.’

"Yes," said the Jew; "that is, unless they should unexpectedly come
across any when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do, my
dear, depend upon it. Make 'em your models, my dear. Make 'em your
models," tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his
words; "do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all
matters--especially the Dodger's my dear. He'll be a great man himself,
and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him. Is my
handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?" said the Jew, stopping
short.

Little Mr. Chillip the Doctor, to whose good offices I was indebted in
the very first chapter of this history, sat reading a newspaper in the
shadow of an opposite corner. He was tolerably stricken in years by this
time; but, being a mild, meek, calm little man, had worn so easily, that
I thought he looked at that moment just as he might have looked when he
sat in our parlour, waiting for me to be born.

“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must
be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones?”

‘Well, _that’s_ sing’ler!’ said Mr. Joseph Tuggs again. Miss Charlotta
coughed this time, and another pause ensued. It was agreeably broken.

‘Yes, sir.’

"Then you ought to be able to afford it, sir," said the judge,
reddening; for Mr. Justice Stareleigh's temper bordered on the
irritable, and brooked no contradiction.

So after he had been a little while with Ada, I went in and found my
darling (as I knew she would be) prepared to consider him thoroughly
right in whatever he said.

The door is opened.  Breathless expectation.  The lady of the family gets
out.  Ah sweet lady!  Beautiful lady!  The sister of the lady of the
family gets out.  Great Heaven, Ma’amselle is charming!  First little boy
gets out.  Ah, what a beautiful little boy!  First little girl gets out.
Oh, but this is an enchanting child!  Second little girl gets out.  The
landlady, yielding to the finest impulse of our common nature, catches
her up in her arms!  Second little boy gets out.  Oh, the sweet boy!  Oh,
the tender little family!  The baby is handed out.  Angelic baby!  The
baby has topped everything.  All the rapture is expended on the baby!
Then the two nurses tumble out; and the enthusiasm swelling into madness,
the whole family are swept up-stairs as on a cloud; while the idlers
press about the carriage, and look into it, and walk round it, and touch
it.  For it is something to touch a carriage that has held so many
people.  It is a legacy to leave one’s children.

While these affairs were in abeyance, our visit to Mr. Boythorn’s was
postponed. At length, Richard having taken possession of his lodging,
there was nothing to prevent our departure. He could have gone with
us at that time of the year very well, but he was in the full novelty
of his new position and was making most energetic attempts to unravel
the mysteries of the fatal suit. Consequently we went without him,
and my darling was delighted to praise him for being so busy.

THE COURT.

"Why, how's this?" muttered the Jew, changing countenance; "only two of
'em! Where's the third? They can't have got into trouble. Hark!"

"How did those stones come here?"

“That’s worse. But why, mother?”

"I shall go as a bandit," interposed Mr. Tupman.

"I'm afraid I shall hurt you, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick.

“Very good,” replied Mr. Brownlow smiling, “but no doubt they will
bring that about themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in
to forestal them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very
Quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interest, or at least to
Oliver’s, which is the same thing.”

This was the previous history of the Lancashire family who had now
removed to London, and had come to occupy the House.

Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words,
she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing
herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm. He was still more
astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all
the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and
collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her,
steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully. But he
was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under
trying circumstances. How should he, when their possessors so seldom
know themselves?

‘Eloped!—Who with—when—where—how?’ almost shrieked the agitated
diplomatist.

“Why, Captain, look here! this is--is--” holding out the dirty scrap of
paper.

There was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it. There was not one
gleam of interest, parental recognition, or relenting in it. There was
a change in it, but not of that kind. The old indifference and cold
constraint had given place to something: what, she never thought and
did not dare to think, and yet she felt it in its force, and knew it
well without a name: that as it looked upon her, seemed to cast a
shadow on her head.

Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, and the room was
his own. Best and happiest of all, the time before him was his own, to
make amends in!

‘Thank you,’ returned Arthur. ‘Not a morsel.’

‘Well! Anyways I says it again. Sleep where you slept last; the sounder
and longer you can sleep, the better you’ll know arterwards what you’re
up to.’

"_I_ ask her to dance! I never danced in my life!" and for the first
time Armand felt that this was a deficiency in his education. However,
he went and stood close to the beauty, watching an opportunity of
entering into conversation with her. Once he was on the very point
of succeeding, when a young man came up, and led her away to the
quadrille. Poor Armand bit his lips, and was obliged again to content
himself with admiring her dancing. This whole evening he made no
further advances, but he did not lose sight of his enchantress for an
instant.

_Mrs. C._ (_In a faltering voice._) I have known him walk with--I have
known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed.

'Quite so,' replied that gentleman.

Then the play itself! the horses which little Jacob believed from the
first to be alive, and the ladies and gentlemen of whose reality he
could be by no means persuaded, having never seen or heard anything at
all like them--the firing, which made Barbara wink--the forlorn lady,
who made her cry--the tyrant, who made her tremble--the man who sang
the song with the lady’s-maid and danced the chorus, who made her
laugh--the pony who reared up on his hind legs when he saw the
murderer, and wouldn’t hear of walking on all fours again until he was
taken into custody--the clown who ventured on such familiarities with
the military man in boots--the lady who jumped over the nine-and-twenty
ribbons and came down safe upon the horse’s back--everything was
delightful, splendid, and surprising!  Little Jacob applauded till his
hands were sore; Kit cried ‘an-kor’ at the end of everything, the
three-act piece included; and Barbara’s mother beat her umbrella on the
floor, in her ecstasies, until it was nearly worn down to the gingham.

After carefully cross-examining my daughter, I do NOT believe her to be
worthy of the fernery. Last autumn we transplanted into the shrubbery a
quantity of evergreens previously clustered close to the front of the
house, and trained more ivy about the wall and the like. When I ask her
where she would have the fernery and what she would do with it, the
witness falters, turns pale, becomes confused, and says: "Perhaps it
would be better not to have it at all." I am quite confident that the
constancy of the young person is not to be trusted, and that she had
better attach her fernery to one of her châteaux in Spain, or one of her
English castles in the air. None the less do I thank you for your more
than kind proposal.

[Sidenote: Mr. Alexander Ireland.]

“Miss Manette, then!”

_Fred._ No.

“Humph,” said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on
the Jew’s side than on his. “Well, what have you got to say to me?”

"Let me out!" shrieked Sarah.

Murtough Murphy was a great character, as may be guessed from his
letter. He was a country attorney of good practice;--good, because
he could not help it,--for he was a clever, ready-witted fellow, up
to all sorts of trap, and one in whose hands a cause was very safe;
therefore he had plenty of clients without his seeking them. For,
if Murtough's practice had depended on his looking for it, he might
have made broth of his own parchment; for though, to all intents and
purposes, a good attorney, he was so full of fun and fond of amusement,
that it was only by dint of the business being thrust upon him he was
so extensive a practitioner. He loved a good bottle, a good hunt, a
good joke, and a good song, as well as any fellow in Ireland; and
even when he was obliged in the way of business to press a gentleman
hard,--to hunt his man to the death,--he did it so good-humouredly that
his very victim could not be angry with him. As for those he served,
he was their prime favourite; there was nothing they _could_ want to
be done in the parchment line that Murtough would not find out some
way of doing; and he was so pleasant a fellow, that he shared in the
hospitality of all the best tables in the county. He kept good horses,
was on every race-ground within twenty miles, and a steeple-chase was
no steeple-chase without him. Then he betted freely, and, what's more,
won his bets very generally; but no one found fault with him for that,
and he took your money with such a good grace, and mostly gave you
a _bon-mot_ in exchange for it,--so that, next to winning the money
yourself, you were glad it was won by Murtough Murphy.

The coaxing tone in which he said these latter words might have failed
in its object, if he had not accompanied them with sundry sharp jerks of
his thumb over one shoulder, and with divers winks and thrustings of his
tongue into his cheek, from which signals the damsel gathered that he
sought to speak to her apart, concerning Miss Haredale and Dolly. Her
curiosity being very powerful, and her jealousy by no means inactive,
she arose, and with a great deal of shivering and starting back, and
much muscular action among all the small bones in her throat, gradually
approached him.

"My dear," said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, "this is the boy from the
workhouse that I told you of." Oliver bowed again.

"No," replied Mr. Winkle, dropping on his knees, "Mrs. Winkle. Pardon,
my dear friend, pardon!"

"'I shall make no such declaration,' said Clavijo, almost inarticulate
from agitation.

So, Julius Cæsar came sailing over to this Island of ours, with eighty
vessels and twelve thousand men. And he came from the French coast
between Calais and Boulogne, ‘because thence was the shortest passage
into Britain;’ just for the same reason as our steam-boats now take the
same track, every day. He expected to conquer Britain easily: but it
was not such easy work as he supposed—for the bold Britons fought most
bravely; and, what with not having his horse-soldiers with him (for
they had been driven back by a storm), and what with having some of his
vessels dashed to pieces by a high tide after they were drawn ashore,
he ran great risk of being totally defeated. However, for once that the
bold Britons beat him, he beat them twice; though not so soundly but
that he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace, and go away.

"What do they catch?"

‘I haven’t been, I hope, a very unjust steward in the execution of my
trust,’ pursued the Doctor; ‘but I am to be, at any rate, formally
discharged, and released, and what not this morning; and here are our
good friends Snitchey and Craggs, with a bagful of papers, and accounts,
and documents, for the transfer of the balance of the trust fund to you
(I wish it was a more difficult one to dispose of, Alfred, but you must
get to be a great man and make it so), and other drolleries of that sort,
which are to be signed, sealed, and delivered.’

‘Mary,’ said Mr. Muzzle to the pretty servant-girl, ‘this is Mr. Weller;
a gentleman as master has sent down, to be made as comfortable as
possible.’

‘Then, what would you do, Joe?’ pursued the locksmith, stroking his chin
reflectively. ‘What could you be? Where could you go, you see?’

‘Prefer to keep him!’ he echoed. ‘These people, who go tramping about
the country a-pilfering and vagabondising on all hands, prefer to keep
a bird, when a landed proprietor and a justice asks his price! That old
woman’s been to school. I know she has. Don’t tell me no,’ he roared to
the widow, ‘I say, yes.’

‘I’m in an uncommon ill humour, if that’s it,’ rejoined the Model, with
great indignation.  ‘As if it warn’t bad enough for a bob a-hour, for a
man to be mixing himself up with that there jolly old furniter that one
‘ud think the public know’d the wery nails in by this time—or to be
putting on greasy old ‘ats and cloaks, and playing tambourines in the Bay
o’ Naples, with Wesuvius a smokin’ according to pattern in the
background, and the wines a bearing wonderful in the middle distance—or
to be unpolitely kicking up his legs among a lot o’ gals, with no reason
whatever in his mind but to show ’em—as if this warn’t bad enough, I’m to
go and be thrown out of employment too!’

“Oh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!”
exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket
and the street-door key in an agony of distress. “What has become of
him! Where have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what’s
been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please,
gentlemen!”

‘Martha,’ said the locksmith, turning to his wife, and shaking his head
sorrowfully, while a smile at the absurd figure beside him still played
upon his open face, ‘I trust it may turn out that this poor lad is not
the victim of the knaves and fools we have so often had words about, and
who have done so much harm to-day. If he has been at Warwick Street or
Duke Street to-night--’

Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton
flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.

Of all men they are most horribly superstitious, and, in consequence,
are victims also to superstitious horrors of the first magnitude. The
forest, or bush, the air, the streams, the ground, swarm with a surplus
population of Satan's imps and witches. Each moment and each step
expose the wayfarer to the gripe of some malicious fiend. To evade the
unwholesome clutch, the limbs are ornamented with charms and talismans,
with dead men's hair and leopards' teeth. To deprecate and conciliate
these animavorous specimens of African zoology no pains are spared, and
temples named "Devil-Houses" witness the placatory sacrifices to the
spirit of evil.

"To the devil, sir," faltered Doubledick.

After a little prophetic conversation with the policeman at the
street-corner, touching a probable change in the weather, and the
setting-in of a hard frost, the nine o’clock beer returns to his
master’s house, and employs himself for the remainder of the evening,
in assiduously stirring the tap-room fire, and deferentially taking
part in the conversation of the worthies assembled round it.

‘I _think _so,’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick, very properly guarding himself
against the possibility of stating an untruth; ‘mind, I could not
undertake to say certainly, without tasting it.’

God’s love upon thy patience, Tom! Who, that had beheld thee, for three
summer weeks, poring through half the deadlong night over the jingling
anatomy of that inscrutable old harpsichord in the back parlour, could
have missed the entrance to thy secret heart: albeit it was dimly known
to thee? Who that had seen the glow upon thy cheek when leaning down to
listen, after hours of labour, for the sound of one incorrigible note,
thou foundest that it had a voice at last, and wheezed out a flat
something, distantly akin to what it ought to be, would not have known
that it was destined for no common touch, but one that smote, though
gently as an angel’s hand, upon the deepest chord within thee! And if
a friendly glance--aye, even though it were as guileless as thine own,
Dear Tom--could have but pierced the twilight of that evening, when, in
a voice well tempered to the time, sad, sweet, and low, yet hopeful, she
first sang to the altered instrument, and wondered at the change;
and thou, sitting apart at the open window, kept a glad silence and a
swelling heart--must not that glance have read perforce the dawning of a
story, Tom, that it were well for thee had never been begun!

‘I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have always wished that you
should know it.  But you changed to me a little, shortly before you left
home.  Not that I wondered at it.  You knew so much, and I knew so
little, and it was so natural in many ways, going as you were among other
friends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.’

“What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she
leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “do
you reproach me for being cold? You?”

The captain gazed upon the gallant officer sorrowfully, and, as he shook
his head, his looks said as plainly as looks could speak, and with the
deepest pathos, "They never milked _his_ cow."

“And don’t blame _me_,” growled the convict I had recognised. “_I_
don’t want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am
concerned any one’s welcome to _my_ place.”

‘I thought so!’ said he. ‘I know _you_.’

‘Will you?’

‘They are here,’ added the count, tapping his forehead significantly.
‘Large book at home--full of notes--music, picture, science, potry,
poltic; all tings.’

"Ah! then, is it the Peelers," said Darby contemptuously, "that yir
honor manes? Divil a one o' them will be out of his _flay_-park by
the time I'm crossing the _Callas_ with Squib and Pat Fagan's ould
carbine, that he'll lend me out o' the bog-hole, where he keeps it from
the rust and the guagers: and sure, while we're oilin' it with a bit
of goose-grace, that it mayn't burst intirely the first goin' off, I
can have a bit of gossip with the ould woman in the chimly corner over
the _greeshah_, and find out everything about the gintleman in the
neighb'rhood that I'm takin' the letther to; for poor Katty Fagan, ever
since she lost the brindled heifer, and young Jemmeen her grandson, that
they cut out for a priest, and another calf that she won at a weddin'
raffle, all in the typhus s_a_son,--you recollect the typhus, yir honor?"

He repeated what he had already said.

P.S.--I have been waiting until I got to subjects of this nature,
thinking you would like them best.

The single gentleman among his other peculiarities--and he had a very
plentiful stock, of which he every day furnished some new
specimen--took a most extraordinary and remarkable interest in the
exhibition of Punch.  If the sound of a Punch’s voice, at ever so
remote a distance, reached Bevis Marks, the single gentleman, though in
bed and asleep, would start up, and, hurrying on his clothes, make for
the spot with all speed, and presently return at the head of a long
procession of idlers, having in the midst the theatre and its
proprietors.  Straightway, the stage would be set up in front of Mr
Brass’s house; the single gentleman would establish himself at the
first floor window; and the entertainment would proceed, with all its
exciting accompaniments of fife and drum and shout, to the excessive
consternation of all sober votaries of business in that silent
thoroughfare.  It might have been expected that when the play was done,
both players and audience would have dispersed; but the epilogue was as
bad as the play, for no sooner was the Devil dead, than the manager of
the puppets and his partner were summoned by the single gentleman to
his chamber, where they were regaled with strong waters from his
private store, and where they held with him long conversations, the
purport of which no human being could fathom.  But the secret of these
discussions was of little importance.  It was sufficient to know that
while they were proceeding, the concourse without still lingered round
the house; that boys beat upon the drum with their fists, and imitated
Punch with their tender voices; that the office-window was rendered
opaque by flattened noses, and the key-hole of the street-door luminous
with eyes; that every time the single gentleman or either of his guests
was seen at the upper window, or so much as the end of one of their
noses was visible, there was a great shout of execration from the
excluded mob, who remained howling and yelling, and refusing
consolation, until the exhibitors were delivered up to them to be
attended elsewhere.  It was sufficient, in short, to know that Bevis
Marks was revolutionised by these popular movements, and that peace and
quietness fled from its precincts.

GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER, KENT,
                                             _Monday, Jan. 4th, 1869._

‘What!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in a storm of indignation. Mr. Winkle
modestly repeated his suggestion.

I cannot tell you how grieved we all are here to know that you are
suffering again. Your patient tone, however, and the hopefulness and
forbearance of Ferguson's course, gives us some reassurance. Apropos of
which latter reference I dined with Ferguson at the Lord Mayor's, last
Tuesday, and had a grimly distracted impulse upon me to defy the
toast-master and rush into a speech about him and his noble art, when I
sat pining under the imbecility of constitutional and corporational
idiots. I did seize him for a moment by the hair of his head (in
proposing the Lady Mayoress), and derived some faint consolation from
the company's response to the reference. O! no man will ever know under
what provocation to contradiction and a savage yell of repudiation I
suffered at the hands of ----, feebly complacent in the uniform of
Madame Tussaud's own military waxers, and almost the worst speaker I
ever heard in my life! Mary and Georgina, sitting on either side of me,
urged me to "look pleasant." I replied in expressions not to be
repeated. Shea (the judge) was just as good and graceful, as he (the
member) was bad and gawky.

"Yes, sir."

‘TONY VELLER.’

‘And you know where she is gone,’ hazarded Fledgeby.

"It's been given out to brush," thought Mr. Pickwick, "and the man has
forgotten whom it belongs to. Mr. Winkle," he called out, "next room
but two, on the right hand."

There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while
it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of
things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as
an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter
inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called
sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is
going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which
are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment,
accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions,
until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is
afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two. Nor
is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. It
is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight
be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary
scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially
influenced, by the _mere silent presence_ of some external object;
which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of
whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.

"And, perhaps, my dear sir--" said the cautious little man, "perhaps if
you _could_--I don't mean to say it's indispensable--but if you _could_
manage to kiss one of 'em, it would produce a very great impression on
the crowd."

"Yes, indeed, sir!" said the enemy, with a look very like one of
triumph.

‘Mr. Copperfield,’ said Steerforth; ‘he wants to know you.’

[Illustration: "I'VE BROUGHT THIS HERE NOTE," REPLIED THE INDIVIDUAL IN
THE PAINTED TOPS IN A HOARSE WHISPER; "I'VE BROUGHT THIS HERE NOTE FROM
A GEN'L'M'N AS COME TO OUR HOUSE THIS MORNIN'."--_Tales_, Chap. x. 2]

I was not actively ill-used.  I was not beaten, or starved; but day by
day I was made to feel that I was in the way, and an altogether useless
member of society.  Finally Mr. Murdstone called me to him one day, and
told me that he could not afford to send me to school, but that I must
go to work for myself.  He had a partner in the wine trade in London,
and I was to be given a position there.

‘I came here by the Canterbury coach, today. I have been adopted by
an aunt down in that part of the country, and have just finished my
education there. How do YOU come to be here, Steerforth?’

“I won’t be ten minutes, sir,” replied Oliver, eagerly; and, having
buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books
carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room.
Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions
about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of
the street, all of which Oliver said he clearly understood; and, having
superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the careful
old lady at length permitted him to depart.

"The same."

"Miss Trotwood," said the visitor. "You have heard of her, I dare say?"

Master Marsh's brow grew dark; he half rose from his seat, supported
himself by both hands on the arms of his elbow-chair, and in accents of
mingled anger and astonishment repeated the word "Fidgety!"

‘Thank Heaven he is in his bed; having been up all night, as you know,
and on his feet all day. He was quite tired out. Ah, neighbour, if I
could but see him oftener so--if I could but tame down that terrible
restlessness--’

"I can readily imagine, my dear friend, how much this overbearing
conduct of my lord should have annoyed you. Oh! he is as proud as
Lucifer when he goes to open his parliament! It is such men, my dear,
that make me abhor this horrible England."

‘Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,’ returned Sikes. ‘There
never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your
father, and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by
this time, unless you came straight from the old ‘un without any
father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn’t wonder at, a bit.’

‘Why, your father has got some nonsense in his head that he’s the son of
a poor gentleman that died the other day,’ said Mrs. Squeers.

‘Do you mean,’ returned the little creature, with a flush suffusing her
face, ‘bad for your backs and your legs?’

Now. Is there any other witness? No other witness.

TO THE GENTLEMEN OF ENGLAND,
                      (BEING BACHELORS OR WIDOWERS,)

‘He’s going, John, I think!’

‘There, there, there!’ returned Mrs Boffin. ‘Come, come! Say no more of
it, Betty. It was a mistake, a mistake. Any one of us might have made it
in your place, and felt just as you do.’

“Is it so?” returned Carker. “Do you know better than anyone, that you
have no need to ask?”

“That,” said Mr. Guppy, “makes matters easier. Sir, I have come out
of my articles at Kenge and Carboy’s, and I believe with satisfaction
to all parties. I am now admitted (after undergoing an examination
that’s enough to badger a man blue, touching a pack of nonsense that
he don’t want to know) on the roll of attorneys and have taken out my
certificate, if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it.”

“I think I am, sir. At least I know I should be, if you were better
acquainted with my character.”

‘Well! I could have believed a great deal of you,’ returned the young
lady with burning indignation, ‘but I don’t think even I could have
believed this, of even you!’

They expected me home before Christmas; but had no idea of my returning
so soon. I had purposely misled them, that I might have the pleasure of
taking them by surprise. And yet, I was perverse enough to feel a chill
and disappointment in receiving no welcome, and rattling, alone and
silent, through the misty streets.

‘It certainly does,’ said Gashford, opening his eyes to their utmost
width; ‘really this is the most remarkable circumstance I have ever
known. How did you come by this piece of paper, my good friend?’

1861.

“In books, or work, or healthful play”

"I little thought," said the Englishman, after walking for several
minutes, and more than once blowing his nose, "when I was looking round
that cemetery--I'll go there!"

"Who hears in us, the Chimes, one note bespeaking disregard, or stern
regard, of any hope, or joy, or pain, or sorrow, of the many-sorrowed
throng; who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human
passions and affections, as it gauges the amount of miserable food on
which humanity may pine and wither; does us wrong. That wrong you have
done us!" said the Bell.

‘It IS unusual, sir,’ said Mrs Gamp. ‘But only for a day or two at most.
The gent,’ she whispered, ‘as I spoke about.’

‘Take care,’ said the old man with sparkling eyes, ‘that she does not
forget you when you would have her memory keenest. Take care that the
day don’t come when you walk barefoot in the streets, and she rides by
in a gay carriage of her own.’

‘At all events, they work,’ said Mr Boffin.

When the church-party return to lunch, grandpapa produces a small sprig
of mistletoe from his pocket, and tempts the boys to kiss their little
cousins under it—a proceeding which affords both the boys and the old
gentleman unlimited satisfaction, but which rather outrages
grandmamma’s ideas of decorum, until grandpapa says, that when he was
just thirteen years and three months old, _he_ kissed grandmamma under
a mistletoe too, on which the children clap their hands, and laugh very
heartily, as do aunt George and uncle George; and grandmamma looks
pleased, and says, with a benevolent smile, that grandpapa was an
impudent young dog, on which the children laugh very heartily again,
and grandpapa more heartily than any of them.

She had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when Mr.
Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above.  Mrs. Sparsit was
in good spirits, and inclined to be conversational.

Mr Pancks courageously nodded his head and said, ‘All right, ma’am.’ But
the effect of this mysterious communication upon Clennam was absolutely
to frighten him. And another circumstance invested this old lady with
peculiar terrors. Though she was always staring, she never acknowledged
that she saw any individual. The polite and attentive stranger would
desire, say, to consult her inclinations on the subject of potatoes. His
expressive action would be hopelessly lost upon her, and what could he
do? No man could say, ‘Mr F.’s Aunt, will you permit me?’ Every man
retired from the spoon, as Clennam did, cowed and baffled.

Nine o’clock struck, and the company arrived in shoals. Mr. Samuel
Briggs, Mrs. Briggs, and the Misses Briggs, made their appearance in a
smart private wherry. The three guitars, in their respective dark green
cases, were carefully stowed away in the bottom of the boat,
accompanied by two immense portfolios of music, which it would take at
least a week’s incessant playing to get through. The Tauntons arrived
at the same moment with more music, and a lion—a gentleman with a bass
voice and an incipient red moustache. The colours of the Taunton party
were pink; those of the Briggses a light blue. The Tauntons had
artificial flowers in their bonnets; here the Briggses gained a decided
advantage—they wore feathers.

Their abode, though poor and miserable, was not so utterly wretched as
in the days when only Good Mrs Brown inhabited it. Some few attempts at
cleanliness and order were manifest, though made in a reckless, gipsy
way, that might have connected them, at a glance, with the younger
woman. The shades of evening thickened and deepened as the two kept
silence, until the blackened walls were nearly lost in the prevailing
gloom.

BY JOYCE JOCUND.

‘She DOES toss her head,’ observed Miss Squeers, with an air of
abstraction.

MY DEAR MACREADY,

"Wery hearty, thankee, sir," replied the widower; "hope I see _you_
well, sir."

The old woman having now satisfied herself, by ocular
demonstration, that her English guest, even if he was the devil,
had neither horn, hoof, nor tail, that he could bear the sign of
the cross without changing his form, and that, when he spoke, not a
puff of sulphur came out of his mouth, began to take courage, and
at length commenced her story, which, weary and comfortless as
Stanton was, . . . .

‘The Triumphs of the Faith are not above ground in our splendid
churches,’ said the friar, looking round upon us, as we stopped to rest
in one of the low passages, with bones and dust surrounding us on every
side.  ‘They are here!  Among the Martyrs’ Graves!’  He was a gentle,
earnest man, and said it from his heart; but when I thought how Christian
men have dealt with one another; how, perverting our most merciful
religion, they have hunted down and tortured, burnt and beheaded,
strangled, slaughtered, and oppressed each other; I pictured to myself an
agony surpassing any that this Dust had suffered with the breath of life
yet lingering in it, and how these great and constant hearts would have
been shaken—how they would have quailed and drooped—if a foreknowledge of
the deeds that professing Christians would commit in the Great Name for
which they died, could have rent them with its own unutterable anguish,
on the cruel wheel, and bitter cross, and in the fearful fire.

Clennam said that he could easily believe it.

“Be so good as to explain what you mean by those very unjustifiable
expressions.”

"I've put my name down for an arm, at our place," said Mr. Allen.
"We're clubbing for a subject, and the list is nearly full, only we
can't get hold of any fellow that wants a head. I wish you'd take it."

‘You will be hipped, Haredale; you will be miserable, melancholy,
utterly wretched,’ returned the other. ‘It’s a place of the very last
description for a man of your temper. I know it will make you very
miserable.’

FROM

It was not precisely the kind of weather in which people usually take
tea in summer-houses, far less in summer-houses in an advanced state of
decay, and overlooking the slimy banks of a great river at low water.
Nevertheless, it was in this choice retreat that Mr Quilp ordered a
cold collation to be prepared, and it was beneath its cracked and leaky
roof that he, in due course of time, received Mr Sampson and his sister
Sally.

By what visionary hands she was led along upon that journey of escape
from the Samaritan; by what voices, hushed in the grave, she seemed
to be addressed; how she fancied the dead child in her arms again, and
times innumerable adjusted her shawl to keep it warm; what infinite
variety of forms of tower and roof and steeple the trees took; how many
furious horsemen rode at her, crying, ‘There she goes! Stop! Stop,
Betty Higden!’ and melted away as they came close; be these things left
untold. Faring on and hiding, hiding and faring on, the poor harmless
creature, as though she were a Murderess and the whole country were up
after her, wore out the day, and gained the night.

I send you a Manchester paper, as you desire. The report is not exactly
done, but very well done, notwithstanding. It was a very splendid sight,
I assure you, and an awful-looking audience. I am going to preside at a
similar meeting at Liverpool on the 26th of next month, and on my way
home I may be obliged to preside at another at Birmingham. I will send
you papers, if the reports be at all like the real thing.

Mr Swiveller gathered up his knees so as to make a great cone of the
bedclothes, and conveyed into his countenance an expression of the
utmost concern.  But the small servant pausing, and holding up her
finger, the cone gently disappeared, though the look of concern did not.

With that piece of comfort, very ruefully uttered, he went, in anything
but a jolly manner, to bed.

“Isn’t it natural that I should dwell on this, when I am all affection
and sensitiveness, and am wounded in the cruellest way, whenever you
look at me?”

"Certainly," said Grimaldi, looking over the bill. "You had better ring
for the waiter: I have no doubt he can explain the matter."

The appearance, and still more, the disappearance of the crone,
had however made an impression; every step he took he became more
thoughtful. "'Twould be deuced provoking though, if he _should_ break my
neck after all!" He turned, and gazed at Dolphin with the scrutinizing
eye of a veterinary surgeon.--"I'll be shot if he is not groggy!" said
the Baron.

Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.
The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all
eyes, ears, and spikes.

“No, sir,” returned the trooper, lifting up his eyes and coming out
of his reverie. “I can’t say anything about him. He will be worn out
soon, I expect. You may file a strong man’s heart away for a good
many years, but it will tell all of a sudden at last.”

|No sooner, however, was one source of dread removed, than another was
aroused. His hoards might be gone! Terrified by this idea, he flew to
all his hiding-places, and placed their contents on the table. His dim
eyes sparkled with unnatural brilliancy as he gloated over them.

“No, nothing else, except an old birdcage (I wonder how that ever came
there!) and a coal-scuttle.”

"Inflammable," mildly suggested Mr. Pickwick, who thought something
worse was coming.

Again a few years are passed. It is winter, with a roaring wind and a
thick gray fog. The graves in the Church-yard are covered with snow, and
there are great icicles in the Church-porch. The wind now carries a
swathe of snow along the tops of the graves, as though the “sheeted
dead” were at some melancholy play; and hark! the icicles fall with a
crash and jingle, like a solemn mockery of the echo of the unseemly
mirth of one who is now coming to his final rest.

"No, my dear boy," says the Major.  "Everything we have is hers, and we
are hers."

They were very wrathful with him (for he had wounded two men), and
even called out to those in front, to bring him forth and hang him on
a lamp-post. But Gabriel was quite undaunted, and looked from Hugh and
Dennis, who held him by either arm, to Simon Tappertit, who confronted
him.

Mr. Grummer’s mode of proceeding was professional, but peculiar. His
first act was to bolt the door on the inside; his second, to polish his
head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief; his
third, to place his hat, with the cotton handkerchief in it, on the
nearest chair; and his fourth, to produce from the breast-pocket of his
coat a short truncheon, surmounted by a brazen crown, with which he
beckoned to Mr. Pickwick with a grave and ghost-like air.

“Your appetite’s been touched like by your accident,” said the
landlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. “Try a tenderer
bit.”

"You little Conjurer" I says, "how did you ever make it all out?  Go in
and write it every word down, for it's a wonder."

As it is better that every kind of work honestly undertaken and
discharged, should speak for itself than be spoken for, I will only
remark further on one intended omission in the New Series.  The Extra
Christmas Number has now been so extensively, and regularly, and often
imitated, that it is in very great danger of becoming tiresome.  I have
therefore resolved (though I cannot add, willingly) to abolish it, at the
highest tide of its success.

Serjeant Buzfuz began by saying, that never, in the whole course of
his professional experience--never, from the very first moment of
his applying himself to the study and practice of the law--had he
approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion, or with such a
heavy sense of the responsibility imposed upon him--a responsibility,
he would say, which he could never have supported, were he not buoyed
up and sustained by a conviction so strong, that it amounted to
positive certainty that the cause of truth and justice, or, in other
words, the cause of his much-injured and most oppressed client, must
prevail with the high-minded and intelligent dozen of men whom he now
saw in that box before him.

‘Well, Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, with considerable pain depicted in his
countenance, ‘you will permit me to assure you that I am a most
unfortunate man, so far as this case is concerned.’

Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
too.

‘Where’s your security, Mr. Clip?’

‘My dear Mrs Finching, you were not to blame, and I never blamed you.
We were both too young, too dependent and helpless, to do anything but
accept our separation.--Pray think how long ago,’ gently remonstrated
Arthur.

Hereupon the stout father, being rather mystified, and the stout mother
rather distracted by maternal anxiety, the whole party deposit
themselves in the Margate boat, and after having congratulated himself
on having secured very comfortable seats, the stout father sallies to
the chimney to look for his luggage, which he has a faint recollection
of having given some man, something, to take somewhere. No luggage,
however, bearing the most remote resemblance to his own, in shape or
form, is to be discovered; on which the stout father calls very loudly
for an officer, to whom he states the case, in the presence of another
father of another family—a little thin man—who entirely concurs with
him (the stout father) in thinking that it’s high time something was
done with these steam companies, and that as the Corporation Bill
failed to do it, something else must; for really people’s property is
not to be sacrificed in this way; and that if the luggage isn’t
restored without delay, he will take care it shall be put in the
papers, for the public is not to be the victim of these great
monopolies. To this, the officer, in his turn, replies, that that
company, ever since it has been St. Kat’rine’s Dock Company, has
protected life and property; that if it had been the London Bridge
Wharf Company, indeed, he shouldn’t have wondered, seeing that the
morality of that company (they being the opposition) can’t be answered
for, by no one; but as it is, he’s convinced there must be some
mistake, and he wouldn’t mind making a solemn oath afore a magistrate
that the gentleman’ll find his luggage afore he gets to Margate.

At the entrance, Lady Brabazon and her daughter were joined by Beau
Villiers, Sir Bulkeley Price, and Firebras, Sir Singleton Spinke having
disappeared. Randulph had already been more than once at Ranelagh, but
it was only to attend the ordinary concerts, and never having seen a
masquerade, he was extraordinarily struck with the spectacle presented
to him.

‘I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.  I
should like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me.  Is this your
wife?’

He answered in a low voice: “Don’t you know it is?”

‘What sort of a night, nurse?’

Regardless of Bella’s dissuasions he ran out, and quickly returned with
the new supply. ‘My dear child,’ he said, as he spread it on another
piece of paper before her, ‘the idea of a splendid—!’ and then looked
at her figure, and stopped short.

‘Oh! nothing has an interest to me that’s not a secret,’ replied
Nadgett, as he tied the string about his pocket-book, and put it up. ‘It
always takes away any pleasure I may have had in this inquiry even to
make it known to you.’

Ham nodded to me several times, as if he would have said so too.

‘Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching
Hell-babe,’ cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging
the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. ‘That door.
Quick!’ He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. ‘Is the
downstairs door fast?’

"Now, then!" said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head
in at the door, "what do you want, young man?"

“Then I’ll just tak’ my depairture,” replies the other, “for I’m nae
gude here!” With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and
returns to finish his dinner.

“I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,
and (as far as I could see) face too.

“My dear,” says Mr. Snagsby when his tongue is loosened, “will you
take anything? A little—not to put too fine a point upon it—drop of
shrub?”

Hast thou gone sadly through a dreary night,
And found no light,
No guide, no star, to cheer thee through the plain--
No friend, save pain?
Wait, and thy soul shall see, when most forlorn,
Rise a new morn.

"'Gratifying, Cobbs?' says Master Harry. 'It's better than a million of
the brightest diamonds, to be liked by Norah. You're going away ain't
you, Cobbs? Then you shall be our head gardener when we're married.' And
he tucks her, in her little sky-blue mantle, under his arm, and walks
away.

‘Oh!’ said Riderhood, very deliberately spitting out the grass he had
been chewing. ‘Then, I make out, T’otherest, as he is a-going to her?’

"How old is that horse, my friend?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his
nose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare.

"I ain't partickler in weather," returned the Tinker, with a yawn.

A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. ‘Who’s there?’ he
cried in a shrill tone.

FULLER'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, _Monday, March 14th, 1842._

"Caroline," said he, as during a morning call, which had been prolonged
to a most unfashionable extent, he sate alone by her side, "I find you
the same kind being that you always were; it is from that tenderness of
feeling, which under happier circumstances would have given additional
value to your character, that I now dread an inroad on your peace. You
confess that you are wearied with the cold and monotonous routine of
your daily life, and that it is your fate to be linked with one who is
incapable of understanding or returning any deep emotion of the heart;
can you then wonder that I should tremble for your peace, when I see
you flattered by the attentions of a man from whom I am afraid you
have not been sufficiently discreet to conceal the disquiet which you
suffer?"

"I believe you, my pet," replied Miss Mowcher. "I keep his nails in
order for him. Twice a week! Fingers _and_ toes!"

I assure you I am very truly and unaffectedly sensible of your earnest
friendliness, and in proof of my feeling its worth I shall
unhesitatingly trouble you sometimes, in the fullest reliance on your
meaning what you say. The letter from Nelson Square is a very manly and
touching one. But I am more helpless in such a case as that than in any
other, having really fewer means of helping such a gentleman to
employment than I have of firing off the guns in the Tower. Such,
appeals come to me here in scores upon scores.

It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on
that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the
chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at
the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had
perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the
night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in
the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man
who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
the country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the
night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came
upstairs.

I soon found, however, that all the men on board who had known Wylie,
from Warrick down, vied with each other in treating her with a sort of
patronizing respect; even Jake, the black cook, was continually sending
up little messes for her and Joe. She was but a poor mouse of a woman,
who had made a god of that stupid little weak-eyed fellow, and of his
boy after he was gone; take her on politics, or even gossip, anything
outside of Wylie and her child, and there was nothing in her. Warrick
told me that she had never been outside of Cairo before, and the near
village of Blandville, where she had been a sempstress before her
marriage; this journey was like a glimpse of a new world to her. I used
to see her sitting in a dark corner on deck until late in the night, her
eyes strained over the long stretch of shore as we floated by; and I
could understand how the heavy, wooded hills, crouching like sullen
beasts along the water’s edge, or the miles and miles of yellow
cane-brake lying flat and barren in the desolate, homesick twilight of a
winter’s day, might have a different meaning to the lonely woman, and to
us, who counted them only as “a run” of so many hours.

‘My angel,’ said Rigaud, ‘I have said what I will take, and time
presses. Before coming here, I placed copies of the most important of
these papers in another hand. Put off the time till the Marshalsea gate
shall be shut for the night, and it will be too late to treat. The
prisoner will have read them.’

Now that we three were left to entertain ourselves with conversation,
Mr. Mincin’s extreme friendliness became every moment more apparent; he
was so amazingly friendly, indeed, that it was impossible to talk about
anything in which he had not the chief concern. We happened to allude
to some affairs in which our friend and we had been mutually engaged
nearly fourteen years before, when Mr. Mincin was all at once reminded
of a joke which our friend had made on that day four years, which he
positively must insist upon telling—and which he did tell accordingly,
with many pleasant recollections of what he said, and what Mrs. Capper
said, and how he well remembered that they had been to the play with
orders on the very night previous, and had seen Romeo and Juliet, and
the pantomime, and how Mrs. Capper being faint had been led into the
lobby, where she smiled, said it was nothing after all, and went back
again, with many other interesting and absorbing particulars: after
which the friendly young gentleman went on to assure us, that our
friend had experienced a marvellously prophetic opinion of that same
pantomime, which was of such an admirable kind, that two morning papers
took the same view next day: to this our friend replied, with a little
triumph, that in that instance he had some reason to think he had been
correct, which gave the friendly young gentleman occasion to believe
that our friend was always correct; and so we went on, until our
friend, filling a bumper, said he must drink one glass to his dear
friend Mincin, than whom he would say no man saved the lives of his
acquaintances more, or had a more friendly heart. Finally, our friend
having emptied his glass, said, ‘God bless you, Mincin,’—and Mr. Mincin
and he shook hands across the table with much affection and
earnestness.

“Without saying more?” cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very
suppression, seemed only the more furious. “It’s a lie! I’ll not be
played with. She said more—I’ll tear the life out of you both, but
I’ll know what it was.”

She was glad to try to do anything for me, and was going. I stopped
her at the door, and said, "Now, if you are deceiving me, you may
perhaps have my senses to answer for."

When we arrived at the _Three Pies_, the sign of the house where the
club was held, Timmins went up stairs to communicate the fact of my
being below, and to assure the company that all was regular and right,
as he said; and shortly afterwards I was ushered into the presence,
and introduced to the worthies previously named. The president, a
jolly-looking man about fifty, sat in an elevated chair at the top of
a long table, which gave a goodly display of pipes, glasses of grog,
&c. On each side, the members sat at their most perfect ease, smoking
and chatting. It would appear that they had been at business some time,
for it seemed ebb-tide with the contents of the glasses; and several
worthies were in the act of knocking the ashes out of their respective
pipes. After ordering a glass of punch and a segar, and another for
Timmins, a conversation which was going on before we came in was
resumed, of which the following is a faithful report.

Price                                       $3.75

As these people passed him standing still in the court-yard, and one of
them turned back to inquire if he could assist him with his services,
it came into Arthur Clennam’s mind that he would speak to Little Dorrit
again before he went away. She would have recovered her first surprise,
and might feel easier with him. He asked this member of the fraternity
(who had two red herrings in his hand, and a loaf and a blacking brush
under his arm), where was the nearest place to get a cup of coffee
at. The nondescript replied in encouraging terms, and brought him to a
coffee-shop in the street within a stone’s throw.

“Gabriel paused in some alarm, in the act of raising the wicker bottle
to his lips, and looked round. The bottom of the oldest grave about him,
was not more still and quiet, than the church-yard in the pale
moonlight. The cold hoar frost glistened on the tombstones, and sparkled
like rows of gems among the stone carvings of the old church. The snow
lay hard and crisp upon the ground, and spread over the thickly-strewn
mounds of earth, so white and smooth a cover, that it seemed as if
corpses lay there, hidden only by their winding sheets. Not the faintest
rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene. Sound itself
appeared to be frozen up, all was so cold and still.

The child, sobbing, clasped her round the neck, saying, "O Meg, O dear
Meg!"

In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and
did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.

Attached to our Assembly Rooms is a library.  There is a wheel of fortune
in it, but it is rusty and dusty, and never turns.  A large doll, with
moveable eyes, was put up to be raffled for, by five-and-twenty members
at two shillings, seven years ago this autumn, and the list is not full
yet.  We are rather sanguine, now, that the raffle will come off next
year.  We think so, because we only want nine members, and should only
want eight, but for number two having grown up since her name was
entered, and withdrawn it when she was married.  Down the street, there
is a toy-ship of considerable burden, in the same condition.  Two of the
boys who were entered for that raffle have gone to India in real ships,
since; and one was shot, and died in the arms of his sister’s lover, by
whom he sent his last words home.

Mr. Datchery looks again, to convince himself. Yes, again! As ugly and
withered as one of the fantastic carvings on the under brackets of the
stall seats, as malignant as the Evil One, as hard as the big brass
eagle holding the sacred books upon his wings (and, according to the
sculptor’s representation of his ferocious attributes, not at all
converted by them), she hugs herself in her lean arms, and then shakes
both fists at the leader of the Choir.

When the Major explained our words to the military character, that
gentleman shrugged his shoulders and showed the Major the card on which
it was written about the Legacy for me.  It had been written with a weak
and trembling hand in bed, and I knew no more of the writing than of the
face.  Neither did the Major.

‘Your suspicion, Mrs Lupin,’ he repeated, ‘is very natural, and I have
no doubt correct. I will wait upon these travellers.’

‘He is better now,’ replied the miser, uncovering his face; ‘the fit
is past; but it was sharp while it lasted. Randulph Crew,’ he added
faintly, and stretching out his thin hand to him, ‘I am glad to see you.
Years ago, I knew your father well. But unhappy circumstances separated
us, and since then I have seen nothing of him. I fancied him alive, and
well, and happy, and your sudden announcement of his death gave me a
great shock. Your father was a good man, Randulph--a good man, and a
kind one.’

In an upper room of one of these houses—a detached house of fair size,
ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of
which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already
described—there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other
every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation,
sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence. One of these was Toby
Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years,
whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose
face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same
occasion. This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags.

“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.

It was a great point with Mr Mould, and a part of his professional
tact, not to seem to know the doctor; though in reality they were near
neighbours, and very often, as in the present instance, worked together.
So he advanced to fit on his black kid gloves as if he had never seen
him in all his life; while the doctor, on his part, looked as distant
and unconscious as if he had heard and read of undertakers, and had
passed their shops, but had never before been brought into communication
with one.

‘May I ask how old she is?’ inquired Nicholas.

THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW
LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER

“Aye!” says Allan. “Why, what had you been doing?”

‘You did!’ screamed the miser. ‘And why did you not tell me this before?
I might have caught them--might have got back the spoil.’

Time went on, and the turnkey began to fail. His chest swelled, and his
legs got weak, and he was short of breath. The well-worn wooden stool
was ‘beyond him,’ he complained. He sat in an arm-chair with a cushion,
and sometimes wheezed so, for minutes together, that he couldn’t turn
the key. When he was overpowered by these fits, the debtor often turned
it for him.

‘Pray,’ said Kate, in great confusion, while these preliminaries were
in course of completion. ‘Pray do not make me the subject of any bets.
Uncle, I cannot really--’

When Charles, lonely for the loss of Miss Lane, was safe at Trent, a
ship was hired at Lyme, the master of which engaged to take two
gentlemen to France. In the evening of the same day, the King—now
riding as servant before another young lady—set off for a public-house
at a place called Charmouth, where the captain of the vessel was to
take him on board. But, the captain’s wife, being afraid of her husband
getting into trouble, locked him up and would not let him sail. Then
they went away to Bridport; and, coming to the inn there, found the
stable-yard full of soldiers who were on the look-out for Charles, and
who talked about him while they drank. He had such presence of mind,
that he led the horses of his party through the yard as any other
servant might have done, and said, ‘Come out of the way, you soldiers;
let us have room to pass here!’ As he went along, he met a half-tipsy
ostler, who rubbed his eyes and said to him, ‘Why, I was formerly
servant to Mr. Potter at Exeter, and surely I have sometimes seen you
there, young man?’ He certainly had, for Charles had lodged there. His
ready answer was, ‘Ah, I did live with him once; but I have no time to
talk now. We’ll have a pot of beer together when I come back.’

‘Drat that beadle!’ said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking
at the garden-gate. ‘If it isn’t him at this time in the morning!
Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it _is_
a pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.’

"How long is it since it happened?"

CHAPTER 7. MY ‘FIRST HALF’ AT SALEM HOUSE

Without waiting for any reply he took Nell in his arms, and bade the old
man follow.

‘It is, is it, sir?’ asked the matron.

"You're under arrest," he shouted, through the keyhole.

"It stands to reason, not," argued Jack Sheavehole, "or, what's the
use of a fellow having the stuff sarved out at all? Short allowance
only brings a mist afore the eyes and circumpollygates the head till
everything looms, like Beachy in a fog. But when you've your full
whack, it clears the daylights, cherishes the cockles o' your heart,
and makes you more handy, 'cause you often sees two first leftenants
where there's ounly one."

"Dear me," cried Fogg, "how do you do, Mr. Pickwick? I hope you are
well, sir. I thought I knew the face," said Fogg, drawing up a chair
and looking round him with a smile.

As he sat pondering, and mechanically weighing his money in his palm,
the deep breathing of the traveller in the other bed fell so regularly
upon his hearing that it attracted his eyes in that direction. The man
was covered up warm, and had drawn the white curtain at his head, so
that he could be only heard, not seen. But the deep regular breathing,
still going on while the other was taking off his worn shoes and
gaiters, and still continuing when he had laid aside his coat and
cravat, became at length a strong provocative to curiosity, and
incentive to get a glimpse of the sleeper’s face.

“My lad,” said the Captain, “you must tell the young woman honestly
that this here fatal news is too correct. They don’t romance, you see,
on such pints. It’s entered on the ship’s log, and that’s the truest
book as a man can write. To-morrow morning,” said the Captain, “I’ll
step out and make inquiries; but they’ll lead to no good. They can’t do
it. If you’ll give me a look-in in the forenoon, you shall know what I
have heerd; but tell the young woman from Cap’en Cuttle, that it’s
over. Over!” And the Captain, hooking off his glazed hat, pulled his
handkerchief out of the crown, wiped his grizzled head despairingly,
and tossed the handkerchief in again, with the indifference of deep
dejection.

‘Some gentlefolks who are fond of ancient days, and what belongs to
them,’ he said, ‘like to buy these keepsakes from our church and ruins.
Sometimes, I make them of scraps of oak, that turn up here and there;
sometimes of bits of coffins which the vaults have long preserved.  See
here--this is a little chest of the last kind, clasped at the edges
with fragments of brass plates that had writing on ‘em once, though it
would be hard to read it now.  I haven’t many by me at this time of
year, but these shelves will be full--next summer.’

I felt, but I am sure I don’t know why, that this was self-denying
and devoted in Mrs. Micawber, and I uttered a murmur to that effect.
Traddles, who took his tone from me, did likewise, still looking at the
fire.

My pretty Dora! When she came down to dinner on the ensuing Sunday, and
was so glad to see old Traddles (who always dined with us on Sunday), we
thought she would be "running about as she used to do," in a few days.
But they said, wait a few days more; and then, wait a few days more; and
still she neither ran nor walked. She looked very pretty, and was very
merry; but the little feet that used to be so nimble when they danced
round Jip, were dull and motionless.

‘Yes, sir,’ replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.

‘Upon my word. Now, isn’t that curious?’

“Certainly and surely I do, guv’ner,” is Phil’s reply.

"Set by, Injun. So the boys is goin' ter kinder cellybrate ter-morrer,
be they?"

“Take some water, Johnson—dishes, Sir,” said Mr Feeder.

The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,
painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break
the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver
appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to
the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately
admitted into the lodge.

Coming home here last night, from a day's business in London, I found
your most excellent note awaiting me, in which I have had a pleasure to
be derived from none but good and natural things. I can now honestly
assure you that I believe you will write _well_, and that I have a
lively hope that I may be the means of showing you yourself in print one
day. Your powers of graceful and light-hearted observation need nothing
but the little touches on which we are both agreed. And I am perfectly
sure that they will be as pleasant to you as to anyone, for nobody can
see so well as you do, without feeling kindly too.

“As to collecting newspapers and books, my dear,” said Lamps, “it’s clear
I can have no merit in that, because they’re not my perquisites.  You
see, sir, it’s this way: A Guard, he’ll say to me, ‘Hallo, here you are,
Lamps.  I’ve saved this paper for your daughter.  How is she agoing on?’
A Head-Porter, he’ll say to me, ‘Here!  Catch hold, Lamps.  Here’s a
couple of wollumes for your daughter.  Is she pretty much where she
were?’  And that’s what makes it double welcome, you see.  If she had a
thousand pound in a box, they wouldn’t trouble themselves about her; but
being what she is—that is, you understand,” Lamps added, somewhat
hurriedly, “not having a thousand pound in a box—they take thought for
her.  And as concerning the young pairs, married and unmarried, it’s only
natural I should bring home what little I can about _them_, seeing that
there’s not a Couple of either sort in the neighbourhood that don’t come
of their own accord to confide in Phœbe.”

CHAPTER 40. — THE WANDERER

‘No, no,’ said Nicholas, detaining him. ‘I would rather not. I--at
least--pshaw! why cannot I speak out? Here; you see that I am travelling
in a very humble manner, and have made my way hither on foot. It is more
than probable, I think, that the gentleman may not relish my company;
and although I am the dusty figure you see, I am too proud to thrust
myself into his.’

‘Why, then,’ said Mrs Lammle, charmed by the discovery which flowed from
the premises, ‘you neither of you know it! How charming!’

Stephen made a bow.  Not a servile one—these Hands will never do that!
Lord bless you, sir, you’ll never catch them at that, if they have been
with you twenty years!—and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit,
tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.

Florence asked him what he thought he heard.

“And you come here from her?” said the Captain.

Think of his name, The Conqueror, and then consider how he lay in
death! The moment he was dead, his physicians, priests, and nobles, not
knowing what contest for the throne might now take place, or what might
happen in it, hastened away, each man for himself and his own property;
the mercenary servants of the court began to rob and plunder; the body
of the King, in the indecent strife, was rolled from the bed, and lay
alone, for hours, upon the ground. O Conqueror, of whom so many great
names are proud now, of whom so many great names thought nothing then,
it were better to have conquered one true heart, than England!

I perceived, you understand, that he was soured by his misfortunes, and I
felt for Mr. Chops.

A sunbeam of placid benevolence played on Mr. Pickwick's features as he
said, "I have half made up my mind to engage you myself."

“You are so changed,” said Walter—

[Illustration: With a look of scorn she put into my hand a bit of paper.
                                                              _Page 12_]

‘Now, Clara,’ says Mr. Murdstone, ‘be firm with the boy. Don’t say, “Oh,
Davy, Davy!” That’s childish. He knows his lesson, or he does not know
it.’

Mr. Micawber was so deeply affected by this proof of her devotion (as to
me, I was dissolved in tears), that he hung over her in a passionate
manner, imploring her to look up, and to be calm. But the more he asked
Mrs. Micawber to look up, the more she fixed her eyes on nothing; and
the more he asked her to compose herself, the more she wouldn't.
Consequently Mr. Micawber was soon so overcome, that he mingled his
tears with hers and mine; until he begged me to do him the favor of
taking a chair on the staircase, while he got her into bed. I would have
taken my leave for the night, but he would not hear of my doing that
until the strangers' bell should ring. So I sat at the staircase window,
until he came out with another chair and joined me.

‘Hurrah!’ echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off his hat and dashing it on the
floor, and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the
kitchen. At this humorous feat he laughed outright.

“I never told him so, sir,” returned Oliver in amazement.

‘Oliver, my child,’ said Mrs. Maylie, ‘where have you been, and why
do you look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this
moment. What is the matter?’

“Did I see among them, the intelligence and refinement: the true,
    honest, patriotic heart of America?  Here and there, were drops of
    its blood and life, but they scarcely coloured the stream of
    desperate adventurers which sets that way for profit and for pay.  It
    is the game of these men, and of their profligate organs, to make the
    strife of politics so fierce and brutal, and so destructive of all
    self-respect in worthy men, that sensitive and delicate-minded
    persons shall be kept aloof, and they, and such as they, be left to
    battle out their selfish views unchecked.  And thus this lowest of
    all scrambling fights goes on, and they who in other countries would,
    from their intelligence and station, most aspire to make the laws, do
    here recoil the farthest from that degradation.

‘Oh!’ says Mr Wegg, with a sort of sense of being introduced; ‘I
dare say you were all right enough in your own country, but I hope no
objections will be taken to my saying that the Frenchman was never yet
born as I should wish to match.’

It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened
the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and
walked, distractedly, into the street.

‘Nor a rich lady?’

When there was a rehearsal at Sadler's Wells, his mother, who was
engaged there as well as himself, was in the habit of remaining at the
theatre all day, taking her meals in her dressing-room, and occupying
herself with needlework. This she had done to avoid the long walk
in the middle of the day from Sadler's Wells to Great Wild-street,
and back again almost directly. It became a habit; and when they had
removed to Penton-place, and consequently were so much nearer the
theatre that it was no longer necessary, it still continued. Mr.
Hughes, who had now become principal proprietor of the theatre, and
who lived in the house attached to it, had several children, the
eldest of whom was Miss Maria Hughes, a young lady of considerable
accomplishments, who had always been much attached to Grimaldi's
mother, and who embraced every opportunity of being in her society.
Knowing the hours at which she was in the dressing-room during the day,
Miss Hughes was in the habit of taking her work, and sitting with her
from three or four o'clock until six, when the other female performers
beginning to arrive, she retired. Grimaldi was generally at the theatre
between four and five, always taking tea with his mother at the
last-named hour, and sitting with her until the arrival of the ladies
broke up the little party. In this way an intimacy arose between Miss
Hughes and himself, which ultimately ripened into feelings of a warmer
nature.

On the very next day after the receipt of the letter, down came the tall
postilion in a post-chaise,—not upon one of the horses, but
inside—actually inside the chaise,—and, driving up to the very door of
the town-hall, where the corporation were assembled, delivered a letter,
written by the Lord knows who, and signed by Nicholas Tulrumble, in which
Nicholas said, all through four sides of closely-written, gilt-edged,
hot-pressed, Bath post letter paper, that he responded to the call of his
fellow-townsmen with feelings of heartfelt delight; that he accepted the
arduous office which their confidence had imposed upon him; that they
would never find him shrinking from the discharge of his duty; that he
would endeavour to execute his functions with all that dignity which
their magnitude and importance demanded; and a great deal more to the
same effect.  But even this was not all.  The tall postilion produced
from his right-hand top-boot, a damp copy of that afternoon’s number of
the county paper; and there, in large type, running the whole length of
the very first column, was a long address from Nicholas Tulrumble to the
inhabitants of Mudfog, in which he said that he cheerfully complied with
their requisition, and, in short, as if to prevent any mistake about the
matter, told them over again what a grand fellow he meant to be, in very
much the same terms as those in which he had already told them all about
the matter in his letter.

And thus ended the Young Advocate’s Wedding Day.

"The loanst of a breeches, plase your honour."

Mrs. Dickens, Miss Hogarth, and all the house send a thousand kind loves
and regards to Madame Regnier and the dear little boys. You will bring
them to London when you come, with all the force of the Français--will
you not?

laughter.

         Oh! it would be revenge indeed,

Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of
responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he
gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it
a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle’s.

‘I will, ma’am, with the greatest pleasure,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.

CHAPTER LVII

A handsome demon's dress, spangled and ornamented with gilt [guilt]
mask, and mace.

There was some surprise among the company, as you may imagine. Mrs.
Fielding, being a lady of infinite discernment, suggested that the cake
was poisoned, and related a narrative of a cake which, within her
knowledge, had turned a seminary for young ladies blue. But she was
overruled by acclamation; and the cake was cut by May with much ceremony
and rejoicing.

Well!  I tried to settle to my tea but I could not do it what with
thinking of Miss Wozenham and her distresses.  It was a wretched night
and I went up to a front window and looked over at Wozenham's and as well
as I could make it out down the street in the fog it was the dismallest
of the dismal and not a light to be seen.  So at last I save to myself
"This will not do," and I puts on my oldest bonnet and shawl not wishing
Miss Wozenham to be reminded of my best at such a time, and lo and behold
you I goes over to Wozenham's and knocks.  "Miss Wozenham at home?" I
says turning my head when I heard the door go.  And then I saw it was
Miss Wozenham herself who had opened it and sadly worn she was poor thing
and her eyes all swelled and swelled with crying.  "Miss Wozenham" I says
"it is several years since there was a little unpleasantness betwixt us
on the subject of my grandson's cap being down your Airy.  I have
overlooked it and I hope you have done the same."  "Yes Mrs. Lirriper"
she says in a surprise, "I have."  "Then my dear" I says "I should be
glad to come in and speak a word to you."  Upon my calling her my dear
Miss Wozenham breaks out a crying most pitiful, and a not unfeeling
elderly person that might have been better shaved in a nightcap with a
hat over it offering a polite apology for the mumps having worked
themselves into his constitution, and also for sending home to his wife
on the bellows which was in his hand as a writing-desk, looks out of the
back parlour and says "The lady wants a word of comfort" and goes in
again.  So I was able to say quite natural "Wants a word of comfort does
she sir?  Then please the pigs she shall have it!"  And Miss Wozenham and
me we go into the front room with a wretched light that seemed to have
been crying too and was sputtering out, and I says "Now my dear, tell me
all," and she wrings her hands and says "O Mrs. Lirriper that man is in
possession here, and I have not a friend in the world who is able to help
me with a shilling."

"God bless you, Pip, old chap!"

The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver's hair down over
his eyes, and said he'd know better by-and-by; upon which the old
gentleman, observing Oliver's colour mounting, changed the subject by
asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that
morning. This made him wonder more and more, for it was plain from
the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver
naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so
very industrious.

"It is my sight restored. It is my sight!" she cried. "I have been
blind, and now my eyes are open. I never knew him! To think I might have
died, and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to me!"

A dim Ideal of tender grace
In my soul reigned supreme;
Too noble and too sweet I thought
To live, save in a dream--
Within thy heart to-day it lies, and looks on me from thy dear eyes.

‘I’d go ten thousand mile,’ he said, ‘I’d go till I dropped dead, to lay
that money down afore him. If I do that, and find my Em’ly, I’m content.
If I doen’t find her, maybe she’ll come to hear, sometime, as her loving
uncle only ended his search for her when he ended his life; and if I
know her, even that will turn her home at last!’

‘So it is,’ said Squeers. ‘Ain’t it, Nickleby?’

But the next moment the exhilarating gush of young life shot through
their veins. They were now in the happy prime of youth. Age, with its
miserable train of cares, and sorrows, and diseases, was remembered
only as the trouble of a dream, from which they had joyously awoke.
The fresh gloss of the soul, so early lost, and without which the
world's successive scenes had been but a gallery of faded pictures,
again threw its enchantment over all their prospects. They felt like
new-created beings in a new-created universe.

[Illustration:

"Betsey Trotwood don't look a likely subject for the tender passion,"
said my aunt, composedly, "but the time was, Trot, when she believed in
that man most entirely. When she loved him, Trot, right well. When there
was no proof of attachment and affection that she would not have given
him. He repaid her by breaking her fortune, and nearly breaking her
heart. So she put all that sort of sentiment, once and for ever in a
grave, and filled it up, and flattened it down."

“I saw my ward oftener than she saw me,” he added, cheerily making
light of it, “and I always knew she was beloved, useful, and happy.
She repays me twenty-thousandfold, and twenty more to that, every
hour in every day!”

‘Don’t let me put you out of the way,’ said a voice Miss La Creevy knew.
‘I told the servant not to mention my name, because I wished to surprise
you.’

"Father," said the Blind Girl, drawing close to his side, and stealing
one arm round his neck, "tell me something about May. She is very fair?"

It was a slow, prospective kind of consolation; but the cheerfulness
and good nature with which it was administered, gave it a value it did
not intrinsically possess. After a moment’s silence, Polly asked, in a
more sprightly manner:

‘Oh! I’m all right,’ replied the smoker. ‘I shall be bailed out
to-morrow.’

‘Well!  I don’t object; but, still I’m not quite sure that—’

At a nimbler trot, as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated him by
reviving old associations, Mr Boffin ascended the ‘serpentining walk’,
up the Mound which he had described to Silas Wegg on the occasion of
their beginning to decline and fall. On striking into it he turned his
lantern off. The two followed him, stooping low, so that their figures
might make no mark in relief against the sky when he should turn his
lantern on again. Mr Venus took the lead, towing Mr Wegg, in order that
his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it
should dig for itself. They could just make out that the Golden Dustman
stopped to breathe. Of course they stopped too, instantly.

A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.
Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of
humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse
was young. They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother—a
mother once—among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and
the birds sang on.

“Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.”

Fading Away

He pointed to a heavy oaken door, thickly studded with nails, at the
lower end of the room.  Approaching the door, with the portfolio,
Obenreizer discovered, to his astonishment, that there were no means
whatever of opening it from the outside.  There was no handle, no bolt,
no key, and (climax of passive obstruction!) no keyhole.

"Some people hold dancing to be below the dignity of a regular theatre;
but I can by no means subscribe to their opinion, since one of the
principal ends of every theatre, is to delight; and everything that can
contribute to that purpose, under proper restrictions, has an undoubted
right to a place there. I shall not affect to show my learning, by
adding, the ancients not only admitted dancing, but thought it a
necessary ornament in the performance of the most celebrated tragedies.

Mr. Samuel Pickwick.

“Come in, come in,” said the old lady: “I knew we should hear of him.
Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I
said so all along.”

Ayesha silently drew her black veil over her face, and turned, with
the being she loved, from the terror he scorned, to share in the
hope that he cherished.

“You don’t mean to deny that, I suppose?” said the doctor, laying
Oliver gently down again.

“The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which
was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and
there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to
pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial
and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in
this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity, as I saw them all that night.

Mr. Dick considered, hesitated, brightened, and rejoined, "Have him
measured for a suit of clothes directly."

The Doctor paused.  Mr. Goodchild, who had been following every word that
fell from his lips up to this time, leaned forward eagerly to ask a
question.  Before he could say a word, the latch of the door was raised,
without any warning sound of footsteps in the passage outside.  A long,
white, bony hand appeared through the opening, gently pushing the door,
which was prevented from working freely on its hinges by a fold in the
carpet under it.

SONGS, CHORUSES, AND CONCERTED PIECES FROM 'THE VILLAGE COQUETTES'

I spent the night at Uncle Pumblechook's, and the next morning after
breakfast we proceeded to Miss Havisham's.  It was a dismal looking
house with a great many iron bars to it. Some of the windows had been
walled up, and the others were rustily barred.  There was a courtyard in
front, which was also barred; so we had to wait, after ringing the bell,
for some one to open it.

[Illustration: NELL AND HER GRANDFATHER.]

The statuary gives him back the paper, and points out, with his pocket
rule, the words, “beloved and only child.”

[Sidenote: Mr. David Roberts, R.A.]

Though everybody was convinced that the father and his two sons had
been poisoned, yet nothing but very vague suspicions were entertained
as to the perpetrators of the crime. Nobody thought of St. Croix as
having had anything to do with it. He had for a long time ceased, to
all appearance, to have any connexion with Madame de Brinvillier; and
La Chaussée, the immediate agent, had played his part so well, that he
was never suspected.

With these words the worthy woman, who appeared to have dropped in
to take tea as a delicate little attention, rather than to have any
engagement on the premises in an official capacity, crossed to Mr
Chuffey, who was seated in the same corner as of old, and shook him by
the shoulder.

‘You had better step into the marquee, I think, Sir,’ said one very
stout gentleman, whose body and legs looked like half a gigantic roll of
flannel, elevated on a couple of inflated pillow-cases.

“Carstone,” he repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his
forefinger; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a
separate finger. “Yes. There was the name of Barbary, and the name of
Clare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.”

"Bless my soul, how unlucky! To think that I should have been only five
minutes too late, and such a run as I had for it! Excuse the liberty
I am taking, but have you any wish to be off your bargain, sir?--not
that I am particularly anxious about the picture--I merely ask for
information; that's all, sir, I assure you," added the virtuoso, aware
that he had committed himself, and endeavouring to retrieve his blunder.

Behold me, on the morrow, in a much-worn little white hat, with a black
crape round it for my mother, a black jacket, and a pair of hard stiff
corduroy trousers--which Miss Murdstone considered the best armour for
the legs in that fight with the world which was now to come off: behold
me so attired, and with my little worldly all before me in a small
trunk, sitting, a lone lorn child (as Mrs. Gummidge might have said), in
the postchaise that was carrying Mr. Quinion to the London coach at
Yarmouth! See, how our house and church are lessening in the distance;
how the grave beneath the tree is blotted out by intervening objects;
how the spire points upward from my old playground no more, and the sky
is empty!

"I never could a-bear that Job," said Mary.

Although he asked this question of Martin, he did not look towards him,
but kept his eyes on Mr Pecksniff as before. It appeared to have become
a habit with him, both in a literal and figurative sense, to look to Mr
Pecksniff alone.

‘Well said, brother; nothing could be better said,’ he ventured to
observe. ‘We’ll eat and drink of the best, and sleep our best, and make
the best of it every way. Anything can be got for money. Let’s spend it
merrily.’

They were old Chimes, trust me. Centuries ago, these Bells had been
baptized by bishops: so many centuries ago, that the register of their
baptism was lost long, long before the memory of man, and no one knew
their names. They had had their Godfathers and Godmothers, these Bells
(for my part, by the way, I would rather incur the responsibility of
being Godfather to a Bell than a Boy), and had had their silver mugs, no
doubt, besides. But Time had mowed down their sponsors, and Henry the
Eighth had melted down their mugs; and they now hung, nameless and
mugless, in the church tower.

At this the vizier paused, and, reflecting a while, said, "You will then
live in a corner, and write to us for instructions; but do not lose any
opportunity of making good hits in penknives, broad-cloth, and virgins."

A pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer. Mr. Krook,
with his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.

"Do you think it is nonsense?" returned Dora, without looking at me.
"Are you sure it is?"

‘Well Lizzie-Mizzie-Wizzie,’ said she, breaking off in her song, ‘what’s
the news out of doors?’

"From what, then?"

As nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark, Nell at length took
courage, and when he had resumed his pipe and seat, ventured to draw
near, leading her grandfather by the hand.  The slight noise they made
in raising the latch of the wicket-gate, caught his attention.  He
looked at them kindly but seemed disappointed too, and slightly shook
his head.

For the first time the hand appeared to shake.

1854.

"He was a fine-looking man when I married him, Trot--and he was sadly
changed!"

‘Something in this way, old feller,’ said Charly. As he said it,
Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it
erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a
curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively
pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and
the same thing.

[Illustration: "IT'S SUMMAT RUN DOWN IN THE FOG"--Book 3, Chap. ii.]

Ever, my dearest Macready, your most affectionate.

‘Of course not,’ replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the
two ladies. ‘I know his whole history: but we can talk about that
presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves
made their attempt, I suppose?’

Quick in all his motions, John was turning round to desire the women to
leave the room; when the sick man held him by the sleeve.

‘I will.’

CHAPTER XVIII

‘He HAS a beautiful smile,’ thought Miss Squeers.

"No," replied the voice; "God forbid!"

"Nay, Annie," said the Doctor, mildly, "I have never doubted you, my
child. There is no need; indeed there is no need, my dear."

Mr Pecksniff suddenly became full of interest.

“How much?”

‘My son,’ said Mr. Weller, as they came out of the banking-house--‘my
son and me has a wery partickler engagement this arternoon, and I should
like to have this here bis’ness settled out of hand, so let’s jest go
straight avay someveres, vere ve can hordit the accounts.’

“Then you see a man, Sir, who would go through fire and water to serve
Dombey,” returned Major Bagstock.

‘Fetch a doctor,’ quoth Miss Abbey. And then, ‘Fetch his daughter.’ On
both of which errands, quick messengers depart.

“None,”

Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eyebrows, and a
half-closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was
disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.
The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she
suddenly checked herself, and, with several gracious smiles upon Mr.
Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes'
time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing, upon which Miss
Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time
to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way
himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her: and they went
away together, followed at a little distance by the dog, who slunk out
of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.

“There’s a general indraught that way,” observed the happy Captain.
“Wind and water sets in that direction, you see. Look at his being
present t’other day!”

"There, there--good morning--good morning--now pray, my dear sirs,--Mr.
Lowten, the door!" cried the little man, pushing Dodson and Fogg,
nothing loath, out of the office; "this way, my dear sirs,--now pray
don't prolong this--dear me--Mr. Lowten--the door, sir--why don't you
attend?"

"Yes, yes," said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes
almost starting out of it.

‘You should be careful not to irritate her, James. Her temper has been
soured, remember, and ought not to be tried.’

Mr. Snodgrass seized his friend's hand warmly, as he enthusiastically
replied, "Not for worlds!"

“I won’t, not unless I wos to see HIM a-coming, sir.”

While they were thus employed, a tallish gentleman with a hook nose and
black hair, dressed in a military surtout very short and tight in the
sleeves, and which had once been frogged and braided all over, but was
now sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbare--dressed too in
ancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg, and a pair of pumps
in the winter of their existence--looked in at the door and smiled
affably.  Mrs Jarley’s back being then towards him, the military
gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to
apprise her of his presence, and stealing up close behind her, tapped
her on the neck, and cried playfully ‘Boh!’

But the boy declined the invitation until his master was apparently a
little off his guard, when he darted in and seizing the weapon tried to
wrest it from his grasp. Quilp, who was as strong as a lion, easily
kept his hold until the boy was tugging at it with his utmost power,
when he suddenly let it go and sent him reeling backwards, so that he
fell violently upon his head. The success of this manoeuvre tickled Mr
Quilp beyond description, and he laughed and stamped upon the ground as
at a most irresistible jest.

Mrs. Squeers looked vastly gracious on receiving this reply; and nodding
to Squeers, as much as to say that she was glad to find the young man
knew his station, assisted Nicholas to a slice of meat with her own fair
hands.

I should have written to you much sooner, but that I have been home from
the United States barely three months, and have since been a little
uncertain as to the precise time and way of sending my youngest son out
to join his brother Alfred.

“Good!” said the old woman. “One child dead, and one child living: one
wife dead, and one wife coming. Go and meet her!”

‘One night, after a day’s sport in which he had outdone Nimrod or
Gillingwater, and slaughtered “another fine bear,” and brought him home
in triumph, the Baron Von Koeldwethout sat moodily at the head of his
table, eyeing the smoky roof of the hall with a discontented aspect. He
swallowed huge bumpers of wine, but the more he swallowed, the more
he frowned. The gentlemen who had been honoured with the dangerous
distinction of sitting on his right and left, imitated him to a miracle
in the drinking, and frowned at each other.

We are now to regard Sheridan in a new character. Hitherto we have
seen him as the triumphant dramatist,--we are now to see him as the
triumphant orator. He had always, from his first entrance into public
life, had a strong predilection for politics; and the acquaintance
with Burke, Fox, Wyndham, and other eminent statesmen, which he made
at Johnson's Literary Club, decided him on trying his chance in the
House of Commons. Accordingly, in 1780, he stood, and was returned,
for Stafford; and made his first speech, as an avowed partisan of
Fox, in the November of that year, on the presentation of a petition
complaining of his undue election. Though he was listened to with marked
attention, yet so general was the impression that he had failed, that
the well-known printer, Woodfall, who happened to be in the gallery at
the time, said to him, as they quitted the house together, "Oratory is
not your forte; you had much better have stuck to the drama;" on which
Sheridan impatiently interrupted him with, "It is in me, however, and,
by G--! it shall come out."

“Besides which, it was nothing to you, you know, whether he was or
not,” says Judy. Also with a secretly glistening eye.

“None at all.  It’s as good a name for me as any other you could call me
by.  But may I ask you a question in the corner here?”

“And you could leave me!” said the old woman, flinging her arms about
his neck. “You could go away, and grow almost out of knowledge, and
never come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were, proud
lad! Oho, Oho!”

‘SECTION D.—MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

"Oh, la!" said Mrs. Figsby, "that may do for Persians, but it won't do
for Englishmen. They must be fairly represented; and, if such men as
Figsby are not elected, it is a great shame, and the country will go to
rack and ruin."

I HAVE been looking on, this evening, at a merry company of children
assembled round that pretty German toy, a Christmas Tree.  The tree was
planted in the middle of a great round table, and towered high above
their heads.  It was brilliantly lighted by a multitude of little tapers;
and everywhere sparkled and glittered with bright objects.  There were
rosy-cheeked dolls, hiding behind the green leaves; and there were real
watches (with movable hands, at least, and an endless capacity of being
wound up) dangling from innumerable twigs; there were French-polished
tables, chairs, bedsteads, wardrobes, eight-day clocks, and various other
articles of domestic furniture (wonderfully made, in tin, at
Wolverhampton), perched among the boughs, as if in preparation for some
fairy housekeeping; there were jolly, broad-faced little men, much more
agreeable in appearance than many real men—and no wonder, for their heads
took off, and showed them to be full of sugar-plums; there were fiddles
and drums; there were tambourines, books, work-boxes, paint-boxes,
sweetmeat-boxes, peep-show boxes, and all kinds of boxes; there were
trinkets for the elder girls, far brighter than any grown-up gold and
jewels; there were baskets and pincushions in all devices; there were
guns, swords, and banners; there were witches standing in enchanted rings
of pasteboard, to tell fortunes; there were teetotums, humming-tops,
needle-cases, pen-wipers, smelling-bottles, conversation-cards,
bouquet-holders; real fruit, made artificially dazzling with gold leaf;
imitation apples, pears, and walnuts, crammed with surprises; in short,
as a pretty child, before me, delightedly whispered to another pretty
child, her bosom friend, “There was everything, and more.”  This motley
collection of odd objects, clustering on the tree like magic fruit, and
flashing back the bright looks directed towards it from every side—some
of the diamond-eyes admiring it were hardly on a level with the table,
and a few were languishing in timid wonder on the bosoms of pretty
mothers, aunts, and nurses—made a lively realisation of the fancies of
childhood; and set me thinking how all the trees that grow and all the
things that come into existence on the earth, have their wild adornments
at that well-remembered time.

But now, that his part was played out for the evening, and when in
turning his back upon the Jew he came off the stage, he was thoughtful
himself. ‘How did Lightwood’s catechism run?’ he murmured, as he stopped
to light his cigar. ‘What is to come of it? What are you doing? Where
are you going? We shall soon know now. Ah!’ with a heavy sigh.

"Open the door," she said; "and stand there close beside me, while I
speak to him, outside."

‘Mr. Craggs, sir,’ observed Snitchey, ‘didn’t find life, I regret to say,
as easy to have and to hold as his theory made it out, or he would have
been among us now.  It’s a great loss to me.  He was my right arm, my
right leg, my right ear, my right eye, was Mr. Craggs.  I am paralytic
without him.  He bequeathed his share of the business to Mrs. Craggs, her
executors, administrators, and assigns.  His name remains in the Firm to
this hour.  I try, in a childish sort of a way, to make believe,
sometimes, he’s alive.  You may observe that I speak for Self and
Craggs—deceased, sir—deceased,’ said the tender-hearted attorney, waving
his pocket-handkerchief.

[83] Mr. Jones married Mr. Reeve's only daughter, and thus became
possessed of the share in the Sadler's Wells Theatre that had been
purchased by that eminent musician.

‘Hush!’ repeated Flora, ‘I have now told you all, confidence is
established between us hush, for Arthur’s sake I will always be a friend
to you my dear girl and in Arthur’s name you may always rely upon me.’

In your paper, sent to me this morning, I see the correspondent mentions
one ----, and records how I was wont to feast in the house of the said
----. As I never was in the man's house in my life, or within five miles
of it that I know of, I beg you will do me the favour to contradict
this.

The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however; for
when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and
to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.

Mrs Varden with a faint smile gently reproved her attendant for this
enthusiasm, and reminded her at the same time that she was far too
unwell to venture out that day.

“So, Dame Trot,” observed my guardian, shutting up his book one night
when we were all three together, “so Woodcourt has restored Caddy
Jellyby to the full enjoyment of life again?”

Isabel was dressing for a party when Laura showed her Sally’s letter.
“Poor Fanny,” said she, “I wish I had known it before I bought this
wreath. I have, absolutely, not a half-franc in the world. Will you buy
the wreath of me at half-price, it has not even been taken from its
box.”

‘Father?’

You never will derive so much delight from seeing a glorious little
woman in the arms of a third party as you would have felt if you had
seen Dot run into the Carrier's embrace. It was the most complete,
unmitigated, soul-fraught little piece of earnestness that ever you
beheld in all your days.

I felt ashamed to address him; for, had I not been most uncourteous,
most repulsive to him? and now I wanted another favour. I stood before
the table at which he sat, and watched his countenance as he seemed
engrossed with his Oriental literature; but it was only for a moment,
for he raised his eyes by some sudden impulse, and fixed them straight
upon me.

In the month of Janus,

We next find Captain Boldheart about three leagues off Madeira,
surveying through his spy-glass a stranger of suspicious appearance
making sail towards him. On his firing a gun ahead of her to bring
her to, she ran up a flag, which he instantly recognized as the flag
from the mast in the back-garden at home.

"(I wouldn't keep on touchin' it, if I was you, sir.)  I'll tell you if

Mr and Mrs Lammle’s house in Sackville Street, Piccadilly, was but
a temporary residence. It has done well enough, they informed their
friends, for Mr Lammle when a bachelor, but it would not do now. So,
they were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations,
and always very nearly taking or buying one, but never quite concluding
the bargain. Hereby they made for themselves a shining little reputation
apart. People said, on seeing a vacant palatial residence, ‘The very
thing for the Lammles!’ and wrote to the Lammles about it, and the
Lammles always went to look at it, but unfortunately it never exactly
answered. In short, they suffered so many disappointments, that they
began to think it would be necessary to build a palatial residence.
And hereby they made another shining reputation; many persons of their
acquaintance becoming by anticipation dissatisfied with their own
houses, and envious of the non-existent Lammle structure.

With this, and with a whole brood of ducks, Joey backed out of the
presence.  But Joey being a privileged person, and even an involuntary
conquest being pleasant to youth and beauty, Marguerite merrily looked
out for him next time.

‘Mr Gashford, I find, was right,’ said Lord George; ‘I thought him
prejudiced, though I ought to have known a man like him better than to
have supposed it possible!’

Faithfully yours always.

One evening, as I was ascending the stairs, I overheard the child
inquiring of one of the servants "who that white-haired gentleman was,
and why he lived in the house?" I had hitherto refused to see the child;
but I now rang the bell, and ordered the housekeeper, who constantly
waited upon me, to bring him to me.

"True--most true," chimed in Nugent, laughing; "for, according to the
words of the pt,

There lay before us, that same afternoon, the broken bridge of Avignon,
and all the city baking in the sun; yet with an under-done-pie-crust,
battlemented wall, that never will be brown, though it bake for
centuries.

‘Quite right--quite right,’ said the little man.

Mrs Chick and Miss Tox were convoked in council at dinner next day; and
when the cloth was removed, Mr Dombey opened the proceedings by
requiring to be informed, without any gloss or reservation, whether
there was anything the matter with Paul, and what Mr Pilkins said about
him.

‘And this, sir,’ Silas would say to his patron, sadly nodding his head
and musing, ‘was once Our House! This, sir, is the building from which I
have so often seen those great creatures, Miss Elizabeth, Master
George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker’—whose very names were of his own
inventing—‘pass and repass! And has it come to this, indeed! Ah dear
me, dear me!’

‘No, if you please. Never.’

But the Major, having secured an attentive listener, and a smiler who
had not his match in all the world—“in short, a devilish intelligent
and able fellow,” as he often afterwards declared—was not going to let
him off with a little slyness personal to Mr Dombey. Therefore, on the
removal of the cloth, the Major developed himself as a choice spirit in
the broader and more comprehensive range of narrating regimental
stories, and cracking regimental jokes, which he did with such prodigal
exuberance, that Carker was (or feigned to be) quite exhausted with
laughter and admiration: while Mr Dombey looked on over his starched
cravat, like the Major’s proprietor, or like a stately showman who was
glad to see his bear dancing well.

‘Are you going back those many thousand miles, so soon?’ asked Agnes.

‘Yes,’ cried the old man, turning upon him with gleaming eyes, ‘it was.
It is.  It will be, till I die.’

As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
light, and looked at her.

Chapter 1

It now fell very dark, indeed.  I have seldom, if ever, seen it darker,
nor yet so dark.  The moon was not due until one in the morning, and it
was but a little after nine when our men lay down where they were
mustered.  It was pretended that they were to take a nap, but everybody
knew that no nap was to be got under the circumstances.  Though all were
very quiet, there was a restlessness among the people; much what I have
seen among the people on a race-course, when the bell has rung for the
saddling for a great race with large stakes on it.

Mr. Pickwick's case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner,
up to this point, that it could very well afford to have any additional
suspicion cast upon it. But as it could afford to be placed in a rather
better light, if possible, Mr. Phunky rose for the purpose of getting
something important out of Mr. Winkle in cross-examination. Whether he
did get anything important out of him will immediately appear.

“We can go no farther,” said Reymund. “This spot is more sheltered than
any we are likely to find. Let us do what we can for comfort, and wait
for the morning.”

[Sidenote: Mrs. Cowden Clarke.]

‘I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny.’

‘The heavy blow,’ said the old lady, ‘of losing the dear girl who
has so long been my comfort and happiness.’

Seeing no better way out of it, Veneering here pulls up his oratorical
Pegasus extremely short, and plumps down, clean over his head, with:
‘Lammle, God bless you!’

“Will you see my mother safe there in a coach, Mrs. Bagnet? But of
course I know you will. Why should I ask it!”

‘Hard-heartedness and evil-doing will never prosper, sir,’ said Mr
Snawley.

"Your daughter, my good friend?"

Their entertainer had sat perfectly quiet in the beginning of this
dispute, looking first at one man and then at the other, as if he were
lying in wait for an opportunity of putting some further question, or
reverting to that from which the discourse had strayed.  But, from the
point where Mr Codlin was charged with sleepiness, he had shown an
increasing interest in the discussion: which now attained a very high
pitch.

These remarks, which were addressed in the midst of a frightful din and
turmoil to those immediately about him, were received with great favour;
not so much, perhaps, because of the hangman’s eloquence, as on account
of the locksmith’s obstinacy. Gabriel was in imminent peril, and he knew
it; but he preserved a steady silence; and would have done so, if they
had been debating whether they should roast him at a slow fire.

‘You hound!’ said Nicholas. ‘If you were but a younger man--’

Then and not before, did Trotty see in every Bell a bearded figure of the
bulk and stature of the Bell—incomprehensibly, a figure and the Bell
itself.  Gigantic, grave, and darkly watchful of him, as he stood rooted
to the ground.

‘Well,’ said the man on the other side, ‘I think you had, perhaps.’

What is it that makes it so hard sometimes to determine whither we will
walk? I believe that there is a subtle magnetism in Nature which, if we
unconsciously yield to it, will direct us aright. It is not indifferent
to us which way we walk. There is a right way; but we are very liable
from heedlessness and stupidity to take the wrong one. We would fain
take that walk, never yet taken by us through this actual world, which
is perfectly symbolical of the path which we love to travel in the
interior and ideal world; and sometimes, no doubt, we find it difficult
to choose our direction, because it does not yet exist distinctly in
our idea.

‘A quaint place this,’ said the gentleman--and his voice was as rich as
his dress. ‘Are you the landlord?’

Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under
the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on
the grass on the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole
cautiously towards the house.

"Simply enough.  We have to suppose a motive; let us say it was
revenge, and see whether that will furnish a clue."

He would very much like, he said, to see England before he died; and
spoke with much interest about the great things to be seen there.  When I
told him of that chamber in the British Museum wherein are preserved
household memorials of a race that ceased to be, thousands of years ago,
he was very attentive, and it was not hard to see that he had a reference
in his mind to the gradual fading away of his own people.

"I'm half ashamed to wear it, though," said Caleb, watching the effect
of what he said upon her brightening face, "upon my word! When I hear
the boys and people say behind me, 'Halloa! Here's a swell!' I don't
know which way to look. And when the beggar wouldn't go away last night;
and, when I said I was a very common man, said, 'No, your Honour! Bless
your Honour, don't say that!' I was quite ashamed. I really felt as if I
hadn't a right to wear it."

And if you have a mind
    For sweet, sad thoughts inclined,
    In _Glendalough_ you'll find
          Them nigh:--
    _Kathleen_ and _Kevin's_ tale
    So sorrows that deep vale,
    That birds all songless sail
          Its sky--
          Its sky--sky,--
    That birds all songless sail
          Its sky!

‘I’ve got ‘em,’ replied Sikes.

‘Not at all,’ replied Sikes coldly.

‘A little puss, it is!’ said Mr. Peggotty, patting her with his great
hand.

'There was such a game with Fogg here, this mornin',' said the man in
    the brown coat, 'while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers, and you
    two were gone to the stamp-office.  Fogg was down here opening the
    letters, when that chap we issued the writ against at Camberwell, you
    know, came in--what's his name again?'

"Odd," said the old gentleman, taking the gun. "Never knew one of them
miss fire before. Why, I don't see anything of the cap."

Says Turpin, "You shall eat your words,
    With a sarse of leaden bul-let;"
    So he puts a pistol to his mouth,
    And he fires it down his gullet.
    The coachman he not likin' the job,
    Set off at a full gal-lop,
    But Dick put a couple of balls in his nob,
    And perwailed on him to stop.

A few seconds brought me to Sergeant Drooce's hut.  He was fast asleep,
and being a heavy sleeper, I had to lay my hand upon him to rouse him.
The instant I touched him he came rolling out of his hammock, and upon me
like a tiger.  And a tiger he was, except that he knew what he was up to,
in his utmost heat, as well as any man.

Thanks for your paper, which I have sent to the Printer's with much
pleasure.

‘I never could a-bear that Job,’ said Mary.

CHAPTER 29. — I VISIT STEERFORTH AT HIS HOME, AGAIN

‘“Lor, sir!” exclaimed the widow.

“But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear! You are
faint of heart to-night, my dear!”

‘Indeed, ma’am?’ returned Mr Pancks, with a wandering eye towards the
figure of the little seamstress on her knee picking threads and fraying
of her work from the carpet. ‘You look nicely, ma’am.’

‘“We give thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleased thee to deliver
this our sister out of the miseries of this sinful world.”’ So read the
Reverend Frank Milvey in a not untroubled voice, for his heart misgave
him that all was not quite right between us and our sister—or say our
sister in Law—Poor Law—and that we sometimes read these words in an
awful manner, over our Sister and our Brother too.

“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t you
see?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her
apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in
particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully
contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a
bruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of her
hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?
Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of
brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not
have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles
were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the
fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have
been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little
spots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made
was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that
she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the
murder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years
old—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:
“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and
we show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and
you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept
all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have
destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have
scratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder
of her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you _will_ have
scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted
for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented
them?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too
many for the jury, and they gave in.”

Here Mr. Pickwick, who had been writhing in silence for some time, gave
a violent start, as if some vague idea of assaulting Serjeant Buzfuz,
in the august presence of justice and law, suggested itself to his
mind. An admonitory gesture from Perker restrained him, and he listened
to the learned gentleman's continuation with a look of indignation,
which contrasted forcibly with the admiring faces of Mrs. Cluppins and
Mrs. Sanders.

“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorry
for that; I didn’t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be
comfortable.”

After stating this curious and unexpected fact, Mr Toots fell into a
deep well of silence.

"Please may I"--the spirit of that little creatur, and the way he kept
his rising tears down!--"please, dear pa--may I--kiss Norah before I go?"

On which the Billickin would retort (Rosa not having spoken a word),
“If you was better accustomed to butcher’s meat, Miss, you would not
entertain the idea of a lamb’s fry. Firstly, because lambs has long
been sheep, and secondly, because there is such things as killing-days,
and there is not. As to roast fowls, Miss, why you must be quite
surfeited with roast fowls, letting alone your buying, when you market
for yourself, the agedest of poultry with the scaliest of legs, quite
as if you was accustomed to picking ’em out for cheapness. Try a little
inwention, Miss. Use yourself to ’ousekeeping a bit. Come now, think of
somethink else.”

Upon this, the women set up a loud and dismal screaming; and rushing in
small parties before their favourite brothers, flung their arms around
them to preserve them from danger. An instance of affection, which had
nearly proved fatal to Humm, who, being extremely popular, was all but
suffocated, by the crowd of female devotees that hung about his neck,
and heaped caresses upon him. The greater part of the lights were
quickly put out, and nothing but noise and confusion resounded on all
sides.

What has he got in his hand now?  More cucumbers?  No.  A long strip of
paper.  It’s the bill.

‘And what does the boy mean,’ added Mr Willet, after he had stared at
him for a little time, in a species of stupefaction, ‘by cocking his
hat, to such an extent! Are you going to kill the wintner, sir?’

“Oh, indeed, sir?” returns the stationer, expressing by a cough that
he is quite in the dark as to who Mr. Bucket may be.

As Janet curtsied, hoping I was well, I observed my aunt's visage
lengthen very much.

‘The gentleman, father.’

‘No.’

My reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was
announced. Mr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet's aunt. Mr. Henry Spiker
took Mrs. Waterbrook. Agnes, whom I should have liked to take myself,
was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs. Uriah, Traddles, and I,
as the junior part of the company, went down last, how we could. I was
not so vexed at losing Agnes as I might have been since it gave me an
opportunity of making myself known to Traddles on the stairs, who
greeted me with great fervor: while Uriah writhed with such obtrusive
satisfaction and self-abasement, that I could gladly have pitched him
over the bannisters.

‘Beg him to walk this way,’ said the single gentleman.  ‘I should be
glad to exchange a word with him, tell him.  Beg him to come at once,
do you hear?’

In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly
resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one
effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled
with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.

"Keep the pot a bilin', sir!" said Sam; and down went Wardle again, and
then Mr. Pickwick, and then Sam, and then Mr. Winkle, and then Mr. Bob
Sawyer, and then the fat boy, and then Mr. Snodgrass, following closely
upon each other's heels, and running after each other with as much
eagerness as if all their future prospects in life depended on their
expedition.

BOB. Why, that you were a good wife! and he was so kind--it was quite
delightful! He said he'd get Peter a better situation--and, mark me,
whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget
poor Tiny Tim, shall we, or this first parting that was among us?

Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that
not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.

He found him in a dull room, fadedly furnished, much as I had found
him in his barrack-room but a little while before, except that he was
not writing but was sitting with a book before him, from which his
eyes and thoughts were far astray. As the door chanced to be standing
open, Mr. Woodcourt was in his presence for some moments without
being perceived, and he told me that he never could forget the
haggardness of his face and the dejection of his manner before he was
aroused from his dream.

‘And do you go too, ma’am?’

FOOTNOTES:

‘Oh, now pray don’t mention it,’ interrupted Mrs. Porter; ‘it’s most
absurd—quite as absurd as young What’s-his-name saying he wondered how
Miss Caroline, with such a foot and ankle, could have the vanity to
play _Fenella_.’

“I covet nothing,” said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.
“Possession is nothing to me. Here is my friend Jarndyce’s excellent
house. I feel obliged to him for possessing it. I can sketch it and
alter it. I can set it to music. When I am here, I have sufficient
possession of it and have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility.
My steward’s name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he can’t cheat me. We
have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a
strong will and immense power of business detail, who throws herself
into objects with surprising ardour! I don’t regret that I have not a
strong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself
into objects with surprising ardour. I can admire her without envy. I
can sympathize with the objects. I can dream of them. I can lie down
on the grass—in fine weather—and float along an African river,
embracing all the natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and
sketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I
were there. I don’t know that it’s of any direct use my doing so, but
it’s all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then, for heaven’s sake,
having Harold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the
world, an agglomeration of practical people of business habits, to
let him live and admire the human family, do it somehow or other,
like good souls, and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!”

BOSTON, _December 4th, 1867._

‘Ay, but I have only one motive in life, Miss Trotwood,’ he rejoined,
smiling. ‘Other people have dozens, scores, hundreds. I have only one.
There’s the difference. However, that’s beside the question. The best
school? Whatever the motive, you want the best?’

"Could you do it?" urged Mr. Squeers.

She stopped here; for there was so much heart in her altered tone and
manner, that Nicholas was quite moved.

LITTLE DORRIT.  _From "Little Dorrit"_                49

Very faithfully yours.

‘What a pleasant thing filial piety is to contemplate! If the daughter
of the Baron Von Swillenhausen had pleaded a preoccupied heart, or
fallen at her father’s feet and corned them in salt tears, or
only fainted away, and complimented the old gentleman in frantic
ejaculations, the odds are a hundred to one but Swillenhausen Castle
would have been turned out at window, or rather the baron turned out at
window, and the castle demolished. The damsel held her peace, however,
when an early messenger bore the request of Von Koeldwethout next
morning, and modestly retired to her chamber, from the casement of which
she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue. She was no sooner
assured that the horseman with the large moustachios was her proffered
husband, than she hastened to her father’s presence, and expressed her
readiness to sacrifice herself to secure his peace. The venerable baron
caught his child to his arms, and shed a wink of joy.

‘Heyday!’ asked Martin, starting at the mention of a name he knew.
‘Pray, what does he want with me?’

‘Take a seat. And would you please to shut the street door first? I
can’t very well do it myself; because my back’s so bad, and my legs are
so queer.’

The mention of a sum which she knew she _had not_, coupled with the name
of husband, who she knew had not appreciated her merits, brought two
pearly drops into her eyes, which Richie would have given a quarter's
salary to be permitted to kiss off, and which vied in size and lustre
with those that trembled in her ears; but he did what was quite as
grateful to the widow,--he summoned a little moisture into his own. This
sympathetic display was not lost on the considerate lady.

“Now, it’s a very singular circumstance, your ladyship,” says Mr.
Guppy, “though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of
us professional men—which I may call myself, for though not
admitted, yet I have had a present of my articles made to me by Kenge
and Carboy, on my mother’s advancing from the principal of her little
income the money for the stamp, which comes heavy—that I have
encountered the person who lived as servant with the lady who brought
Miss Summerson up before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of her. That lady
was a Miss Barbary, your ladyship.”

Giddy, and bloody, and a mere bundle of rags, is Pickle of Portici when
we reach the place where we dismounted, and where the horses are waiting;
but, thank God, sound in limb!  And never are we likely to be more glad
to see a man alive and on his feet, than to see him now—making light of
it too, though sorely bruised and in great pain.  The boy is brought into
the Hermitage on the Mountain, while we are at supper, with his head tied
up; and the man is heard of, some hours afterwards.  He too is bruised
and stunned, but has broken no bones; the snow having, fortunately,
covered all the larger blocks of rock and stone, and rendered them
harmless.

"Why, I was thinking that this evening would be a good time, Steerforth,
when they are all sitting round the fire. I should like you to see it
when it's snug, it's such a curious place."

‘And I,’ said Mr Lammle, ‘to Georgiana.’

Even while gazing on this animated liquid luster, a buoyant delight
seemed infused into my senses; all terrors conceived before were
annulled; the phantoms, whose armies had filled the wide spaces in
front, were forgotten; the crash of the forest behind was unheard.
In the reflection of that glory, Margrave's wan cheek seemed
already restored to the radiance it wore when I saw it first in the
framework of blooms.

John was a good deal scandalised by this observance, but seeing that
Mr Haredale took little heed of what Hugh said or did, and that his
thoughts were otherwise employed, he offered no apology, and went in
silence down the stairs, across the walk, and through the garden-gate.
They stopped upon the outer side for Hugh to hold the light while Mr
Haredale locked it on the inner; and then John saw with wonder (as he
often afterwards related), that he was very pale, and that his face
had changed so much and grown so haggard since their entrance, that he
almost seemed another man.

‘I am thinking how to do so,’ said brother Charles; sadly, as it
seemed to his young friend, and with an expression allied to pain. ‘You
accidentally saw a young lady in this room one morning, my dear sir, in
a fainting fit. Do you remember? Perhaps you have forgotten.’

Rob again assured the Captain that he would be prompt and wakeful; and
the Captain having made this prudent arrangement, went home to Mrs
MacStinger’s for the last time.

[Illustration: "YOU HAVE HEARD MISS MURDSTONE," SAID MR. SPENLOW,
TURNING TO ME. "I BEG TO ASK MR. COPPERFIELD, IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO
SAY IN REPLY!"--Chap. xxxviii.]

After this speech, Miss Nipper, who was perfectly serious, wiped her
eyes.

‘Dear me!’ said Mrs. Dowler. ‘You must knock again, if you please.’

‘But now,’ said Miss Knag, glancing at the reflection of herself in a
mirror at no great distance, ‘I love her--I quite love her--I declare I
do!’

“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought
Mr. Pip into the office. Here it is.” He handed it to his principal
instead of to me.

‘He shall be taught,’ said Mr. Hawkyard, ‘(O, yes, he shall be taught!)
but what is to be done with him for the present?  He may be infected.  He
may disseminate infection.’  The ring widened considerably.  ‘What is to
be done with him?’

‘I engaged a donkey-chaise shortly after writing the above, and
proceeded at a brisk trot in the direction of Sowster’s residence,
passing through a beautiful expanse of country, with red brick
buildings on either side, and stopping in the marketplace to observe
the spot where Mr. Kwakley’s hat was blown off yesterday. It is an
uneven piece of paving, but has certainly no appearance which would
lead one to suppose that any such event had recently occurred there.
From this point I proceeded—passing the gas-works and
tallow-melter’s—to a lane which had been pointed out to me as the
beadle’s place of residence; and before I had driven a dozen yards
further, I had the good fortune to meet Sowster himself advancing
towards me.

‘Oh, he’s all right,’ said Tom.

There were some lingerings of rebellion yet: Owen Glendower being
retired to Wales, and a preposterous story being spread among the
ignorant people that King Richard was still alive. How they could have
believed such nonsense it is difficult to imagine; but they certainly
did suppose that the Court fool of the late King, who was something
like him, was he, himself; so that it seemed as if, after giving so
much trouble to the country in his life, he was still to trouble it
after his death. This was not the worst. The young Earl of March and
his brother were stolen out of Windsor Castle. Being retaken, and being
found to have been spirited away by one Lady Spencer, she accused her
own brother, that Earl of Rutland who was in the former conspiracy and
was now Duke of York, of being in the plot. For this he was ruined in
fortune, though not put to death; and then another plot arose among the
old Earl of Northumberland, some other lords, and that same Scroop,
Archbishop of York, who was with the rebels before. These conspirators
caused a writing to be posted on the church doors, accusing the King of
a variety of crimes; but, the King being eager and vigilant to oppose
them, they were all taken, and the Archbishop was executed. This was
the first time that a great churchman had been slain by the law in
England; but the King was resolved that it should be done, and done it
was.

“What other reason could I possibly have?”

‘What of it?’ says Mr Lammle. ‘Have you the face to utter the word to
me?’

‘I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper,’
rejoined Mr. Pickwick.

"Your pa was once a little particular in his attentions, my dears," said
Mrs. Todgers, "but to be your ma was too much happiness denied me. You'd
hardly know who this was done for, perhaps?"

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the
clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

The sound came on in a regular tune, and as I lay hidden, I fancied the
tune so played to be, "Chris'en--George--King!  Chris'en--George--King!
Chris'en--George--King!" over and over again, always the same, with the
pauses always at the same places.  I had likewise time to make up my mind
that if these were the Pirates, I could and would (barring my being shot)
swim off to my raft, in spite of my wound, the moment I had given the
alarm, and hold my old post by Miss Maryon.

The key of the door below was now heard in the lock, and the door was
heard to open and close. In due sequence Mr Flintwinch appeared; on
whose entrance the visitor rose from his chair, laughing loud, and
folded him in a close embrace.

I have written to Chapman and requested him to send you a block of a
long shape, so that the house may come upright as it were.

“Why should you be?” asked Rose.

‘In a little community like ours, my dear,’ said Fagin, who felt it
necessary to qualify this position, ‘we have a general number one,
without considering me too as the same, and all the other young
people.’

"Well, be off with you now, Andy, and take care of what I gave you for
the squire."

‘Sir, I tell them no more than I am about to repeat. When I tell them,
“I cannot promise this, I cannot answer for the other, I must see my
principal, I have not the money, I am a poor man and it does not rest
with me,” they are so unbelieving and so impatient, that they sometimes
curse me in Jehovah’s name.’

Presently the attendant pushed open a partly closed door, which led into
a small, close room, ventilated only by one high, narrow window.

I was cold, and I trembled violently, but not a word he uttered was
lost. As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun’s rays descended,
softly shining through the leaves upon his bare head, I felt as if
the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels.

“It’s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under
heavy losses,” said Fagin. “My best hand was taken from me, yesterday
morning.”

Mr Boffin was in such severe literary difficulties that his eyes were
prominent and fixed, and his breathing was stertorous, when, to the
great relief of Mrs Boffin, who observed these symptoms with alarm, the
yard bell rang.

The clock upon his study table pointed to a few minutes short of twelve,
when his attention was called to it by a ringing at the door bell. A man
of plain habits, he had sent his servants to bed and must needs go down
to open the door. He went down, and there found a man without hat or
coat, whose shirt sleeves were rolled up tight to his shoulders. For a
moment, he thought the man had been fighting: the rather, as he was much
agitated and out of breath. A second look, however, showed him that
the man was particularly clean, and not otherwise discomposed as to his
dress than as it answered this description.

"Ireland."

The Captain sat down with the air of a man who had happily expressed
the feeling of everybody present, and immediately rose again to present
Mr Toots, who was much disconcerted by the arrival of anybody,
appearing to prefer a claim to the name of Gills.

‘Oh! Then you have no proof.’

‘Ah!’ he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. ‘Well! If you was
writin’ to her, p’raps you’d recollect to say that Barkis was willin’;
would you?’

“Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left her a natural heart,
even to be bruised or broken.”

Whether Mr. Winkle was seized with a temporary attack of that species
of insanity which originates in a sense of injury, or animated by this
display of Mr. Weller's valour, is uncertain; but certain it is, that
he no sooner saw Mr. Grummer fall than he made a terrific onslaught
on a small boy who stood next to him; whereupon Mr. Snodgrass, in
a truly Christian spirit, and in order that he might take no one
unawares, announced in a very loud tone that he was going to begin,
and proceeded to take off his coat with the utmost deliberation. He
was immediately surrounded and secured; and it is but common justice
both to him and Mr. Winkle to say, that they did not make the slightest
attempt to rescue either themselves or Mr. Weller: who, after a most
vigorous resistance, was overpowered by numbers and taken prisoner. The
procession then re-formed; the chairmen resumed their stations; and the
march was re-commenced.

By this time the merriment and happiness of the feast have gained their
height; certain ominous looks begin to be exchanged between the
bridesmaids, and somehow it gets whispered about that the carriage which
is to take the young couple into the country has arrived.  Such members
of the party as are most disposed to prolong its enjoyments, affect to
consider this a false alarm, but it turns out too true, being speedily
confirmed, first by the retirement of the bride and a select file of
intimates who are to prepare her for the journey, and secondly by the
withdrawal of the ladies generally.  To this there ensues a particularly
awkward pause, in which everybody essays to be facetious, and nobody
succeeds; at length the bridegroom makes a mysterious disappearance in
obedience to some equally mysterious signal; and the table is deserted.

‘Well! There am I, continuing with father and holding to father, because
father loves me and I love father. I can’t so much as read a book,
because, if I had learned, father would have thought I was deserting
him, and I should have lost my influence. I have not the influence I
want to have, I cannot stop some dreadful things I try to stop, but I
go on in the hope and trust that the time will come. In the meanwhile
I know that I am in some things a stay to father, and that if I was
not faithful to him he would—in revenge-like, or in disappointment, or
both—go wild and bad.’

“My friend Jobling will render me his assistance in the capacity of
clerk and will live in the ’ouse,” said Mr. Guppy. “My mother will
likewise live in the ’ouse when her present quarter in the Old Street
Road shall have ceased and expired; and consequently there will be no
want of society. My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by
taste, and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper
circles, fully backs me in the intentions I am now developing.”

‘MY good opinion,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, and the poor lady exulted in the
idea that she was marvellously sly,--‘my good opinion can be of very
little consequence to a gentleman like Sir Mulberry.’

And with that he fell down flat again, as suddenly as if he had been
shot.  Thus he remained, motionless and bereft of speech, until she had
finished her meal, put everything in its place, and swept the hearth;
when he motioned her to bring a chair to the bedside, and, being
propped up again, opened a farther conversation.

There was a pause.

"And so," said Meg, busying herself exultingly with her basket; "I'll
lay the cloth at once, father; for I have brought the tripe in a basin,
and tied the basin up in a pocket-handkerchief; and if I like to be
proud for once, and spread that for a cloth, and call it a cloth,
there's no law to prevent me; is there father?"

Releasing the hand by slow degrees, he drew all his fingers through his
prongs of hair, so that they stood up in their most portentous manner;
and repeated slowly, ‘Remember what I say, Miss Dorrit. You shall live
to see.’

I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted five
days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone down on
my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one, Miss
Murdstone excepted, during the whole time.

218

‘I don’t know her equal,’ said Squeers; ‘I do not know her equal. That
woman, Nickleby, is always the same--always the same bustling, lively,
active, saving creetur that you see her now.’

“When they had been separated for some time,” returned Mr. Brownlow,
“and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had
utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who with
prospects blighted lingered on at home, he fell among new friends.
_This_ circumstance, at least, you know already.”

‘Cert’nly,’ replied Sam. ‘If the clothes fits me half as well as the
place, they’ll do.’

Forster is out again; and if he don't go in again, after the manner in
which we have been keeping Christmas, he must be very strong indeed.
Such dinings, such dancings, such conjurings, such blindman's-buffings,
such theatre-goings, such kissings-out of old years and kissings-in of
new ones, never took place in these parts before. To keep the Chuzzlewit
going, and do this little book, the Carol, in the odd times between two
parts of it, was, as you may suppose, pretty tight work. But when it was
done I broke out like a madman. And if you could have seen me at a
children's party at Macready's the other night, going down a country
dance with Mrs. M., you would have thought I was a country gentleman of
independent property, residing on a tiptop farm, with the wind blowing
straight in my face every day. . . .

“Just like me! I did it over and over again. I have done it hundreds of
thousands of times in this room.”

‘You shall have your own way, Mark.’

"Oh, the river!" she cried passionately. "Oh, the river!"

‘Why not?’ asked Nicholas.

No answer.  An old man in a Scotch cap sitting among others on a form at
the table, eating out of a tin porringer, pushes back his cap a little to
look at us, claps it down on his forehead again with the palm of his
hand, and goes on eating.

‘Oh Jeremiah!’ cried Affery, waking. ‘What a start you gave me!’

Mr. Pickwick took up his hat, and repaired to the Peacock, but Mr.
Winkle had conveyed the intelligence of the fancy ball there, before
him.

"I beg your pardon, Mr. PINTO," I said to the person with whom I
was conversing.  (I wonder, by the way, that I was not surprised at
his knowing how fond I am of this print.)  "You spoke of the Knight
of Plympton.  Sir Joshua died 1792: and you say he was your dear
friend?"

DEAR FRIENDS,

They all answered, yes.  I had little to tell them, but I was bound by my
own proposal.  Therefore, after looking for awhile at the spiral column
of smoke wreathing up from my brown beauty, through which I could have
almost sworn I saw the effigy of Master Richard Watts less startled than
usual, I fired away.

Mr. Spiker was so interested, that he became quite stony.

"All lost, spent, wasted, pawned, borrowed and sold, eh?" said the
client, looking up.

“The ceremony of to-day,” continues Sir Leicester, “strikingly
illustrative of the respect in which my deceased friend”—he lays a
stress upon the word, for death levels all distinctions—“was held by
the flower of the land, has, I say, aggravated the shock I have
received from this most horrible and audacious crime. If it were my
brother who had committed it, I would not spare him.”

‘Didn’t you though?’ said Tom. ‘Well, it’s very likely you do find me
strange, because I have hardly seen anything of the world, and you have
seen a good deal I dare say?’

And slily he leered, as his hand up-reared
      A purse of costly mould,
    Where, bright and fresh, through a silver mesh,
      Shone forth the glistering gold.

I said: ‘Certainly, aunt.’

‘That’s the young man, I suppose—’ interrupted the mayor.

The tower opened at his feet. He looked down, and beheld his own form,
lying at the bottom, on the outside: crushed and motionless.

"It doubles our income, Doctor Strong," said I.

OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW
ASSOCIATES, AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT BUT
VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THIS HISTORY.

Mr. Pott looked dubiously at Bob Sawyer for some seconds, and, turning
to Mr. Pickwick, said:

_Spir._ What! would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I
give? Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made
this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon
my brow?

It was a very wet Sunday: raining and blowing from morning to night.  When
the bells rang for afternoon church, they seemed to ring in the commotion
of the puddles as well as in the wind, and they sounded very loud and
dismal indeed, and the street looked very dismal indeed, and the House
looked dismallest of all.

“Hush, hush!” the Spy entreats him, timidly.

“And when we come back, Florence, we will come and see his grave
again.”

He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his
friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them: the latter
gentleman eyed him closely, and at once burst into the exclamation,

IN THE VALLEY

"Milk my cow!" said the captain abstractedly.

“That is no excuse,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “You were present on the
occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more
guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that
your wife acts under your direction.”

THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN.

‘Well, and don’t you think, old feller,’ remonstrated Mr. Weller, ‘that
if you let your master take in this here young lady, you’re a precious
rascal?’

“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw
Wemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”

OUT OF THE SEASON

"My love, be silent," said Mrs. Micawber, laying her brown glove on his
hand. "I may have a conviction, Mr. Copperfield, that Mr. Micawber's
manners peculiarly qualify him for the Banking business. I may argue
within myself, that if _I_ had a deposit at a banking-house, the
manners of Mr. Micawber, as representing that banking-house, would
inspire confidence, and must extend the connexion. But if the various
banking-houses refuse to avail themselves of Mr. Micawber's abilities,
or receive the offer of them with contumely, what is the use of
dwelling upon _that_ idea? None. As to originating a banking-business,
I may know that there are members of my family who, if they chose to
place their money in Mr. Micawber's hands, might found an establishment
of that description. But if they do _not_ choose to place their money
in Mr. Micawber's hands--which they don't--what is the use of that?
Again I contend that we are no farther advanced than we were before."

The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not
to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.

_Mrs. Badger._ Plain walking dress. Bonnet and shawl.

It was so settled. I then led him out into the street, impelled to tell
the news, yet dreading the effect; not daring to make the revelation in
my office for fear of a scene.

"Oh no! Mind, I don't say that; I expressly say that he's a devilish
gentlemanly fellow," said Mr. Smangle. "But I think, perhaps, if
somebody went down, just to see that he didn't dip his beak into the
jug by accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money
as he came up-stairs, it would be as well. Here, you sir, just run
down-stairs, and look after that gentleman, will you?"

"Now," said I to myself, as I looked at the knocker, "I know I am not a
Proctor; I wonder whether I am a Rogue!"

“You know, you she devil!” returned the robber, suppressing his breath.
“You were watched tonight; every word you said was heard.”

The way we came to be married rather sooner than we intended, was this.
I took a frugal lodging and was saving and planning for her sake, when,
one day, she spoke to me with great earnestness, and said:

‘Hear me, Mary,’ said Mr Haredale kindly, as he motioned her to walk
with him towards the house. ‘Your life has been an example of patience
and fortitude, except in this one particular which has often given me
great pain. It is enough to know that you were cruelly involved in the
calamity which deprived me of an only brother, and Emma of her father,
without being obliged to suppose (as I sometimes am) that you associate
us with the author of our joint misfortunes.’

‘Where?’ inquired Mr. Magnus, ‘where?’

"Certainly."

There is little more than one variety in the appearance of the country,
for the first two days.  From a dreary plain, to an interminable avenue,
and from an interminable avenue to a dreary plain again.  Plenty of vines
there are in the open fields, but of a short low kind, and not trained in
festoons, but about straight sticks.  Beggars innumerable there are,
everywhere; but an extraordinarily scanty population, and fewer children
than I ever encountered.  I don’t believe we saw a hundred children
between Paris and Chalons.  Queer old towns, draw-bridged and walled:
with odd little towers at the angles, like grotesque faces, as if the
wall had put a mask on, and were staring down into the moat; other
strange little towers, in gardens and fields, and down lanes, and in
farm-yards: all alone, and always round, with a peaked roof, and never
used for any purpose at all; ruinous buildings of all sorts; sometimes an
hôtel de ville, sometimes a guard-house, sometimes a dwelling-house,
sometimes a château with a rank garden, prolific in dandelion, and
watched over by extinguisher-topped turrets, and blink-eyed little
casements; are the standard objects, repeated over and over again.
Sometimes we pass a village inn, with a crumbling wall belonging to it,
and a perfect town of out-houses; and painted over the gateway, ‘Stabling
for Sixty Horses;’ as indeed there might be stabling for sixty score,
were there any horses to be stabled there, or anybody resting there, or
anything stirring about the place but a dangling bush, indicative of the
wine inside: which flutters idly in the wind, in lazy keeping with
everything else, and certainly is never in a green old age, though always
so old as to be dropping to pieces.  And all day long, strange little
narrow waggons, in strings of six or eight, bringing cheese from
Switzerland, and frequently in charge, the whole line, of one man, or
even boy—and he very often asleep in the foremost cart—come jingling
past: the horses drowsily ringing the bells upon their harness, and
looking as if they thought (no doubt they do) their great blue woolly
furniture, of immense weight and thickness, with a pair of grotesque
horns growing out of the collar, very much too warm for the Midsummer
weather.

We are invited to dine, and seek to ascertain the profit and loss of
the invitation by inquiries of a fellow _convive_ as to the guests
who will be there: he is _l'ami de la maison_, and, to give due
emphasis to the description, and honour to the Amphitryon, he thus
enumerates them. "Oh, you'll have the Mortimer Bullwinkles, Mr. and
Mrs. Frederick Cutbush, the Stafford Priddys, Sir Montague Stumps, Mr.
Temple Sniggers, the Beauchamp Horrockses, and Mrs. Courtenay Cocking;
nobody else, that I remember." "Won't the Wartons be there?" "I don't
know,--who are they?--I never heard of them:--what's their _other_
name?"

‘Certainly she did. Next morning, and next evening too; but always when
there were no people about, and always alone. I rose earlier and sat
there later, that when she came, she might find the church door open,
and the organ playing, and might not be disappointed. She strolled that
way for some days, and always stayed to listen. But she is gone now,
and of all unlikely things in this wide world, it is perhaps the most
improbable that I shall ever look upon her face again.’

His consternation of surprise was so genuine, that the old man, with all
the disposition that he clearly entertained to believe it assumed, was
convinced of its reality.

He thought of her, as she had been that night when he and his bride
came home. He thought of her as she had been, in all the home-events of
the abandoned house. He thought, now, that of all around him, she alone
had never changed. His boy had faded into dust, his proud wife had sunk
into a polluted creature, his flatterer and friend had been transformed
into the worst of villains, his riches had melted away, the very walls
that sheltered him looked on him as a stranger; she alone had turned
the same mild gentle look upon him always. Yes, to the latest and the
last. She had never changed to him—nor had he ever changed to her—and
she was lost.

It was now night, and as they came nearer to the city they had dismal
confirmation of this intelligence in three great fires, all close
together, which burnt fiercely and were gloomily reflected in the sky.
Arriving in the immediate suburbs, they found that almost every house
had chalked upon its door in large characters ‘No Popery,’ that the
shops were shut, and that alarm and anxiety were depicted in every face
they passed.

An opportunity for realising his fondest anticipations, soon presented
itself. Rumours were rife on the hackney-coach stands, that a buss was
building, to run from Lisson-grove to the Bank, down Oxford-street and
Holborn; and the rapid increase of busses on the Paddington-road,
encouraged the idea. Mr. Barker secretly and cautiously inquired in the
proper quarters. The report was correct; the ‘Royal William’ was to
make its first journey on the following Monday. It was a crack affair
altogether. An enterprising young cabman, of established reputation as
a dashing whip—for he had compromised with the parents of three
scrunched children, and just ‘worked out’ his fine for knocking down an
old lady—was the driver; and the spirited proprietor, knowing Mr.
Barker’s qualifications, appointed him to the vacant office of cad on
the very first application. The buss began to run, and Mr. Barker
entered into a new suit of clothes, and on a new sphere of action.

“It’s as dark as the grave,” said the man, groping forward a few steps.
“Make haste!”

Mrs. Snitchey cut this reference very short by hitching her husband to a
distance, and asking him to look at that man.  To do her the favour to
look at him!

This last ejaculation, with which Miss Nipper frequently wound up a
sentence, at about that epoch of time, was supposed below the level of
the hall to have a general reference to Mr Dombey, and to be expressive
of a yearning in Miss Nipper to favour that gentleman with a piece of
her mind. But she never explained it; and it had, in consequence, the
charm of mystery, in addition to the advantage of the sharpest
expression.

“This here blessed day, my lady lass,” replied the Captain.

AN ENLIGHTENED CLERGYMAN

The times are grown degenerate; brigandage is no longer a profession;
bandits, like the Mohicans, are become extinct, and from Terracina to
Forli, travellers have now-a-days no chance of meeting with a Paolo
Ucelli, a Fiesole Ogagna, a De Cesaris, or a Barbone. I remember
traversing that tract at a period when I expected every moment to see
some of these freebooters in their picturesque costume peep from behind
every projecting rock. Civilization and morality have stifled all
sentiment;--the Neapolitan frontier is become a Salvator Rosa without
its figures.

The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the
little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver
had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.

The king and his proud ladye,
      Were they pacing that high hall,
    With crowns of gold, and girded
      In purple and in pall?

P.S.--I have forgotten something. I suggest this title: "Knowing the
World; or, Not So Bad As We Seem."

"Which?" said Sam.

‘Well, he wasn’t there at all,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘until he came up behind
her, and whispered. Then she turned round and fainted, and I stood still
and looked at him, and he walked away; but that he should have
been hiding ever since (in the ground or somewhere), is the most
extraordinary thing!’

‘It is natural, Alfred,’ she said, looking up with some timidity into
his face, ‘to think in such an emergency of the richest people we know,
and the simplest.’

How often did the great house, and the old days, come before her in the
twilight time, when she was sheltered by the arm, so proud, so fond,
and, creeping closer to him, shrunk within it at the recollection! How
often, from remembering the night when she went down to that room and
met the never-to-be forgotten look, did she raise her eyes to those
that watched her with such loving earnestness, and weep with happiness
in such a refuge! The more she clung to it, the more the dear dead
child was in her thoughts: but as if the last time she had seen her
father, had been when he was sleeping and she kissed his face, she
always left him so, and never, in her fancy, passed that hour.

“After recovering from the shock of a piece of news of my dear boy, so
entirely unexpected, and so destructive of all the castles I had built
for him; and after having had time to think of it; yes.”

"Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch.

The excitement of the late election has subsided, and our parish being
once again restored to a state of comparative tranquillity, we are
enabled to devote our attention to those parishioners who take little
share in our party contests or in the turmoil and bustle of public
life. And we feel sincere pleasure in acknowledging here, that in
collecting materials for this task we have been greatly assisted by Mr.
Bung himself, who has imposed on us a debt of obligation which we fear
we can never repay. The life of this gentleman has been one of a very
chequered description: he has undergone transitions—not from grave to
gay, for he never was grave—not from lively to severe, for severity
forms no part of his disposition; his fluctuations have been between
poverty in the extreme, and poverty modified, or, to use his own
emphatic language, ‘between nothing to eat and just half enough.’ He is
not, as he forcibly remarks, ‘one of those fortunate men who, if they
were to dive under one side of a barge stark-naked, would come up on
the other with a new suit of clothes on, and a ticket for soup in the
waistcoat-pocket:’ neither is he one of those, whose spirit has been
broken beyond redemption by misfortune and want. He is just one of the
careless, good-for-nothing, happy fellows, who float, cork-like, on the
surface, for the world to play at hockey with: knocked here, and there,
and everywhere: now to the right, then to the left, again up in the
air, and anon to the bottom, but always reappearing and bounding with
the stream buoyantly and merrily along. Some few months before he was
prevailed upon to stand a contested election for the office of beadle,
necessity attached him to the service of a broker; and on the
opportunities he here acquired of ascertaining the condition of most of
the poorer inhabitants of the parish, his patron, the captain, first
grounded his claims to public support. Chance threw the man in our way
a short time since. We were, in the first instance, attracted by his
prepossessing impudence at the election; we were not surprised, on
further acquaintance, to find him a shrewd, knowing fellow, with no
inconsiderable power of observation; and, after conversing with him a
little, were somewhat struck (as we dare say our readers have
frequently been in other cases) with the power some men seem to have,
not only of sympathising with, but to all appearance of understanding
feelings to which they themselves are entire strangers. We had been
expressing to the new functionary our surprise that he should ever have
served in the capacity to which we have just adverted, when we
gradually led him into one or two professional anecdotes. As we are
induced to think, on reflection, that they will tell better in nearly
his own words, than with any attempted embellishments of ours, we will
at once entitle them.

Some recollection of his trembling from head to foot, as if with
excessive cold, and of his bursting into tears, was all that Walter
could add to this, when he tried to recall exactly what had passed
between them.

Mr. Swiveller, it must be said had been at one time somewhat in love
with a young lady: but she had left his love and married a Mr. Cheggs.

"Mr. Scrooge?"

It is not to be supposed that he took in everything at one glance, for
he had as yet been unconscious of the presence of a sick man propped up
with pillows in an easy-chair, who, moving restlessly and impatiently in
his seat, attracted his attention.

“My child!” said the elder lady, folding her arms about her, “I never
saw you thus before.”

‘Well!’ said the colonel; ‘then we got it all from the old country, and
the old country’s to blame for it, and not the new ‘un. There’s an end
of THAT. Now, if Mr Jefferson Brick and you will be so good as to clear,
I’ll come out last, and lock the door.’

At first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in remaining
up there by himself.  Yielding at length, if any concession so sullenly
made can be called yielding, to the entreaties of Sissy—for Louisa he
disowned altogether—he came down, bench by bench, until he stood in the
sawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible, within its
limits from where his father sat.

A few days have elapsed, and a stately ship is out at sea, spreading
its white wings to the favouring wind.

After breakfast, Boots is inclined to consider that they drawed
soldiers,--at least, he knows that many such was found in the fire-place,
all on horseback.  In the course of the morning, Master Harry rang the
bell,--it was surprising how that there boy did carry on,--and said, in a
sprightly way, "Cobbs, is there any good walks in this neighbourhood?"

‘And with too good reason,’ added Mrs. Weller gravely.

After examining his chamber, and looking under the bed, and in the
cupboards, and even behind the curtains, with unusual caution (although
it was, as has been said, broad day), he double-locked the door by which
he had entered, and retired to rest. There was another door in the
room, but it was locked on the outer side; and with what place it
communicated, he knew not.

‘Why, sir,’ returned Brass, ‘he--dear me, Mr Quilp, sir--’

"Mr. Dick," said my aunt, "what shall I do with this child?"

"Well," I said to him, with an irony that unconsciously mimicked
his own, "have you taken advice with your nurse?  I assume that the
dark form by your side is that of Ayesha!"*

On this same day, and about this very hour, Mr Willet the elder sat
smoking his pipe in a chamber at the Black Lion. Although it was hot
summer weather, Mr Willet sat close to the fire. He was in a state of
profound cogitation, with his own thoughts, and it was his custom
at such times to stew himself slowly, under the impression that that
process of cookery was favourable to the melting out of his ideas,
which, when he began to simmer, sometimes oozed forth so copiously as to
astonish even himself.

"Come up here! Mr. Pickwick," said Mr. Wardle, "come along sir. Joe!
Drat that boy! He's gone to sleep again. Joe, let down the steps and
open the carriage door. Come ahead, room for two of you inside and one
outside. Joe, make room for one. Put this gentleman on the box!" Mr.
Wardle mounted with a little help and the fat boy, where he was, fell
fast asleep.

‘What!’ said Mrs Gamp, ‘you bage creetur, have I know’d Mrs Harris five
and thirty year, to be told at last that there ain’t no sech a person
livin’! Have I stood her friend in all her troubles, great and small,
for it to come at last to sech a end as this, which her own sweet picter
hanging up afore you all the time, to shame your Bragian words! But well
you mayn’t believe there’s no sech a creetur, for she wouldn’t demean
herself to look at you, and often has she said, when I have made mention
of your name, which, to my sinful sorrow, I have done, “What, Sairey
Gamp! debage yourself to HER!” Go along with you!’

“She shall know it,” I said, trembling suddenly from head to foot.

“By whom?”

“O, you _are_ out of it, Mr. Chops? How did you get out, sir?”

You should have seen the ruins of Covent Garden Theatre. I went in the
moment I got to London--four days after the fire. Although the audience
part and the stage were so tremendously burnt out that there was not a
piece of wood half the size of a lucifer-match for the eye to rest on,
though nothing whatever remained but bricks and smelted iron lying on a
great black desert, the theatre still looked so wonderfully like its
old self grown gigantic that I never saw so strange a sight. The wall
dividing the front from the stage still remained, and the iron
pass-doors stood ajar in an impossible and inaccessible frame. The
arches that supported the stage were there, and the arches that
supported the pit; and in the centre of the latter lay something like a
Titanic grape-vine that a hurricane had pulled up by the roots, twisted,
and flung down there; this was the great chandelier. Gye had kept the
men's wardrobe at the top of the house over the great entrance
staircase; when the roof fell in it came down bodily, and all that part
of the ruins was like an old Babylonic pavement, bright rays tesselating
the black ground, sometimes in pieces so large that I could make out the
clothes in the "Trovatore."

So they both stood at the stair-head with a pair of office-candles,
watching him down; and when he had gone away, stood looking at each
other.

‘Less than justice to Mr Boffin, Sophronia,’ said Mr Lammle, soaring
into a tone of moral grandeur, ‘because it represents Mr Boffin as on my
lower level; more than justice to me, Sophronia, because it represents
me as on Mr Boffin’s higher level. Mr Boffin bears and forbears far more
than I could.’

‘Come off!’ said Sam.

‘GRIDE.

Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his
half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of
the spoon grating against the saucepan’s sides: and yet the self-same
senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with
almost everybody he had ever known.

The Carrier advanced to seize him by the hand; but, recoiling, as some
feature in his face awakened a remembrance of the Deaf Man in the Cart,
said:

‘Now, Dora, my love,’ I returned, gently trying to remove the
handkerchief she pressed to her eyes, ‘this is not only very ridiculous
of you, but very wrong. In the first place, it’s not true.’

As they proceeded further on their track, and came more and more towards
their journey’s end, the monotonous desolation of the scene increased to
that degree, that for any redeeming feature it presented to their eyes,
they might have entered, in the body, on the grim domains of Giant
Despair. A flat morass, bestrewn with fallen timber; a marsh on which
the good growth of the earth seemed to have been wrecked and cast away,
that from its decomposing ashes vile and ugly things might rise; where
the very trees took the aspect of huge weeds, begotten of the slime
from which they sprung, by the hot sun that burnt them up; where fatal
maladies, seeking whom they might infect, came forth at night in misty
shapes, and creeping out upon the water, hunted them like spectres until
day; where even the blessed sun, shining down on festering elements
of corruption and disease, became a horror; this was the realm of Hope
through which they moved.

‘Come, come,’ said Nicholas, ‘I am all impatience to begin.’

“Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”

The old man lifted up his eyes once more to the little eyes in Mr
Fledgeby’s head, with some reviving hope that the sign might be coming
yet.

"Walk in, Injun," said Jeff, hospitably. "Yer clo'es ain't quite ready,
but the woman will hev 'em all up soon--walk in."

“My dear sir,” Grandfather Smallweed then proceeds, addressing Mr.
Guppy, “there has been a calamity here. Have you heard of it, either
of you?”

‘Mr Rokesmith,’ said she, resignedly, ‘has been so polite as to place
his sitting-room at our disposal to-day. You will therefore, Bella, be
entertained in the humble abode of your parents, so far in accordance
with your present style of living, that there will be a drawing-room for
your reception as well as a dining-room. Your papa invited Mr Rokesmith
to partake of our lowly fare. In excusing himself on account of a
particular engagement, he offered the use of his apartment.’

WASHINGTON, _February 5th, 1868._

But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a
passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and
manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had
lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had
made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence
from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said
that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted
assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,
and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he
cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,
and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,
whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and
silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to
Wemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle
heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the
innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to
represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be
more open with me!”

“If you believe you are a good prophet,” said I.

Charleroi, 20, 112.

‘I’ll drag him from it,’ cried Nicholas.

In the morning a white squall came on, and was succeeded by other squalls
of various colours.  It thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks.
Hurricanes then set in for two months.  Waterspouts and tornadoes
followed.  The oldest sailor on board—and he was a very old one—had never
seen such weather.  ‘The Beauty’ lost all idea where she was, and the
carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold.  Everybody fell
senseless at the pumps every day.

MY DEAR OWEN,

"Impossible, aunt! And even if--even supposing--no, aunt, you are
certainly----"

‘We don’t know,’ said Mr. Tupman, answering this mute appeal aloud. ‘He
has been much excited for two days past, and his whole demeanour very
unlike what it usually is. We feared there must be something the matter,
but he resolutely denies it.’

Mr Arthur Clennam sat in the window of the coffee-house on Ludgate Hill,
counting one of the neighbouring bells, making sentences and burdens of
songs out of it in spite of himself, and wondering how many sick
people it might be the death of in the course of the year. As the hour
approached, its changes of measure made it more and more exasperating.
At the quarter, it went off into a condition of deadly-lively
importunity, urging the populace in a voluble manner to Come to church,
Come to church, Come to church! At the ten minutes, it became aware
that the congregation would be scanty, and slowly hammered out in low
spirits, They _won’t_ come, they _won’t_ come, they _won’t_ come! At the
five minutes, it abandoned hope, and shook every house in the
neighbourhood for three hundred seconds, with one dismal swing per
second, as a groan of despair.

Beyond devising that very artful and politic measure of leaving a card
for Mr Dombey daily, the brain of Mr Toots had not worked much in
reference to the subject that held his feelings prisoner. But deep
consideration at length assured Mr Toots that an important step to
gain, was, the conciliation of Miss Susan Nipper, preparatory to giving
her some inkling of his state of mind.

MY DEAR BULWER LYTTON,

‘Miss Nell!’ said the boy in a low voice.

‘It is much to be regretted,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more
Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity,
‘that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.’

Nineteenth Day.

For some months past, Becky had believed without a doubt, that the day
of her return home would be the very happiest day of her life. She was
too young to know yet that it is not for us to settle which of our days
shall be happy ones, nor what events shall yield us joy. The promise had
not been kept that she should return when her father and mother removed
into the new cottage. She had been told that there really was not, even
now, decent room for them all; and that they must at least wait till the
hot weather was completely over before they crowded the chamber, as they
had hitherto done. And then, when autumn came on, and the creeping mists
from the low grounds hung round the place from sunset till after
breakfast the next day, the mother delayed sending for her daughter,
unwilling that she should lose the look of health which she alone now,
of all the family, exhibited. Fleming and his wife and babe prospered
better than the others. The young man’s business lay on the high ground,
at the top of the embankment. He was there all day while Mr. Woodruffe
and Allan were below, among the ditches and the late and early fogs.
Mrs. Fleming was young and strong, full of spirit and happiness; and so
far fortified against the attacks of disease, as a merry heart
strengthens nerve and bone and muscle, and invigorates all the vital
powers. In regard to her family, her father’s hopeful spirit seemed to
have passed into her. While he was becoming permanently discouraged, she
was always assured that everything would come right next year. The time
had arrived for her power of hope to be tested to the utmost. One day
this autumn, she admitted that Becky must be sent for. She did not
forget, however, to charge Allan to be cheerful, and make the best of
things, and not frighten Becky by the way.

The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.

“Oh!” said he, coming back. “And is that your father alonger your
mother?”

The prisoner answered with a sullen nod; and being left alone again, sat
brooding over what he had heard, and pondering upon the hopes the recent
conversation had awakened; gazing abstractedly, the while he did so,
on the light without, and watching the shadows thrown by one wall on
another, and on the stone-paved ground.

It appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles backed his Twenty
Eight against Mr. Creakle’s Twenty Seven, for each of them took his own
man in hand.

The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was
making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate
dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.

‘Who’s he?’ asked Steerforth, in his careless way.

LITTLE DORRIT.

“There are a small bed with silk curtains, two satin quilts, and no
blanket; a hair mattress; a plain wicker basket stands on a table, with
a silk night-gown and night-cap in it; a candle with an extinguisher;
some billets of wood on each side of the fire. He goes to bed alone,
rises, lights his fire, and tends it himself, and nobody knows when he
rises, which is very early, and he is up several hours before he calls
anybody. He dines in a small room adjoining, in which there is nothing
but very common things. He sometimes, they say, sups with his daughters
and their company, and is very merry, and sings French songs; but at
present he is in low spirits.”

Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.
Grimwig the most exquisite delight.

"I was present under Dumouriez at Valmy, where the allies, as if
panic-stricken, showed the futility of their threats, for we were
victorious. Conquest succeeded to conquest. The battle of Jemmapes
was fought, and Belgium became ours. It was whilst prosecuting a
hazardous march that intelligence reached me that Louis was no more.
Madame T----'s revenge was satiated; but she herself perished near
the guillotine, an awful instance of fearful retribution. She had
hurried in disguise to the place of slaughter, and obtained a near
approach to the fatal instrument. Her joy at seeing the axe fall was
unbounded; she shrieked with delight, and, being recognised, was raised
upon the shoulders of the women, and in the madness of the moment was
worshipped with enthusiastic fervour: they bore her along through
the swelling crowds, and, amidst their awe and homage, she cried for
fresh victims,--'The queen! the queen!' Her shout was reiterated by
the mob, in whom the sight of royal blood had quickened the tiger-like
ferocity of their sanguinary thirst for gore; and they were hurrying
towards the prison of the bereaved wife and wretched mother, when a
_garde du corps_, in female attire, fought his way to the head of the
procession. He, too, had witnessed the murder of his royal master; and,
terror for his own fate inspiring him with a desire to fall at once,
he formed the determination to have a companion in his exit. He stood
before the shouting mob, who were compelling every one to do obeisance
to their idol; he stooped down, as if in obedience to their mandate;
but, making a sudden spring, like the panther from his lair, or the
snake from his coil, he gripped the sibyl by the throat, dragged her to
the earth, and stabbed her to the heart! 'Twas the work of an instant;
the sound of her voice had scarcely died away in the distance as she
stirred up the vindictiveness of the populace, when she lay extended
on the frost-bound ground a lifeless corpse. The _garde du corps_
was instantly seized, and in a short time his dissevered limbs were
scattered through the Place Louis Quinze. Thus terminated the life of
Madame T----, and the queen was spared a little longer.

"Can't say," replied Guguste, tilting the soup-tureen to transfer the
last drop of warm salt-water to his own plate.

"Yes, Faddle, marriage."

"'It is not meet,'" said Mr. Micawber, rising, "'that every nice offence
should bear its comment!' Emma, I stand reproved."

‘Called him Lovely,’ said the other gentleman. ‘Said the Dog was the
perfect picture of the old aunt from whom he had expectations. Found him
particularly like her when hocussed.’

‘I wish you’d get breakfast, Mark, instead of worrying with people who
don’t belong to you,’ observed Martin, petulantly.

"Look at my sober, plodding husband there," returned Dot. "He adds
twenty years to my age at least. Don't you, John?"

‘Something in the yard,’ replied the stranger. Mr. Smithie bowed
deferentially to Sir Thomas Clubber; and Sir Thomas Clubber acknowledged
the salute with conscious condescension. Lady Clubber took a telescopic
view of Mrs. Smithie and family through her eye-glass and Mrs. Smithie
stared in her turn at Mrs. Somebody-else, whose husband was not in the
dockyard at all.

The object of her regret was not long in coming to her, for the news
soon spread over the house that Susan Nipper had had a disturbance with
Mrs Pipchin, and that they had both appealed to Mr Dombey, and that
there had been an unprecedented piece of work in Mr Dombey’s room, and
that Susan was going. The latter part of this confused rumour, Florence
found to be so correct, that Susan had locked the last trunk and was
sitting upon it with her bonnet on, when she came into her room.

"I'm sure, Mr. Bumble, that I was only a-telling one or two of the dear
children as is so fond of you, that it was you a-coming," replied Mrs.
Mann with great humility.

The King made her a shy bow.

"Now, Winkle," cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that there was
anything the matter. "Come; the ladies are all anxiety."

CHAPTER XXXVIII.     HOW MR. WINKLE, WHEN HE STEPPED OUT OF THE FRYING-
PAN

‘Thanks to your worthy governor, Sir,’ said Mr. Trotter, ‘we have half a
leg of mutton, baked, at a quarter before three, with the potatoes under
it to save boiling.’

Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear, it would not amaze
       me,
     Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd, it would not
       astonish me.

"Eh!" said Squeers, looking up.  "Oh! it's you, is it?"

The hungry-looking Jinks sighed, as if he were quite aware of the fact
of his having very little indeed to be merry about; and, being ordered
to take the lady’s information, shambled to a seat, and proceeded to
write it down.

_Sidney Smith_

On the tip-top of Gad's Hill, between this and Rochester, on the very
spot where Falstaff ran away, I have a pretty little old-fashioned
house, which I shall live in the hope of showing to you one day. Also I
have a little story respecting the manner in which it became mine, which
I hope (on the same occasion in the clouds) to tell you. Until then and
always, I am, dear Lord Carlisle,

"I am looking at the likeness of the face," interrupted Mr. Peggotty,
with a steady but a kindling eye, "that has looked at me, in my home, at
my fireside, in my boat--wheer not?--smiling and friendly, when it was
so treacherous, that I go half wild when I think of it. If the likeness
of that face don't turn to burning fire, at the thought of offering
money to me for my child's blight and ruin, it's as bad. I doen't know,
being a lady's, but what it's worse."

"Your wash-up," stammered Grummer, "I----"

"Much obliged to you, Peggotty," returned my mother, in a cheerful
voice, "I have had a _very_ pleasant evening."

‘You do it so well,’ tittered Miss Squeers, ‘that it would be a pity to
interrupt, wouldn’t it, Mr. Browdie? He! he! he!’

‘A light in the passage,’ said Quilp, peeping through the keyhole.  ‘A
very soft knock; and, by your leave, my lady, I may yet steal upon you
unawares.  Soho!’

A hesitating double knock at the street-door, heard during a momentary
pause in the conversation, excites a general inquiry of ‘Who’s that?’
and two or three children, who have been standing at the window,
announce in a low voice, that it’s ‘poor aunt Margaret.’ Upon which,
aunt George leaves the room to welcome the new-comer; and grandmamma
draws herself up, rather stiff and stately; for Margaret married a poor
man without her consent, and poverty not being a sufficiently weighty
punishment for her offence, has been discarded by her friends, and
debarred the society of her dearest relatives. But Christmas has come
round, and the unkind feelings that have struggled against better
dispositions during the year, have melted away before its genial
influence, like half-formed ice beneath the morning sun. It is not
difficult in a moment of angry feeling for a parent to denounce a
disobedient child; but, to banish her at a period of general good-will
and hilarity, from the hearth, round which she has sat on so many
anniversaries of the same day, expanding by slow degrees from infancy
to girlhood, and then bursting, almost imperceptibly, into a woman, is
widely different. The air of conscious rectitude, and cold forgiveness,
which the old lady has assumed, sits ill upon her; and when the poor
girl is led in by her sister, pale in looks and broken in hope—not from
poverty, for that she could bear, but from the consciousness of
undeserved neglect, and unmerited unkindness—it is easy to see how much
of it is assumed. A momentary pause succeeds; the girl breaks suddenly
from her sister and throws herself, sobbing, on her mother’s neck. The
father steps hastily forward, and takes her husband’s hand. Friends
crowd round to offer their hearty congratulations, and happiness and
harmony again prevail.

‘Nobody I know!’ cried Sir Mulberry Hawk, advancing to the astonished
lady. ‘Is this Mrs. Nickleby--the mother of Miss Nickleby--the delightful
creature that I had the happiness of meeting in this house the very last
time I dined here? But no;’ said Sir Mulberry, stopping short. ‘No, it
can’t be. There is the same cast of features, the same indescribable air
of--But no; no. This lady is too young for that.’

They stopped before its low arched door.  After trying several of the
keys in vain, the schoolmaster found one to fit the huge lock, which
turned back, creaking, and admitted them into the house.

It would be a good advance from my present situation, and would doubtless
prove a stepping-stone to other and better appointments; but I had a
mother living at Fazeley, bedridden and paralytic, who had no pleasure in
existence except having me to dwell under the same roof with her.  My
head was growing more and more dizzy, and a strange vagueness was
creeping over me.

“You don’t expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the
sovereign, do you?” says the constable, eyeing him aside with
ineffable disdain.

“You are welcome to all the rushes you can find,” said Woodruffe; “but
where is your son?”

"Why do you doubt your senses?"

They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which
might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons
from the rain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband
carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and
trudged on, a few paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to
give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They
went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed
his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate
was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels,
he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable
increase of speed, towards their place of destination.

He had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and stopped
him for a moment, entreating him not to beat me. It was only a moment
that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards, and in
the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth,
between my teeth, and bit it through. It sets my teeth on edge to think
of it.

ANASTATIA (a pretty girl, in a bright Garibaldi, this morning elected by
universal suffrage the Beauty of the Ship).  That is me, sir.

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

“Only to ask a question,” said the other, pointing to the scrap of
paper. “What name am I to ask for?”

Chapter 31

‘Still, he may do what he likes.’

The recollection of those incidents, and his own share in them, may
have been made the more captivating, perhaps, by the weekly dreamings
of old Sol and Captain Cuttle on Sundays. Hardly a Sunday passed,
without mysterious references being made by one or other of those
worthy chums to Richard Whittington; and the latter gentleman had even
gone so far as to purchase a ballad of considerable antiquity, that had
long fluttered among many others, chiefly expressive of maritime
sentiments, on a dead wall in the Commercial Road: which poetical
performance set forth the courtship and nuptials of a promising young
coal-whipper with a certain “lovely Peg,” the accomplished daughter of
the master and part-owner of a Newcastle collier. In this stirring
legend, Captain Cuttle descried a profound metaphysical bearing on the
case of Walter and Florence; and it excited him so much, that on very
festive occasions, as birthdays and a few other non-Dominical holidays,
he would roar through the whole song in the little back parlour; making
an amazing shake on the word Pe-e-eg, with which every verse concluded,
in compliment to the heroine of the piece.

The young spectre was dressed in an obsolete fashion: or rather, was not
so much dressed as put into a case of inferior pepper-and-salt cloth,
made horrible by means of shining buttons.  I observed that these buttons
went, in a double row, over each shoulder of the young ghost, and
appeared to descend his back.  He wore a frill round his neck.  His right
hand (which I distinctly noticed to be inky) was laid upon his stomach;
connecting this action with some feeble pimples on his countenance, and
his general air of nausea, I concluded this ghost to be the ghost of a
boy who had habitually taken a great deal too much medicine.

‘Encourage him, my dear?’ said her sister, smiling contemptuously, ‘that
depends upon what you call encourage. No, I don’t mean to encourage him.
But I’ll make a slave of him.’

“By heaven!” cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in
the subject—though I need not say that, for he could do nothing
weakly; “I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry
devoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there is
in it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary
task-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that
illustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is base
and despicable,” cried Mr. Boythorn, “the treatment of surgeons
aboard ship is such that I would submit the legs—both legs—of every
member of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a
transportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if
the system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!”

LII      FAGIN’S LAST NIGHT ALIVE

The child saw with astonishment and alarm that his whole appearance had
undergone a complete change.  His face was flushed and eager, his eyes
were strained, his teeth set, his breath came short and thick, and the
hand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that she shook beneath
its grasp.

[Illustration: "DOST KNOW THE NAME OF YON SHIP, MAYOR?"]

The tremendous sea itself, when I could find sufficient pause to look at
it, in the agitation of the blinding wind, the flying stones and sand,
and the awful noise, confounded me. As the high watery walls came
rolling in, and, at their highest, tumbled into surf, they looked as if
the least would engulf the town. As the receding wave swept back with a
hoarse roar, it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach, as if its
purpose were to undermine the earth. When some white-headed billows
thundered on, and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the
land, every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full
might of its wrath, rushing to be gathered to the composition of another
monster. Undulating hills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys
(with a solitary storm-bird sometimes skimming through them) were lifted
up to hills; masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming
sound; every shape tumultuously rolled on, as soon as made, to change
its shape and place, and beat another shape and place away; the ideal
shore on the horizon, with its towers and buildings, rose and fell; the
clouds fell fast and thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of
all nature.

This was in the year 1836; and the horror it excited in the race of
horses, native and foreign, inhabitants of the British empire, is not
to be described. A knowledge of the habits and intelligence of this
species is only to be obtained from the writings of our matter-of-fact
and lamented predecessor, Captain Lemuel Gulliver, whose travels among
the Houyhnhnms, rather more than a century ago, may have been heard
of by a few of our antiquarian and classical readers. To that work we
would refer, to show that Houyhnhnm is "the perfection of nature;" which
truth will partly account for the following melancholy narrative. "I
admired" (the author writes) "the strength, comeliness, and speed of
the inhabitants; and such a constellation of virtues in such amiable
persons, produced in me the highest veneration."

He instantly arose, and taking the latter aside, whispered a few words
to him, and then, having accomplished his object, which was to prevent
any communication between him and Mr. Jukes, told the clergyman to
proceed with the ceremony.

‘True,’ said Jingle, nodding his head. ‘Pawnbroker’s shop--duplicates
here--small sums--mere nothing--all rascals.’

A tray was brought with everything upon it, even to the cucumber and
Mrs Gamp accordingly sat down to eat and drink in high good humour. The
extent to which she availed herself of the vinegar, and supped up that
refreshing fluid with the blade of her knife, can scarcely be expressed
in narrative.

“Oh, yes!” rejoined the matron, with enthusiasm; “so fond of their home
too, that it’s quite a pleasure, I’m sure.”

But as he would on no account accept this offer, she took a graceful
leave of Ada—none of me—and put her hand upon his proffered arm,
and got into the carriage, which was a little, low, park carriage
with a hood.

‘But this person,’ urged Kate.

‘You that keep this house,’ said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit,
‘do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is
over?’

The eyes, which have been darkly fixed upon the sky, turn with meaning
in them towards the compassionate face from which the tears are
dropping, and a smile is on the aged lips as they ask:

"Oh!" said Mr. Pecksniff, "here is the young man. _He_ will take the
card. With my compliments, if you please, young man. My dears, we are
interrupting the studies. Let us go."

Miss Sally pulled out the tin snuff-box, and took a long, slow pinch,
regarding her brother with a steady gaze all the time.

In walking from the city with his sentimental friend, Tom Pinch had
looked into the face, and brushed against the threadbare sleeve, of Mr
Nadgett, man of mystery to the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and
Life Assurance Company. Mr Nadgett naturally passed away from Tom’s
remembrance as he passed out of his view; for he didn’t know him, and
had never heard his name.

As the announcement was vague, though very peremptory, Little Dorrit
returned, ‘Let us talk about it.’

‘The licence,’ repeated Mr. Jingle--

"Why, ma'am," said he, "to say truth, I have come forty miles since
dinner, and don't care if I have a little of both. I'll begin, if you
please, with that there, (Lord bless its claws, they're as red as your
lips!) and we'll astonish a few of the natives afterwards, _by_ your
leave."

VOLUME THE SECOND

‘I’m sure she must have been.  Why, only think how old she looked.  You
and I seemed but boys to her.’

The quarters of our soldiers at Niagara, are finely and airily situated.
Some of them are large detached houses on the plain above the Falls,
which were originally designed for hotels; and in the evening time, when
the women and children were leaning over the balconies watching the men
as they played at ball and other games upon the grass before the door,
they often presented a little picture of cheerfulness and animation which
made it quite a pleasure to pass that way.

“Tops!” cried the mild man, rising in public estimation every Instant.

It was past eleven o’clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly
on its hinges as the Jew gave a low whistle. They entered without
noise, and the door was closed behind them.

The snow fell fast and thick. He looked up for a moment in the air, and
thought that those white ashes strewn upon his hopes and misery, were
suited to them well. He looked round on the whitening ground, and
thought how Marion's foot-prints would be hushed and covered up, as soon
as made, and even that remembrance of her blotted out. But he never felt
the weather, and he never stirred.

For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence
of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and
mercy of the board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to
suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect
for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would
have established that sage individual’s prophetic character, once
and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook
in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance
of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that
pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for
all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the
express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and
pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater
obstacle in Oliver’s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly
all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little
hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in
the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and
tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to
feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and
loneliness which surrounded him.

CHAPTER 54

"If you please to give them to me."

‘Never was such luck,’ said Mr. Miller.

That was gone, and lo! before me,
A cathedral vast and grim;
I could almost hear the organ
Peal alone the arches dim.

‘She’s pretty well,’ replied Master Bardell, ‘so am I.’

The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs,
muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion;
being at length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light
into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the
more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman
lay.

“You have done nothing of the sort.”

‘Lauk, Mary Ann! what’s the matter?’ said Mrs. Cluppins.

Kate was about to thank him again, but he stopped her.

"But, Dora, my beloved!" said I, at last resuming it; "I was going to
mention something."

Mr Wegg presented his friend as Mr Venus.

The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head
for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve;
whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.

PICTURES FROM ITALY AND AMERICAN NOTES.

CRIME AND EDUCATION

‘Horrid murder in Westminster this morning,’ observed Mr. Bolton.

‘The wretched man who has been murdered,’ Mr Chuzzlewit went on to say;
‘then passing by the name of--’

‘Why, I’ll tell you what, sir,’ said Tim, standing in his favourite
attitude and pointing to the cage with the feather of his pen, ‘it’s a
very extraordinary thing about that bird, that the only people he ever
takes the smallest notice of, are Mr. Charles, and Mr. Ned, and you, and
me.’

It was some gratification to Mr Quilp to find, as he took his place
upon the roof, that Kit’s mother was alone inside; from which
circumstance he derived in the course of the journey much cheerfulness
of spirit, inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify
her with many extraordinary annoyances; such as hanging over the side
of the coach at the risk of his life, and staring in with his great
goggle eyes, which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being
upside down; dodging her in this way from one window to another;
getting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head
in at the window with a dismal squint: which ingenious tortures had
such an effect upon Mrs Nubbles, that she was quite unable for the time
to resist the belief that Mr Quilp did in his own person represent and
embody that Evil Power, who was so vigorously attacked at Little
Bethel, and who, by reason of her backslidings in respect of Astley’s
and oysters, was now frolicsome and rampant.

"Oh yes. Traddles is a good fellow," returned my host, nodding his head
with an air of toleration. "Traddles is quite a good fellow."

It was between six and seven o’clock in the evening, when we drove to the
hotel: in front of which, and on the top of the broad flight of steps
leading to the door, two or three citizens were balancing themselves on
rocking-chairs, and smoking cigars.  We found it a very large and elegant
establishment, and were as well entertained as travellers need desire to
be.  The climate being a thirsty one, there was never, at any hour of the
day, a scarcity of loungers in the spacious bar, or a cessation of the
mixing of cool liquors: but they were a merrier people here, and had
musical instruments playing to them o’ nights, which it was a treat to
hear again.

‘They’re too big,’ grumbled Venus. ‘What’s a scratch here and a scrape
there, a poke in this place and a dig in the other, to them. Besides;
what have we found?’

‘For clearly do I know, mark you,’ pursued Wegg, pointing his words
with his forefinger, ‘clearly do I know what question your expressive
features puts to me.’

Of his being a thief and a glutton I shall say a few words anon; but
where does he cheat the weak or prey upon the poor,--where terrify the
timorous or insult the defenceless,--where is he obsequious; where
malignant,--where is he supercilious and haughty with common men,--where
does he think his interest of importance to the Duke of Lancaster?
Of this last charge I see nothing whatever in the play. The "Duke"
of Lancaster[92] is a slip of the Doctor's pen. But Falstaff nowhere
extends his patronage to Prince John; on the contrary, he asks from
the prince the favour of his good report to the king, adding, when he
is alone, that the sober-blooded boy did not love him. He is courteous
of manner; but, so far from being obsequious, he assumes the command
wherever he goes. He is jocularly satirical of speech; but he who has
attached to him so many jesting companions for such a series of years,
never could have been open to the reproach of malignity. If the sayings
of Johnson himself about Goldsmith and Garrick, for example, were
gathered, must he not have allowed them to be far more calculated to
hurt their feelings than anything Falstaff ever said of Poins or Hal?
and yet would he not recoil from the accusation of being actuated by
malignant feelings towards men whom, in spite of wayward conversations,
he honoured, admired, and loved?

“The elephants and lions and tigers?  O dear no!”

‘If you think, Steerforth,’ said Mr. Mell, ‘that I am not acquainted
with the power you can establish over any mind here’--he laid his hand,
without considering what he did (as I supposed), upon my head--‘or that
I have not observed you, within a few minutes, urging your juniors on to
every sort of outrage against me, you are mistaken.’

‘Halloa there!’ cried a voice from above.

‘Oh! I know plenty of fellows who’ll be delighted with the scheme,’
replied Mr. Percy Noakes; ‘of course we shall have—’

‘How do you know?’

‘Upon my soul,’ exclaimed the boy, ‘you are a nice picture of a sister!
Upon my soul, you are a pretty piece of disinterestedness! And so all my
endeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world, and to
raise you with me, are to be beaten down by YOUR low whims; are they?’

"Miss Witherfield," said Mr. Magnus, "allow me to introduce my very
particular friend, Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Pickwick, I beg to make you known
to Miss Witherfield."

‘I must request, sir,’ said Bella, taking refuge in a touch of timely
resentment, ‘that I may not be questioned. You must excuse me if I
decline to be cross-examined.’

"Where are they?" said Wardle, taking up a brace of birds which the
dogs had deposited at his feet. "Why, here they are."

Life is made of ever so many partings
          welded together.

There were few passengers astir; the street was sad and dismal, and
pretty well my own. A few stragglers from the theatres hurried by, and
now and then I turned aside to avoid some noisy drunkard as he reeled
homewards, but these interruptions were not frequent and soon ceased.
The clocks struck one. Still I paced up and down, promising myself that
every time should be the last, and breaking faith with myself on some
new plea as often as I did so.

The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these
transactions, and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying
round of life. Morning, noon, and night, morning, noon, and night, each
recurring with its accompanying monotony, always the same reluctant
return of the same sequences of machinery, like a dragging piece of
clockwork.

They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the
hour. With its first stroke his two conductors stopped, and turned
their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.

‘What! And giving up what was offered him here!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.

‘Not coldly,’ rejoined the old lady; ‘far from it.’

'And that other gentleman's Mr. Winkle, I think?' said Jackson.

“Well, now,” said the Statue, “’tis getting late, and, unaccustomed as I
am to conversational speaking, I must be brief. Were those the good old
times when Sanguinary Mary roasted bishops, and lighted the fires of
Smithfield? When Henry the Eighth, the British Bluebeard, cut his wives’
heads off, and burnt Catholic and Protestant at the same stake? When
Richard the Third smothered his nephews in the Tower? When the Wars of
the Roses deluged the land with blood? When Jack Cade marched upon
London? When we were, disgracefully driven out of France under Henry the
Sixth, or, as disgracefully, went marauding there, under Henry the
Fifth? Were the good old times those of Northumberland’s rebellion? Of
Richard the Second’s assassination? Of the battles, burnings, massacres,
cruel tormentings, and atrocities, which form the sum of the Plantagenet
reigns? Of John’s declaring himself the Pope’s vassal, and performing
dental operations on the Jews? Of the Forest Laws and Curfew under the
Norman kings? At what point of this series of bloody and cruel annals
will you place the times which you praise? Or do your good old times
extend over all that period when somebody or other was constantly
committing high treason, and there was a perpetual exhibition of heads
on London Bridge and Temple Bar?”

‘My head’s a bit light, and my feet are a bit heavy,’ said old Betty,
leaning her face drowsily on the breast of the woman who had spoken
before. ‘They’ll both come nat’ral in a minute. There’s nothing more the
matter.’

This most flattering salutation from a perfect stranger, would have
gratified us not a little as a token of his having held us in high
respect, and for that reason been desirous of our acquaintance, if we
had not suspected from the first, that the young gentleman, in making a
desperate effort to get through the ceremony of introduction, had, in
the bewilderment of his ideas, shaken hands with us at random. This
impression was fully confirmed by the subsequent behaviour of the
bashful young gentleman in question, which we noted particularly, with
the view of ascertaining whether we were right in our conjecture.

I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat, and the wind
came moaning on across the flat as it had done before. But I could not
help fancying, now, that it moaned of those who were gone; and instead
of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat
away, I thought of the sea that had risen, since I last heard those
sounds, and drowned my happy home. I recollect, as the wind and water
began to sound fainter in my ears, putting a short clause into my
prayers, petitioning that I might grow up to marry little Em’ly, and so
dropping lovingly asleep.

I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father, and
began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to anybody
else there. I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind to have it
out with Mr. Peggotty.

‘Then, he’s such a generous, fine, noble fellow,’ said I, quite carried
away by my favourite theme, ‘that it’s hardly possible to give him as
much praise as he deserves. I am sure I can never feel thankful enough
for the generosity with which he has protected me, so much younger and
lower in the school than himself.’

‘Well, Mr. Barkis?’

‘Pinch,’ said Mary.

Coward, can she reign and conquer
If we thus her glory dim?
Let us fight for her as nobly
As our fathers fought for him.
God, who crowns the dying ages,
Bids her rule, and us obey--
Bids us cast our lives before her,
Bids us serve the great To-day.

The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a
powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green
coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried
a smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the
stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were
in his elbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that
he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his
abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor
the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was
reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the
bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and
going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.

“‘And begs,’” said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, “‘to inform him, in
reference to his letter of inquiry on the African project—’ No,
Peepy! Not on my account!”

‘Drive slowly anywhere,’ Mrs Lammle called to her coachman, ‘and don’t
let the carriage rattle.’

“Major,” says Mr Dombey, “I assure you that I am really obliged to you.
I had no idea of checking your too partial friendship.”

‘Because it is the text of the little I have left to say. Observe! There
are no threats in it. If I utter a threat, stop me, and fasten it upon
me. Mr Eugene Wrayburn.’

"It was true; I did know; and she knew that I knew it.  To my shame
be it said that I was weak enough to yield to an equivocation which
I now see to have been disloyal, but which I then pretended to have
been no more than delicacy to Ottilie.  As, in point of fact, there
had never been a word passed between us respecting our mutual
feelings, I considered myself bound in honor to assume that there
was nothing tacitly acknowledged.

‘Has Miss Dartle sent you for me?’ I inquired.

‘The President begged to call the learned gentleman to order.

Ever faithfully.

Thus invited, Mr. Chadband steps forth, and after a little sleek
smiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of his hands,
delivers himself as follows, “My friends, we are now—Rachael, my
wife, and I—in the mansions of the rich and great. Why are we now in
the mansions of the rich and great, my friends? Is it because we are
invited? Because we are bidden to feast with them, because we are
bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play the lute
with them, because we are bidden to dance with them? No. Then why are
we here, my friends? Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and do
we require corn, and wine, and oil, or what is much the same thing,
money, for the keeping thereof? Probably so, my friends.”

‘Again. Tell it again!’ cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes,
and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his
lips.

"Wanted!" said Mr. Winkle, hastily jumping out of bed, and putting on a
few articles of clothing; "wanted! at this distance from town--who on
earth can want me?"

“Thank you, Guppy,” says Mr. Jobling. “I really don’t know but what I
WILL take summer cabbage.”

As Tregarthen only answered, "Please to go on," the captain recounted,
very tersely and plainly, the nature of Clissold's wanderings on the
barren island, as he had condensed them in his mind from the seafaring
man.  Tregarthen became greatly agitated during this recital, and at
length exclaimed,--

“She is indeed, miss,” answered Charley, peeping. “Still looking up
at the window.”

The unlucky gentleman continuing to rock himself to and fro, and to
utter an occasional moan, Mr Venus besought him to bear up against his
reverses, and to take time to accustom himself to the thought of his new
position. But, his taking time was exactly the thing of all others that
Silas Wegg could not be induced to hear of. ‘Yes or no, and no half
measures!’ was the motto which that obdurate person many times repeated;
shaking his fist at Mr Boffin, and pegging his motto into the floor with
his wooden leg, in a threatening and alarming manner.

"I think I am, Trot."

‘Quite,’ rejoined Newman. ‘He had hardly read it when he was called
away. Its contents are known to nobody but himself and us.’

‘I should know her among a thousand.’

‘He had some conversation with the poor man.  Did he take him aside?’

Where’s the Earl of Warwick?—Here he is, Mr. Field!  Here’s the Earl of
Warwick, Mr. Field!—O there you are, my Lord.  Come for’ard.  There’s a
chest, sir, not to have a clean shirt on.  An’t it?  Take your hat off,
my Lord.  Why, I should be ashamed if I was you—and an Earl, too—to show
myself to a gentleman with my hat on!—The Earl of Warwick laughs and
uncovers.  All the company laugh.  One pickpocket, especially, laughs
with great enthusiasm.  O what a jolly game it is, when Mr. Field comes
down—and don’t want nobody!

‘One word!’ cried Ralph, foaming at the mouth.

"I beg to be allowed to convey, through you, my apologies to
     your excellent aunt for my late excitement. An explosion of a
     smouldering volcano long suppressed, was the result of an internal
     contest more easily conceived than described.

“Excuse me, Lady Dedlock, if I add a little more to hear.”

"In the name of wonder, Grimaldi," said this agreeable character, "what
are you doing here?"

‘Get out of his sight or I can’t hold the wild beast! Get out of the
room! By my soul, he’ll kill you!’

On farther consideration this appeared so likely, that I abandoned my
scheme, which had had a more promising appearance in words than in
action; resolving henceforth to be satisfied with my child-wife, and to
try to change her into nothing else by any process. I was heartily tired
of being sagacious and prudent by myself, and of seeing my darling under
restraint; so, I bought a pretty pair of ear-rings for her, and a collar
for Jip, and went home one day to make myself agreeable.

Sir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.
Tulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is
always agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of
tribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn’s dress; there is a kind of tribute
in that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general
way, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the
legal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.

Accordingly, he always contemplated his aunt on the _agreeable_, namely,
on her _money_ side. He visited her assiduously, often invited her
to dinner, sent her all sorts of tit-bits from his kitchen, and was
accordingly honoured with the appellation of her "own darling nephew."

Waterloo--that Sir Hudson Lowe married Mrs Susan Johnson, sister of

MY VERY DEAR FORSTER,

‘Which contained--’ interposed Monks, stretching forward.

CHAPTER V.
Paul’s Progress and Christening

‘Why, I hope not,’ returned Mr Swiveller, ‘but the average number of
letters it take to soften her is six, and this time we have got as far
as eight without any effect at all. I’ll write another to-morrow
morning. I mean to blot it a good deal and shake some water over it out
of the pepper-castor to make it look penitent. “I’m in such a state of
mind that I hardly know what I write”--blot--“if you could see me at
this minute shedding tears for my past misconduct”--pepper-castor--“my
hand trembles when I think”--blot again--if that don’t produce the
effect, it’s all over.’

‘Gone!’ cried the other, looking intently in his face.

Grimaldi nodded his entire assent, and they went in and ordered some
bread and cheese, and beer. Having taken the edge off their hunger,
they tossed up a farthing which Grimaldi happened to find in the corner
of some theretofore undiscovered pocket, to determine who should
present the "sixpence." The chance falling on himself, he walked up to
the bar, and with a very lofty air, and laying the questionable metal
down with a dignity quite his own, requested the landlord to take the
bill out of that.

“And if you had—if suffering and danger had driven it from your
thoughts—which it has not—you would remember it now, Walter, when you
find me poor and abandoned, with no home but this, and no friends but
the two who hear me speak!”

“Come here.”

Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell
paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or
whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle
glances; are matters of opinion. The matter of fact, is, that the
matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble’s scowl, but, on the
contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh
thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.

The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected
to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill
at ease, however.

[In acknowledging the vote of thanks, Mr. Dickens said:—]

For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of
picking oakum, Oliver bowed low, by the direction of the beadle, and was
hurried away to a large ward, where, on a rough hard bed, he sobbed
himself to sleep.

"You're to take it in yourself," said the Porter, pointing to a room at
the end of a long passage, opening from the hall. "Everything goes
straight in, on this day of the year. You're not a bit too soon; for the
carriage is at the door now, and they have only come to town for a
couple of hours, a'purpose."

Each man took one slide forward as he was named; butted at the
Honourable Elijah Pogram with his head; shook hands, and slid back
again. The introductions being completed, the spokesman resumed.

“Ouf!” he puffed out, “my back is broken! May Sidi Abd-Allah burn me,
if he is a man.”

"Bob," said Mr. Ben Allen, laying down his knife and fork, and fixing
his eyes on the visage of his friend: "Bob, I'll tell you what it is."

"'He's uncommon fast up to twelve stone; will take five feet, 'coped and
dashed,' without a balk; and live the longest day with any fox-hounds on
the province. At three years old, Peter Brannick refused fifty for him.'

‘Nothing--whatever it is--seems to have done anybody much good who comes
here,’ she returned in all simplicity; ‘but I want to learn just the
same.’

It was with a trembling hand that the child held out to him the money
which a lady had given her at the race-meeting for some wild flowers,
faltering in her thanks as she thought how small the sum was, and
blushing as she offered it.  But he bade her put it up again, and,
stooping, kissed her cheek.

There were no directions for him to give. The people of the house knew
what to do; the proper authorities were soon brought; and they took an
equable business-like possession of the deceased, and of what had been
his property, with no greater disturbance of manner or countenance than
usually attends the winding-up of a clock. Physician was glad to walk
out into the night air--was even glad, in spite of his great experience,
to sit down upon a door-step for a little while: feeling sick and faint.

Eighteen shillings a week! Just, most just, thy censure, upright
Pecksniff! Had it been for the sake of a ribbon, star, or garter;
sleeves of lawn, a great man’s smile, a seat in parliament, a tap upon
the shoulder from a courtly sword; a place, a party, or a thriving lie,
or eighteen thousand pounds, or even eighteen hundred;--but to worship
the golden calf for eighteen shillings a week! oh pitiful, pitiful!

The repeal of the paper duty would benefit the producers of periodicals
immensely. It would make a very large difference to me, in the case of
such a journal as "Household Words." But the gain to the public would be
very small. It would not make the difference of enabling me, for
example, to reduce the price of "Household Words," by its fractional
effect upon a copy, or to increase the quantity of matter. I might, in
putting the difference into my pocket, improve the quality of the paper
a little, but not one man in a thousand would notice it. It _might_
(though I am not sure even of this) remove the difficulties in the way
of a deserving periodical with a small sale. Charles Knight holds that
it would. But the case, on the whole, appeared to me so slight, when I
went to Downing Street with a deputation on the subject, that I said (in
addressing the Chancellor of the Exchequer) I could not honestly
maintain it for a moment as against the soap duty, or any other pressing
on the mass of the poor.

"Well," resumed Pounce, after the waiter had been declared "in the
room," had "taken his orders," and gone "out of the room," and
re-entered the room with the said orders _executed_, preparatory
(paradoxical as it may read) to their being _despatched_,--"Well,"
said Pounce, "when Mr. Snaps returned in the afternoon, he said to me,
rubbing his hands, 'Pounce, it's all right! I have seen the chest of
plate. I have handled and examined every article,--solid and beautiful!
as fine a service as ever was turned out of hand.'

And didn’t you see (says the plate) planted upon my own brother that
astounding blue willow, with knobbed and gnarled trunk, and foliage of
blue ostrich feathers, which gives our family the title of ‘willow
pattern’?  And didn’t you observe, transferred upon him at the same time,
that blue bridge which spans nothing, growing out from the roots of the
willow; and the three blue Chinese going over it into a blue temple,
which has a fine crop of blue bushes sprouting out of the roof; and a
blue boat sailing above them, the mast of which is burglariously sticking
itself into the foundations of a blue villa, suspended sky-high,
surmounted by a lump of blue rock, sky-higher, and a couple of billing
blue birds, sky-highest—together with the rest of that amusing blue
landscape, which has, in deference to our revered ancestors of the
Cerulean Empire, and in defiance of every known law of perspective,
adorned millions of our family ever since the days of platters?  Didn’t
you inspect the copper-plate on which my pattern was deeply engraved?
Didn’t you perceive an impression of it taken in cobalt colour at a
cylindrical press, upon a leaf of thin paper, streaming from a
plunge-bath of soap and water?  Wasn’t the paper impression daintily
spread, by a light-fingered damsel (you know you admired her!), over the
surface of the plate, and the back of the paper rubbed prodigiously
hard—with a long tight roll of flannel, tied up like a round of hung
beef—without so much as ruffling the paper, wet as it was?  Then (says
the plate), was not the paper washed away with a sponge, and didn’t there
appear, set off upon the plate, _this_ identical piece of Pre-Raphaelite
blue distemper which you now behold?  Not to be denied!  I had seen all
this—and more.  I had been shown, at Copeland’s, patterns of beautiful
design, in faultless perspective, which are causing the ugly old willow
to wither out of public favour; and which, being quite as cheap,
insinuate good wholesome natural art into the humblest households.  When
Mr. and Mrs. Sprat have satisfied their material tastes by that equal
division of fat and lean which has made their _ménage_ immortal; and
have, after the elegant tradition, ‘licked the platter clean,’ they
can—thanks to modern artists in clay—feast their intellectual tastes upon
excellent delineations of natural objects.

“He saw his child!”

"There is, then, a sleeping room beyond?"

This little incident led us to reflect upon the most prominent
characteristics of bashful young gentlemen in the abstract; and as this
portable volume will be the great text-book of young ladies in all
future generations, we record them here for their guidance and behoof.

“I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing. O,
my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts.”

"My dear, we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune. If I am
reserved to wear a wig, I am at least prepared, externally," in allusion
to his baldness, "for that distinction. I do not," said Mr. Micawber,
"regret my hair, and I may have been deprived of it for a specific
purpose. I cannot say. It is my intention, my dear Copperfield, to
educate my son for the Church; I will not deny that I should be happy,
on his account, to attain to eminence."

‘Now, my dear Mrs Veneering,’ quoth Lady Tippins, I appeal to you
whether this is not the basest conduct ever known in this world? I carry
my lovers about, two or three at a time, on condition that they are very
obedient and devoted; and here is my oldest lover-in-chief, the head of
all my slaves, throwing off his allegiance before company! And here is
another of my lovers, a rough Cymon at present certainly, but of whom
I had most hopeful expectations as to his turning out well in course of
time, pretending that he can’t remember his nursery rhymes! On purpose
to annoy me, for he knows how I doat upon them!’

"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the
plates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the
curtains and carpets."

“Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.

When he and Martin met again, and were alone, he was in high spirits,
and evidently had something to communicate, in which he gloried very
much.

_Scro._ It's Christmas Day; I haven't missed it. The Spirits have done
it all in one night. They can do any thing they like. Of course they
can. Of course they can. (_Returns to window._) Halloo, my fine fellow!

Nicholas did NOT see that anybody was breakfasting, except Mr. Squeers;
but he bowed with all becoming reverence, and looked as cheerful as he
could.

"His whispers."

With that, he took me down, and tied the placard, which was neatly
constructed for the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; and
wherever I went, afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying it.

‘So I find that I must have a partner who is a man of business and not
guilty of any inventions,’ said Daniel Doyce, taking off his hat to pass
his hand over his forehead, ‘if it’s only in deference to the current
opinion, and to uphold the credit of the Works. I don’t think he’ll find
that I have been very remiss or confused in my way of conducting them;
but that’s for him to say--whoever he is--not for me.’

“Friend, what are those stars which we see shining in the sky at

"Where?" said the East, springing up at the idea of stiff breezes and
swelling sails; "I see no ships."

‘Ah!’ cried Tom, triumphantly, ‘that’s where it is! He has cleaned
me out. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can’t I,
Fagin?’

My dearest cousin,

When Nell had exhausted her first raptures at this glorious sight, Mrs
Jarley ordered the room to be cleared of all but herself and the child,
and, sitting herself down in an arm-chair in the centre, formally
invested Nell with a willow wand, long used by herself for pointing out
the characters, and was at great pains to instruct her in her duty.

"'Arrah! what's vexing ye now?' says I, pulling the third five-pounder
across the cloth.

“It’s a curious coincidence, as you say,” answers Weevle, once more
glancing up and down the court.

“Don’t mind what they say,” Ben Serraq roared out. “They are liars.
Besides, they have a spite against me.”

I am truly sorry to reply to your kind and welcome note that we cannot
come to Knebworth on a visit at this time: firstly, because I am tied by
the leg to my book. Secondly, because my married daughter and her
husband are with us. Thirdly, because my two boys are at home for their
holidays.

“Dear guardian,” said I, “I know how you have felt all that has
happened, and how considerate you have been. As so much time has
passed, and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again,
perhaps you expect me to renew the subject. Perhaps I ought to do so.
I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please.”

‘It is not possible,’ said Mr Abel.

I have received your letter of yesterday's date, and shall content
myself with a brief reply.

“Is it so hard to get?” asked Florence.

At this period of the entertainment, Guster, who has never recovered
her first failure, but has neglected no possible or impossible means
of bringing the establishment and herself into contempt—among which
may be briefly enumerated her unexpectedly performing clashing
military music on Mr. Chadband’s head with plates, and afterwards
crowning that gentleman with muffins—at which period of the
entertainment, Guster whispers Mr. Snagsby that he is wanted.

"Satisfied with what, my dear?" asked Mr. Snitchey.

‘Right! quite right!’ retorted Tigg. ‘And hard it is upon the part
of the law that it should be so confoundedly down upon us unfortunate
victims; when it takes such amazing good interest for itself from all
its clients. But charity begins at home, and justice begins next door.
Well! The law being hard upon us, we’re not exactly soft upon B; for
besides charging B the regular interest, we get B’s premium, and B’s
friends’ premiums, and we charge B for the bond, and, whether we accept
him or not, we charge B for “inquiries” (we keep a man, at a pound a
week, to make ‘em), and we charge B a trifle for the secretary; and in
short, my good fellow, we stick it into B, up hill and down dale, and
make a devilish comfortable little property out of him. Ha, ha, ha! I
drive B, in point of fact,’ said Tigg, pointing to the cabriolet, ‘and a
thoroughbred horse he is. Ha, ha, ha!’

He nodded, and the naked feet had sprung away. He came back with his
lamp, locked his door hastily, and sat down in his chair, covering his
face like one who was frightened at himself.

“Guilty, of course?” said he. “Out with it. Come!”

"Head of the Garrison," said the stranger, in reply to Mr. Tupman's
inquiring look.

‘No,’ said Riderhood, ‘I ain’t. Far from it. Now then! I want to know
how George Radfoot come by his death, and how you come by his kit?’

KENNEDY'S HOTEL, EDINBURGH, _Friday, Dec. 18th, 1868._

‘There’s a house not far from here,’ said the guest when he had written
a few lines, ‘which you call the Warren, I believe?’

"Oh, you did get a talking about the trial," said Serjeant Buzfuz,
brightening up with the anticipation of some important discovery. "Now
what passed about the trial; will you have the goodness to tell us, Mr.
Weller?"

"What's the t'other name?" said Sam Weller, looking round.

“Lined?” inquired the Jew, with eagerness.

Meantime, old Martin Chuzzlewit remained shut up in his own chamber, and
saw no person but his young companion, saving the hostess of the Blue
Dragon, who was, at certain times, admitted to his presence. So surely
as she came into the room, however, Martin feigned to fall asleep. It
was only when he and the young lady were alone, that he would utter a
word, even in answer to the simplest inquiry; though Mr Pecksniff
could make out, by hard listening at the door, that they two being left
together, he was talkative enough.

You gratify me more than I can tell you by what you say about
"Copperfield," the more so as I hope myself that some heretofore-deficient
qualities are there. You are not likely to misunderstand me when I say
that I like it very much, and am deeply interested in it, and that I
have kept and am keeping my mind very steadily upon it.

I obeyed, and the old lady sent for her subaltern, the ouriadnik. While
the servant was gone, the lady and the officer both questioned me, and
judged that it was for some offence that I was sent to Bélogorsk. The
lady informed me that Chvabrine, an officer at Bélogorsk, had been sent
thither for duelling. The ouriadnik appeared, and was a fine specimen
of a Cossack officer.

"Don't know?"

"You are at the crisis of your fate.  Hold your course unchanged a little
longer, and you know what must happen.  _I_ know even better than you can
imagine, that, after that has happened, you are lost.  No man who could
shed those tears could bear those marks."

[Illustration: ALL THIS TIME, THE BEREAVED FATHER HAS NOT BEEN SEEN EVEN
BY HIS ATTENDANT; FOR HE SITS IN A CORNER OF HIS OWN DARK ROOM--Chap.

‘You can’t do that, John?’

"Well?" said Mr. Pickwick.

We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come, tearing
up the miry sleet and thawing snow as if they were torn up by a
waterwheel.

At length, when this determination had been announced half a hundred
times, the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic,
wished to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her
years or station, and that she should be obliged to beg and pray, in
that way, of her own nephew, whom she remembered about five-and-twenty
years before he was born, and whom she had known, personally, when he
hadn’t a tooth in his head; to say nothing of her presence on the first
occasion of his having his hair cut, and assistance at numerous other
times and ceremonies during his babyhood, of sufficient importance to
found a claim upon his affection, obedience, and sympathies, for ever.

“No one sees him. When this crisis of his affairs renders it necessary
for him to come out of his house, he comes out for the occasion, and
again goes home, and shuts himself up, and will see no one. He has
written me a letter, acknowledging our past connexion in higher terms
than it deserved, and parting from me. I am delicate of obtruding
myself upon him now, never having had much intercourse with him in
better times; but I have tried to do so. I have written, gone there,
entreated. Quite in vain.”

My book I enclose. There is a slight alteration (which does not affect
you) at the end of the first act, in order that the piece may be played
through without having the drop curtain down. You will not find the
situations or business difficult, with me on the spot to put you right.

‘Not I!’ rejoined the other, getting into his cart. ‘It’s a fine
day, after all.’ And he drove away.

‘I’m _so_ afraid you’ll catch cold, aunt--have a silk handkerchief to
tie round your dear old head--you really should take care of yourself--
consider your age!’

A party, having less in common with such an occasion, could hardly
have been got together by any ingenuity. Such a mean mission as the
domestic mission was the very last thing to be endured among them;
indeed, Miss Wisk informed us, with great indignation, before we sat
down to breakfast, that the idea of woman’s mission lying chiefly in
the narrow sphere of home was an outrageous slander on the part of
her tyrant, man. One other singularity was that nobody with a
mission—except Mr. Quale, whose mission, as I think I have formerly
said, was to be in ecstasies with everybody’s mission—cared at all
for anybody’s mission. Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only
one infallible course was her course of pouncing upon the poor and
applying benevolence to them like a strait-waistcoat; as Miss Wisk
was that the only practical thing for the world was the emancipation
of woman from the thraldom of her tyrant, man. Mrs. Jellyby, all the
while, sat smiling at the limited vision that could see anything but
Borrioboola-Gha.

For five days and a half, it seemed quite useless and hopeless to alter
the ship's course so as to stand out of the way of this ice.  I made what
southing I could; but, all that time, we were beset by it.  Mrs.
Atherfield after standing by me on deck once, looking for some time in an
awed manner at the great bergs that surrounded us, said in a whisper, "O!
Captain Ravender, it looks as if the whole solid earth had changed into
ice, and broken up!"  I said to her, laughing, "I don't wonder that it
does, to your inexperienced eyes, my dear."  But I had never seen a
twentieth part of the quantity, and, in reality, I was pretty much of her
opinion.

Mr. Weller shook his head. He was wholly unable to speak; vague thoughts
of some wicked widow having been successful in her designs on Mr.
Pickwick, choked his utterance.

‘I thought they might be,’ said Squeers, coolly. ‘We have a good many of
them; that boy’s one.’

“A bad one—I’ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,” growled Mr.
Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle
of his face.

We asked if that were a friend of Richard’s.

‘Don’t take it to heart,’ said Nicholas; ‘it’s of no consequence; you
see I don’t care about it; you followed the wrong person, that’s all.’

The arrangements are, as yet, in an imperfect state; for the date of
their being carried out depends on our being able to get one of the
large theatres before the close of the present London season. In the
event of our succeeding, we purpose acting in London, on Wednesday the
14th of July, and on Monday the 19th. On the first occasion we shall
play "Every Man in His Humour," and a farce; on the second, "The Merry
Wives of Windsor," and a farce.

least I may verify it.”

Then the cakes came in for consideration.  I offered the carrier one
which he ate at a gulp, without the slightest change of expression.

Mr. Jasper has closed his eyes as the auctioneer has deepened his
voice. He now abruptly opens them, and says, in unison with the
deepened voice “Ah!”—rather as if stopping himself on the extreme verge
of adding—“men!”

We separated at an early hour, and I afterwards met my new _friends_
at an hotel in the Fauxbourg St. Honoré, where there was, as usual, an
écarté-table. Ecarté was then all the rage; though, like our all-fours,
it had originally been the game of the _peuple_, or rather in Paris of
the _laquais_. It is a game uniting skill and chance; but it is a game
of countenance; a game, also, in which the cards played with, being
fewer in number than at whist, it is no difficult matter to scratch an
important one, so as to know in time of need where to find it, or to
_sauter le coup_. That evening, for the first time, I was induced to
take a hand, and, in my innocence of such manoeuvres, wondered that my
opponent turned up the king so much oftener than myself. In time my eyes
were opened, and I discovered that other _tricheries_ were practicable.
For instance, one morning, after a ball given by an English lady, there
were found rolled up in one corner of the room two queens and a knave;
and, on examining the écarté packs, these were missing,--had literally
been discarded,--a circumstance which rendered the success of two
officers of the _garde de corps_, who cleaned out the party, by no means
problematical. But I was now initiated; and a witty writer says,

At the corner of the lane, Jasper, hotly enraged, checks his companion
and looks back. All is silent. Next moment, a stone coming rattling at
his hat, and a distant yell of “Wake-Cock! Warning!” followed by a
crow, as from some infernally-hatched Chanticleer, apprising him under
whose victorious fire he stands, he turns the corner into safety, and
takes Durdles home: Durdles stumbling among the litter of his stony
yard as if he were going to turn head foremost into one of the
unfinished tombs.

‘Poor Annie! She’s so faithful and tender-hearted! It’s the parting from
her old playfellow and friend--her favourite cousin--that has done this.
Ah! It’s a pity! I am very sorry!’

"Then _we_ are Blue," said Mr. Pickwick; but observing that the man
looked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement, he gave him
his card, and desired him to present it to Mr. Perker forthwith, if he
should happen to be in the house. The waiter retired; and reappearing
almost immediately with a request that Mr. Pickwick would follow him,
led the way to a large room on the first floor, where, seated at a long
table covered with books and papers, was Mr. Perker.

The cherub, whose hair would have done for itself under the influence of
this amazing spectacle, what Bella had just now done for it, staggered
back into the window-seat from which he had risen, and surveyed the pair
with his eyes dilated to their utmost.

After tea there were exercises again, and preparations for next day by
candlelight. And in due course there was bed; where, but for that
resumption of the studies which took place in dreams, were rest and
sweet forgetfulness.

“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good
in you! Go on!”

“I tell you I’m as sound as a colt.”

"Hello--the house!"

‘Where should I go on to?’ cried the mother of the modern Gracchi.

There were still other friends of their souls who were not entitled to
be asked to dinner, but had a claim to be invited to come and take a
haunch of mutton vapour-bath at half-past nine. For the clearing off
of these worthies, Mrs Podsnap added a small and early evening to the
dinner, and looked in at the music-shop to bespeak a well-conducted
automaton to come and play quadrilles for a carpet dance.

I turned hot and cold; I trembled; my heart beat fast, and my breath
failed.

CHAPTER XI

“The miserable man you saw, is worse, and nothing I can say will wake him
from his terrible infatuation. William’s father has turned childish in a
moment, William himself is changed. The shock has been too sudden for
him; I cannot understand him; he is not like himself. Oh, Mr. Redlaw,
pray advise me, help me!”

By degrees these raptures subsided, and Mrs. Nickleby went on to
entertain her guests with a lament over her fallen fortunes, and a
picturesque account of her old house in the country: comprising a full
description of the different apartments, not forgetting the little
store-room, and a lively recollection of how many steps you went down to
get into the garden, and which way you turned when you came out at the
parlour door, and what capital fixtures there were in the kitchen. This
last reflection naturally conducted her into the wash-house, where she
stumbled upon the brewing utensils, among which she might have wandered
for an hour, if the mere mention of those implements had not, by an
association of ideas, instantly reminded Mr. Pyke that he was ‘amazing
thirsty.’

‘Yes; he’s my boy,’ replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and
putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.

‘Very good,’ said Dodson, rising; ‘I am quite ready.’

‘I’m glad Miss Dolly can laugh,’ cried Miggs with a feeble titter. ‘I
like to see folks a-laughing--so do you, mim, don’t you? You was always
glad to see people in spirits, wasn’t you, mim? And you always did your
best to keep ‘em cheerful, didn’t you, mim? Though there an’t such a
great deal to laugh at now either; is there, mim? It an’t so much of a
catch, after looking out so sharp ever since she was a little chit, and
costing such a deal in dress and show, to get a poor, common soldier,
with one arm, is it, mim? He he! I wouldn’t have a husband with one arm,
anyways. I would have two arms. I would have two arms, if it was me,
though instead of hands they’d only got hooks at the end, like our
dustman!’

‘I wished to pay my respects.’

If he could have known what passed within, the knowledge would have
yielded him no clue to this mysterious vigil. At twilight, Mr Haredale
shut himself up, and at daybreak he came forth. He never missed a night,
always came and went alone, and never varied his proceedings in the
least degree.

"Come, come, father," said Sam, "none o' these little lovins afore
strangers. Here's the reverend gen'lm'n a comin' in now."

‘You were not here last Sunday night,’ he said.

Oh! Tom’s blood was rising; mind that! Perhaps the Boar’s Head had
something to do with it, but certainly the footman had. So had the sight
of his pretty sister--a great deal to do with it. Tom could bear a good
deal himself, but he was proud of her, and pride is a sensitive thing.
He began to think, ‘there are more Pecksniffs than one, perhaps,’ and by
all the pins and needles that run up and down in angry veins, Tom was in
a most unusual tingle all at once!

To conclude as I began.  My position is, that if we have anything to
learn from the Noble Savage, it is what to avoid.  His virtues are a
fable; his happiness is a delusion; his nobility, nonsense.

By the place where Rachael lived, though it was not in his way; by the
red brick streets; by the great silent factories, not trembling yet; by
the railway, where the danger-lights were waning in the strengthening
day; by the railway’s crazy neighbourhood, half pulled down and half
built up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens
were sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by
coal-dust paths and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got to the top of
the hill, and looked back.

‘SHE is the lady I speak of,’ said brother Charles. Like the famous
parrot, Nicholas thought a great deal, but was unable to utter a word.

“Here!” interposed the Captain, as an assurance that he was at hand,
and might be relied upon.

I called him in.  The appearance of the low-minded cove was hailed with
disapprobation from all sides, on account of his having brought his
corkscrew with him.  He pleaded “the force of habit.”

At last Mr Flintwinch came shuffling down the staircase into the
hall, muttering and calling ‘Affery woman!’ all the way. Affery still
remaining behind her apron, he came stumbling down the kitchen stairs,
candle in hand, sidled up to her, twitched her apron off, and roused
her.

Ever faithfully yours.

‘Civil words!’ cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.
‘Civil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve ‘em from me. I thieved
for you when I was a child not half as old as this!’ pointing to
Oliver. ‘I have been in the same trade, and in the same service,
for twelve years since. Don’t you know it? Speak out! Don’t you know
it?’

‘Pray, does Mr Henry Gowan paint--ha--Portraits?’ inquired Mr Dorrit.

PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER'

“Here, Charlotte,” said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,
“give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He
hasn’t come home since the morning, so he may go without ’em. I dare
say the boy isn’t too dainty to eat ’em—are you, boy?”

I gave a little shudder of repulsion.

Tom Walker, however, was not a man to be troubled with any fears of
the kind. He reposed himself for some time on the trunk of a fallen
hemlock, listening to the boding cry of the tree-toad, and delving
with his walking-staff into a mound of black mould at his feet. As he
turned up the soil unconsciously, his staff struck against something
hard. He raked it out of the vegetable mould, and lo! a cloven skull,
with an Indian tomahawk buried deep in it, lay before him. The rust on
the weapon showed the time that had elapsed since this death-blow had
been given. It was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had
taken place in this last foothold of the Indian warriors.

She was more than human to me. She was a Fairy, a Sylph, I don’t
know what she was--anything that no one ever saw, and everything that
everybody ever wanted. I was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an
instant. There was no pausing on the brink; no looking down, or looking
back; I was gone, headlong, before I had sense to say a word to her.

TUNE--'A COBBLER THERE WAS'

“Yes, father,” said Allan, looking as grave as if power of life and
death were in his hands.

The Secretary bowed.

At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,
and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.
Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice
as he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up
appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the
burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his
surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.

‘I see it,’ answered Peg.

"God bless us, every one!" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.

‘One which would rather astonish the ignorant people down there,’ said
Mr. Tulrumble.

"This is my nephew," said my aunt.

‘What saith the young man?’ demanded Sir Norfolk. ‘If he will
oppignerate his word for taciturnity, I will take it.’

The room was one of a very homely description, and was apparently
under the especial patronage of stage coachmen: for several gentlemen,
who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession,
were drinking and smoking in the different boxes. Among the number was
one stout, red-faced, elderly man in particular, seated in an opposite
box, who attracted Mr. Pickwick's attention. The stout man was smoking
with great vehemence, but between every half-dozen puffs, he took his
pipe from his mouth, and looked first at Mr. Weller and then at Mr.
Pickwick. Then, he would bury in a quart pot as much of his countenance
as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving, and
take another look at Sam and Mr. Pickwick. Then he would take another
half-dozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them
again. At last the stout man, putting up his legs on the seat, and
leaning his back against the wall, began to puff at his pipe without
leaving off at all, and to stare through the smoke at the new-comers,
as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them.

speaks more touchingly the state of his engrossed soul than all the
fine metaphors ever vented. The supercilious Spartans in the days of
their success prided themselves upon the laconic brevity of their
despatches to states in hostility or alliance with them. When they were
sinking before the Macedonians, another style was adopted; and Philip
observed that he had taught them to lengthen their monosyllables. Real
love has had a contrary effect upon Romeo. It has abridged his swelling
passages, and brought him to the language of prose. The reason of the
alteration is the same in both cases. The brevity of the Spartans
was the result of studied affectation. They sought, by the insolence
of threats obscurely insinuated in a sort of demi-oracular language,
to impose upon others,--perhaps they imposed upon themselves,--an
extravagant opinion of their mysterious power. The secret was found
out at last, and their anger bubbled over in big words and lengthened
sentences. The love of Rosaline is as much affected on the part of
Romeo, and it explodes in wire-drawn conceits.

“No!” said Tom. “You ain’t angry with ME.”

It was a very Moloch of a baby, on whose insatiate altar the whole
existence of this particular young brother was offered up a daily
sacrifice. Its personality may be said to have consisted in its never
being quiet, in any one place, for five consecutive minutes, and never
going to sleep when required. “Tetterby’s baby” was as well known in the
neighbourhood as the postman or the pot-boy. It roved from door-step to
door-step, in the arms of little Johnny Tetterby, and lagged heavily at
the rear of troops of juveniles who followed the Tumblers or the Monkey,
and came up, all on one side, a little too late for everything that was
attractive, from Monday morning until Saturday night. Wherever childhood
congregated to play, there was little Moloch making Johnny fag and toil.
Wherever Johnny desired to stay, little Moloch became fractious, and
would not remain. Whenever Johnny wanted to go out, Moloch was asleep,
and must be watched. Whenever Johnny wanted to stay at home, Moloch was
awake, and must be taken out. Yet Johnny was verily persuaded that it
was a faultless baby, without its peer in the realm of England, and was
quite content to catch meek glimpses of things in general from behind its
skirts, or over its limp flapping bonnet, and to go staggering about with
it like a very little porter with a very large parcel, which was not
directed to anybody, and could never be delivered anywhere.

The dark shadow passed from Mr. Tupman's face, as he warmly grasped the
hand of his friend.

"Contrary ways, please God!" cried Peggotty, with great animation. "As

“After you have heard the doctor’s report,” sneered Bonelle.

It was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their
four-footed companion turned into the lane leading to Manor Farm: and
even when they were so near their place of destination, the pleasure
they would have otherwise experienced was materially damped as they
reflected on the singularity of their appearance, and the absurdity of
their situation. Torn clothes, lacerated faces, dusty shoes, exhausted
looks, and, above all, the horse. Oh, how Mr. Pickwick cursed that
horse: he had eyed the noble animal from time to time with looks
expressive of hatred and revenge; more than once he had calculated the
probable amount of the expense he would incur by cutting his throat;
and now the temptation to destroy him, or to cast him loose upon the
world, rushed upon his mind with tenfold force. He was roused from a
meditation on these dire imaginings, by the sudden appearance of two
figures at a turn of the lane. It was Mr. Wardle, and his faithful
attendant, the fat boy.

Let me be calmer yet; I would be calm as coffins.  You have published a
letter from one whose likeness is engraved, but whose name (and
wherefore?) is suppressed.  Shall _I_ breathe that name!  Is it—but why
ask when my heart tells me too truly that it is!

“Him with a hook, Miss?” rejoined Rob, with an illustrative twist of
his left hand. Yes, Miss. He was here the day before yesterday.”

"I'll begin," says the Major looking as tall as ever he did, "to-morrow."

But the very genteel lady’s English chariot being already horsed and at
the inn-door, the landlord had slipped up-stairs to represent his hard
case. This was notified to the yard by his now coming down the staircase
in attendance on the gentleman and the lady, and by his pointing out the
offended majesty of Mr Dorrit to them with a significant motion of his
hand.

‘You think so, don’t you?’ said Tom.  And shut up his eye again.

‘I’m glad to hear it,’ said Ralph. ‘I hope you’ll do your duty.’

CHRISTMAS CAROL IN PROSE. 1s.

That's all the news. Everything I can describe by hook or by crook, I
describe for H. W. So there is nothing of that sort left for letters.

Lizzie took the hand which the dolls’ dressmaker held out to her for
the purpose of being supported away, but only looked at her with an
inquiring smile, and made no other movement.

"Now, mind!" she exclaimed, turning back on her way to the door, and
looking shrewdly at me, with her forefinger up again. "I have some
reason to suspect, from what I have heard--my ears are always open; I
can't afford to spare what powers I have--that they are gone abroad. But
if ever they return, if ever any one of them returns, while I am alive,
I am more likely than another, going about as I do, to find it out soon.
Whatever I know, you shall know. If ever I can do anything to serve the
poor betrayed girl, I will do it faithfully, please Heaven! And Littimer
had better have a bloodhound at his back, than little Mowcher!"

The squire in the mean time was getting impatient for his return,
and, when Andy made his appearance, asked if there was a letter for
him.--"There is, sir," said Andy.

Of all this, Cousin Feenix delivered himself with an obviously nervous
and discomposed air. Then, giving his arm to Florence, and putting the
strongest possible constraint upon his wilful legs, which seemed
determined to go out into the garden, he led her to the door, and
handed her into a carriage that was ready for her reception.

Redlaw could not reply by any word; for when he saw that fatal sign he
knew so well now, of the wandering hand upon the forehead, his voice died
at his lips. But he made some indication of assent.

Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached
the cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on
both sides.

When Miss Pupford and her assistant first foregathered, is not known to
men, or pupils.  But, it was long ago.  A belief would have established
itself among pupils that the two once went to school together, were it
not for the difficulty and audacity of imagining Miss Pupford born
without mittens, and without a front, and without a bit of gold wire
among her front teeth, and without little dabs of powder on her neat
little face and nose.  Indeed, whenever Miss Pupford gives a little
lecture on the mythology of the misguided heathens (always carefully
excluding Cupid from recognition), and tells how Minerva sprang,
perfectly equipped, from the brain of Jupiter, she is half supposed to
hint, "So I myself came into the world, completely up in Pinnock,
Mangnall, Tables, and the use of the Globes."

Some people fancy all these little dainties together (and sweet preserves
beside), by way of relish to their roast pig.  They are generally those
dyspeptic ladies and gentlemen who eat unheard-of quantities of hot corn
bread (almost as good for the digestion as a kneaded pin-cushion), for
breakfast, and for supper.  Those who do not observe this custom, and who
help themselves several times instead, usually suck their knives and
forks meditatively, until they have decided what to take next: then pull
them out of their mouths: put them in the dish; help themselves; and fall
to work again.  At dinner, there is nothing to drink upon the table, but
great jugs full of cold water.  Nobody says anything, at any meal, to
anybody.  All the passengers are very dismal, and seem to have tremendous
secrets weighing on their minds.  There is no conversation, no laughter,
no cheerfulness, no sociality, except in spitting; and that is done in
silent fellowship round the stove, when the meal is over.  Every man sits
down, dull and languid; swallows his fare as if breakfasts, dinners, and
suppers, were necessities of nature never to be coupled with recreation
or enjoyment; and having bolted his food in a gloomy silence, bolts
himself, in the same state.  But for these animal observances, you might
suppose the whole male portion of the company to be the melancholy ghosts
of departed book-keepers, who had fallen dead at the desk: such is their
weary air of business and calculation.  Undertakers on duty would be
sprightly beside them; and a collation of funeral-baked meats, in
comparison with these meals, would be a sparkling festivity.

"Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down
the pen again.

The little book is now, as far as I am concerned, all ready. One cut of
Doyle's and one of Leech's I found so unlike my ideas, that I had them
both to breakfast with me this morning, and with that winning manner
which you know of, got them with the highest good humour to do both
afresh. They are now hard at it. Stanfield's readiness, delight, wonder
at my being pleased with what he has done is delicious. Mac's
frontispiece is charming. The book is quite splendid; the expenses will
be very great, I have no doubt.

The spot selected for the combats commanded a fine view of Westminster
Abbey, which reared its massive body and tall towers above a range of
mean habitations masking its base. Cawing jackdaws in clouds wheeled in
the sunny air above its pinnacles.

‘Do you live in London?’ inquired Oliver.

We had a cold journey here from Boulogne, but the roads were not very
bad. The malle poste, however, now takes the trains at Amiens. We missed
it by ten minutes, and had to wait three hours--from twelve o'clock
until three, in which interval I drank brandy and water, and slept like
a top. It is delightful travelling for its speed, that malle poste, and
really for its comfort too. But on this occasion it was not remarkable
for the last-named quality. The director of the post at Boulogne told me
a lamentable story of his son at Paris being ill, and implored me to
bring him on. The brave doubted the representations altogether, but I
couldn't find it in my heart to say no; so we brought the director,
bodkinwise, and being a large man, in a great number of greatcoats, he
crushed us dismally until we got to the railroad. For two passengers
(and it never carries more) it is capital. For three, excruciating.

“What is it?”

‘Please to sit down again, Sir, and consider yourself welcome.--Why,
yes,’ said Plornish, taking a chair, and lifting the elder child upon
his knee, that he might have the moral support of speaking to a stranger
over his head, ‘I have been on the wrong side of the Lock myself, and
in that way we come to know Miss Dorrit. Me and my wife, we are well
acquainted with Miss Dorrit.’

‘Well, you _are_ a nice young ‘ooman for a musical party, you are,’ said
the boot-cleaner. ‘Look at these here boots--eleven pair o’ boots; and
one shoe as belongs to number six, with the wooden leg. The eleven boots
is to be called at half-past eight and the shoe at nine. Who’s number
twenty-two, that’s to put all the others out? No, no; reg’lar rotation,
as Jack Ketch said, ven he tied the men up. Sorry to keep you a-waitin’,
Sir, but I’ll attend to you directly.’

David knelt down to say his prayers that night in a pleasant room facing
the sea, and as he lay in the clean, snow-white bed, he prayed he might
never be homeless again, and might never forget the homeless.

The lady was at the upper end of the room. As Mr. Pickwick bowed,
he took his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket and put them on;
a process which he had no sooner gone through, than, uttering an
exclamation of surprise, Mr. Pickwick retreated several paces, and
the lady, with a half-suppressed scream, hid her face in her hands,
and dropped into a chair; whereupon Mr. Peter Magnus was stricken
motionless on the spot, and gazed from one to the other, with a
countenance expressive of the extremities of horror and surprise.

In the report for the half-year next following, the deaths by machinery
in factories were eighteen; one hundred and sixty-one lost the right
hand, or, more generally, parts of it; one hundred and eighteen the
left hand, or parts of it; two hundred and twenty had bones broken.
Thirty-nine, therefore, was the number of deaths in the year last
reported (a fresh half-yearly report is at present due), and there
was no lack of accidents more serious than the “rubbing off a bit of
skin.” Of the factory accidents, we are also told, not five per cent.
are owing to machinery. If so, great indeed must be the number of the
whole! But it is solely of the accidents arising from machinery that
we from the first have spoken, since upon them only the law is founded
which we wish to see maintained.

Amy opened a drawer in an old piece of furniture that was a chest of
drawers above and a bedstead below, and produced two little bundles,
which she handed to her brother and sister. ‘Mended and made up?’
Clennam heard the sister ask in a whisper. To which Amy answered ‘Yes.’
He had risen now, and took the opportunity of glancing round the room.
The bare walls had been coloured green, evidently by an unskilled hand,
and were poorly decorated with a few prints. The window was curtained,
and the floor carpeted; and there were shelves and pegs, and other such
conveniences, that had accumulated in the course of years. It was a
close, confined room, poorly furnished; and the chimney smoked to boot,
or the tin screen at the top of the fireplace was superfluous; but
constant pains and care had made it neat, and even, after its kind,
comfortable.

‘Fifteen shillings a week is not much,’ said Nicholas, mildly.

‘He’s shocked at the way your father goes on in,’ replied Mrs. Weller.

‘Who are you?’ said Mr. Fang.

‘Gashford!’ cried Lord George, pressing his secretary’s arm tight within
his own, and speaking with as much emotion in his voice, as in his
altered face, ‘I am called indeed, now. I feel and know it. I am the
leader of a host. If they summoned me at this moment with one voice to
lead them on to death, I’d do it--Yes, and fall first myself!’

‘They resided,’ said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the
interruption, ‘in a part of the country to which your father in
his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.
Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other.
Your father was gifted as few men are. He had his sister’s soul and
person. As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love
him. I would that it had ended there. His daughter did the same.’

The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange
voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He
obeyed.

Your furreners, that come abroad
      Into our Irish nation,
    Expectin' nothin' else but fraud
      And cut-throat dissertation;
    What is't they find on landin' first
      But hundred _millia-falthas_,
    And kindness that we still have nurs'd?
      Tho' slav'ry near has spoilth us!
        Wirra! wirra! wirrasthrue!
          Wouldn't Erin's glory,
            With the pen
            Of clever men,
          Make a weepin' story?

‘What! You’re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?’
inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. ‘Ugh!’

‘Passion and distrust have left me!’ said the Carrier; ‘and nothing but
my grief remains.  In an unhappy moment some old lover, better suited to
her tastes and years than I; forsaken, perhaps, for me, against her will;
returned.  In an unhappy moment, taken by surprise, and wanting time to
think of what she did, she made herself a party to his treachery, by
concealing it.  Last night she saw him, in the interview we witnessed.
It was wrong.  But otherwise than this she is innocent if there is truth
on earth!’

“And always alone?”

‘Allong and marshong, indeed. It would be more creditable to you,
I think, to let other people allong and marshong about their lawful
business, instead of shutting ‘em up in quarantine!’

It has been since supposed, with some reason, that this slumber was a
sham or feint, as she contrived to slip away unobserved in the dusk of
the afternoon.  Whether this was an intentional and waking departure,
or a somnambulistic leave-taking and walking in her sleep, may remain a
subject of contention; but, on one point (and indeed the main one) all
parties are agreed.  In whatever state she walked away, she certainly
did not walk back again.

When the salt-cellar, and the fowl’s breast, and the trifle, and the
lobster salad were all exhausted, and could not afford standing-room for
another solitary witticism, the keeper performed that very dangerous feat
which is still done with some of the caravan lions, although in one
instance it terminated fatally, of putting his head in the animal’s
mouth, and placing himself entirely at its mercy.  Boswell frequently
presents a melancholy instance of the lamentable results of this
achievement, and other keepers and jackals have been terribly lacerated
for their daring.  It is due to our lion to state, that he condescended
to be trifled with, in the most gentle manner, and finally went home with
the showman in a hack cab: perfectly peaceable, but slightly fuddled.

When the breakfast was cleared away, the merry old gentleman and
the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was
performed in this way:--The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in
one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in
his waistcoat-pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking
a mock diamond pin in his shirt, buttoned his coat tight round him,
and, putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in the pockets,
trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner
in which old gentlemen walk about the streets every hour in the day.
Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door,
making belief that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows.
At such times he would look constantly round him for fear of thieves,
and keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn't lost
anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed
till the tears ran down his face. All this time the two boys followed
him closely about, getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he
turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions. At last
the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidentally, while
Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment
they took from him with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box,
note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief,--even
the spectacle-case. If the old gentleman felt a hand in any one of his
pockets, he cried out where it was, and then the game began all over
again.

"_Half-past seven._

Affectionately yours.

“But I want, in the young lady’s name, to know. You may trust me. No
one else shall hear.”

Still Gride made no answer, but tore and scratched among the papers, and
yelled and screeched like a fiend in torment.

In spite of his respect for Captain Cuttle, Walter could not help
inwardly rejoicing at the absence of this sage, and devoutly hoping
that his limpid intellect might not be brought to bear on his
difficulties until they were quite settled.

‘Who says so, sir?’ asked Mark.

‘In the meantime, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, ‘they are much disliked;
and as they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them
to perdition, we really have a good deal of perdition going on in
our neighbourhood! However, as Mrs. Chillip says, sir, they undergo a
continual punishment; for they are turned inward, to feed upon their own
hearts, and their own hearts are very bad feeding. Now, sir, about that
brain of yours, if you’ll excuse my returning to it. Don’t you expose it
to a good deal of excitement, sir?’

We were not without our fears that the waiter rushed out to hang himself;
and we were much relieved by his fetching somebody,—in graceful, flowing
skirts and with a waist,—who very soon settled Mr. Indignation Cocker’s
business.

Hilda bent anxiously over him, and tried to soothe him, but he pushed
her gently away.

‘I an’t,’ said Brittles.

‘What is it? Something to drink?’ asked Steerforth.

‘Are you sure?  An’t you cold?’

I tried to pacify Dora, but she turned away her face, and shook her
curls from side to side, and said "You cruel, cruel boy!" so many times,
that I really did not exactly know what to do: so I took a few turns up
and down the room in my uncertainty, and came back again.

‘Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?’ inquired
the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on
the table.

He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.

The two medical attendants exchanged a look across the bed; and the
Physician, stooping down, whispered in the child’s ear. Not having
understood the purport of his whisper, the little creature turned her
perfectly colourless face and deep dark eyes towards him; but without
loosening her hold in the least.

‘To be sure I did!’ cried Hugh, his passion rising, as the other meant
it should; ‘and I say it all over now, again. I’d do anything to have
some revenge on him--anything. And when you told me that he and all
the Catholics would suffer from those who joined together under that
handbill, I said I’d make one of ‘em, if their master was the devil
himself. I AM one of ‘em. See whether I am as good as my word and turn
out to be among the foremost, or no. I mayn’t have much head, master,
but I’ve head enough to remember those that use me ill. You shall see,
and so shall he, and so shall hundreds more, how my spirit backs me
when the time comes. My bark is nothing to my bite. Some that I know had
better have a wild lion among ‘em than me, when I am fairly loose--they
had!’

‘There go the three-quarters past!’ muttered Newman Noggs, listening
to the chimes of some neighbouring church ‘and my dinner time’s two. He
does it on purpose. He makes a point of it. It’s just like him.’

Our Opening Chaunt.

‘Have you told her so, Mr. Barkis?’

"Never was such cards," said the fat gentleman.

He pointed behind him at the boat, and gasped to that degree that he
dropped upon the stones to get his breath.

Mr Pancks answered, with an unction which there is no language to
convey, ‘We rather think so.’

About a twelvemonth ago, as we were strolling through Covent-garden (we
had been thinking about these things over-night), we were attracted by
the very prepossessing appearance of a pickpocket, who having declined
to take the trouble of walking to the Police-office, on the ground that
he hadn’t the slightest wish to go there at all, was being conveyed
thither in a wheelbarrow, to the huge delight of a crowd.

"I am not, indeed."

‘Mr. Bounderby,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘you are unusually slow, sir, with
your breakfast this morning.’

“Nonsense; orders,” said Polly.

The face he turned up to the troubled sky, the quivering of his clasped
hands, the agony of his figure, remain associated with the lonely waste,
in my remembrance, to this hour. It is always night there, and he is the
only object in the scene.

“The doctor owned that you had a wonderfully strong constitution.”

CHAPTER XXVIII -- LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS
ADVENTURES

‘Is it for Chertsey, too, ma’am?’ inquired Oliver; impatient to
execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the
letter.

“I left here early,” pursued Edith, “purposely to sit upstairs and talk
with you. But, going to your room, I found my bird was flown, and I
have been waiting there ever since, expecting its return.

Miss Haredale stood beside her chair, regarding her with silent pity.
She remained for a little time quite still; then rose and turned to Mr
Haredale, who had sat down in his easy chair, and was contemplating her
with fixed attention.

De Kock, M. Paul, paper by, 360.

‘I suppress my ardour to embrace you and achieve this interesting
business, in order that you may have leisure to adjust its details to
our perfect mutual satisfaction.

"Don't you?" asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.

‘The heavy blow,’ said the old lady, ‘of losing the dear girl who
has so long been my comfort and happiness.’

These are my opinions, founded, I believe, on some knowledge of facts
and some observation. If I could be scared out of them, let me add in
all good humour, by such easily-impressed words as "antichristian" or
"irreligious," I should think that I deserved them in their real
signification.

"How is that, Sam?" said Mr. Pickwick; "aren't the names down on the
way-bill?"

I have altered this place very much since you were here, and have made a
pretty (I think an unusually pretty) drawing-room. I wish you would come
back and see it. My being on the Dover line, and my being very fond of
France, occasion me to cross the Channel perpetually. Whenever I feel
that I have worked too much, or am on the eve of overdoing it, and want
a change, away I go by the mail-train, and turn up in Paris or anywhere
else that suits my humour, next morning. So I come back as fresh as a
daisy, and preserve as ruddy a face as though I never leant over a sheet
of paper. When I retire from a literary life I think of setting up as a
Channel pilot.

If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have
betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that
there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement
but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear
in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the
marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I
escaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to
have a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own
mind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended
experiences.

‘Why, highty tighty, sir!’ cried Mrs Gamp, ‘is these your manners? You
want a pitcher of cold water throw’d over you to bring you round; that’s
my belief, and if you was under Betsey Prig you’d have it, too, I do
assure you, Mr Chuffey. Spanish Flies is the only thing to draw this
nonsense out of you; and if anybody wanted to do you a kindness, they’d
clap a blister of ‘em on your head, and put a mustard poultige on your
back. ‘Who’s dead, indeed! It wouldn’t be no grievous loss if some one
was, I think!’

After a time she rang the bell. "Janet," said my aunt, when her servant
came in. "Go up stairs, give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and say I wish
to speak to him."

There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie
appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who
by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating
an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might
encounter in the streets when he went out.

‘Ill!’ replied the Old Soldier. ‘My dear sir, he’s all sorts of things.’

‘Next month.’

The gentleman with the cane lifted his hat and had begun to tender an
apology, which Mr Haredale had begun as hastily to acknowledge and walk
away, when he stopped short and cried, ‘Haredale! Gad bless me, this is
strange indeed!’

“That is enough, sir,” said Mr. Datchery.

On the opposite side of the road was their place of worship: a cool,
clean edifice of wood, with large windows and green blinds: like a
spacious summer-house.  As there was no getting into this place, and
nothing was to be done but walk up and down, and look at it and the other
buildings in the village (which were chiefly of wood, painted a dark red
like English barns, and composed of many stories like English factories),
I have nothing to communicate to the reader, beyond the scanty results I
gleaned the while our purchases were making.

“Here they are,” replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. “You
loaded them yourself.”

‘I shall thus have much improvement to effect in my sweet child,’ Mrs
Sparkler continued, ‘and cannot have her near me too soon. Amiable and
dear little Twoshoes! As to the settlement of poor papa’s affairs, my
interest in that is not very selfish. Papa behaved very generously to me
when I was married, and I have little or nothing to expect. Provided
he had made no will that can come into force, leaving a legacy to Mrs
General, I am contented. Dear papa, dear papa.’

‘I’m his poor mother, sir,’--sobbed Mrs Nubbles, curtseying humbly,
‘and this is his brother, sir.  Oh dear me, dear me!’

“You don’t know of any other,” retorted Mrs Chick. “More shame for you,
I was going to say.”

“’Ware that there mound by the yard-gate, Mister Jarsper.”

'Nothing, Ma'am, upon my honour,' said Mr. Pickwick, nodding his head
    so energetically, that the tassel of his nightcap danced again.  'I
    am almost ready to sink, Ma'am, beneath the confusion of addressing a
    lady in my nightcap (here the lady hastily snatched off her's), but I
    can't get it off, Ma'am (here Mr. Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug
    in proof of the statment).  It is evident to me, Ma'am, now, that I
    have mistaken this bedroom for my own.  I had not been here five
    minutes, Ma'am, when you suddenly entered it.'

“How and what is the end? Look east, west, south, and north.”

There was not the least objection, doubtless, to the young man’s
slaughtering and appropriating to his own use any calf, fat or lean,
that he might happen to find upon the premises; but as no such animal
chanced at that time to be grazing on Mr Pecksniff’s estate, this
request must be considered rather as a polite compliment that
a substantial hospitality. It was the finishing ornament of the
conversation; for when he had delivered it, Mr Pecksniff rose and led
the way to that hotbed of architectural genius, the two-pair front.

‘The loss of their own good name,’ replied Monks. ‘So, by the same
rule, if a woman’s a party to a secret that might hang or transport
her, I’m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you
understand, mistress?’

‘Vell, then, wot do you say to some wittles?’ inquired Sam.

I told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my
interest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination, and
he would now understand that I requested him, if he pleased, to go
away immediately.

Without apology, I'll trace
      Our airy flight across the sea,
    Because at once we raised _ourselves_
      And public curiosity.

‘This,’ said the man: ‘I saw three boys: two others and the prisoner
here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman
was reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it
done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified
by it.’ Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy
book-stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the
exact circumstances of the robbery.

"This comes under seal, and therefore I shall be bold. You told my
brother Ledcate that my unreverend style might make you neglect me.
With what face could you do this, who know you owe me for all the
fortune, wit, and understanding that you have."

_Fred._ Then nothing more remains, but for the Court to pronounce
sentence, which is, that you be placed under the bonds of matrimony, at
such time and place as may suit your convenience. But, Madam Belle
Kemper and Ebenezer Scrooge, what have you to say in your defense.

It was raining heavily.  The child and her grandfather passed through a
dirty lane into a crowded street, where they stood for a few moments.
The throng of people hurried by, while the two poor strangers, stunned
by the bustle and noise, looked sadly on.

‘Does Pontefract still flourish, sir, upon the soil of England?’

‘It is Mrs Lammle,’ said the lady.

‘Why, to tell you the truth, Tom,’ replied his friend, ‘he is not always
so. If you’ll take my advice, you’ll avoid him as much as you can, in
the event of your encountering him again. And by no means, Tom--pray
bear this in mind, for I am very serious--by no means lend him money any
more.’

[Illustration: _"What's the fun?" said a rather tall thin young man_]

“In fact, Volumnia,” proceeds Sir Leicester, “it is not holding up a
good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you
have put to him. He is the best judge of his own responsibility; he
acts upon his responsibility. And it does not become us, who assist
in making the laws, to impede or interfere with those who carry them
into execution. Or,” says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly, for
Volumnia was going to cut in before he had rounded his sentence, “or
who vindicate their outraged majesty.”

‘What do you mean?’ asked Martin, with some scorn.

Rose nodded “yes,” for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
that she could not speak.

The captain rode away and gave the message.

“If you find people in my service who are not to be controlled, Mrs
Pipchin,” said Mr Dombey, turning back towards the fire, “you know what
to do with them, I presume. You know what you are here for? Take her
away!”

“No,” said Mr. Openshaw.  “Norah shall take care of the old lady as long
as she lives; and, after that, she shall either come and live with us,
or, if she likes it better, she shall have a provision for life—for your
sake, missus.  No one who has been good to you or the child shall go
unrewarded.  But even the little one will be better for some fresh stuff
about her.  Get her a bright, sensible girl as a nurse: one who won’t go
rubbing her with calf’s-foot jelly as Norah does; wasting good stuff
outside that ought to go in, but will follow doctors’ directions; which,
as you must see pretty clearly by this time, Norah won’t; because they
give the poor little wench pain.  Now, I’m not above being nesh for other
folks myself.  I can stand a good blow, and never change colour; but, set
me in the operating-room in the infirmary, and I turn as sick as a girl.
Yet, if need were, I would hold the little wench on my knees while she
screeched with pain, if it were to do her poor back good.  Nay, nay,
wench! keep your white looks for the time when it comes—I don’t say it
ever will.  But this I know, Norah will spare the child and cheat the
doctor if she can.  Now, I say, give the bairn a year or two’s chance,
and then, when the pack of doctors have done their best—and, maybe, the
old lady has gone—we’ll have Norah back, or do better for her.”

‘I’m wery much obliged to you, old gen’l’m’n,’ replied Sam, ‘for
consulting my conwenience, and I’m still more obliged to the other
gen’l’m’n, who looks as if he’d just escaped from a giant’s carrywan,
for his wery ‘andsome suggestion; but I should prefer your givin’ me a
answer to my question, if it’s all the same to you.--How are you, Sir?’
This last observation was addressed with a patronising air to Mr.
Pickwick, who was peeping through the front window.

‘It’s no great matter,’ he said, in answer to the locksmith’s
sympathising look, ‘a mere uneasiness arising at least as much from
being cooped up here, as from the slight wound I have, or from the loss
of blood. Be seated, Mr Varden.’

“Chops, do you think? Oh! Chops, eh?” Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes
again. “Well, sir, I suppose it is. But I should say their cook at
the Sol wanted a little looking after. She has been burning ’em, sir!
And I don’t think”—Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again and then
spits and wipes his mouth—“I don’t think—not to put too fine a
point upon it—that they were quite fresh when they were shown the
gridiron.”

“Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,” returns Mr. Bucket very seriously,
“I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit and prove
satisfactory to all. When I depict it as a beautiful case, you see,
miss,” Mr. Bucket goes on, glancing gravely at Sir Leicester, “I mean
from my point of view. As considered from other points of view, such
cases will always involve more or less unpleasantness. Very strange
things comes to our knowledge in families, miss; bless your heart,
what you would think to be phenomenons, quite.”

‘Why--why? Tell him that.’

Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and
following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected
grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.

Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him
for his recommendation—

But still Mrs. Nickleby, in reply to the significant looks of all about
her, shook her head as though to assure them that she saw nothing
whatever in all this, unless, indeed, it were a slight degree of
eccentricity. She might have remained impressed with these opinions
down to the latest moment of her life, but for a slight train of
circumstances, which, trivial as they were, altered the whole complexion
of the case.

And he had come abroad to be rid of his repudiated daughter for the rest
of his life.  And here he was.

‘The reason why I said afraid,’ returned John, ‘is, because we must
move.’

After they had gone a little way the cart stopped, and Peggotty came
running up, with a parcel of cakes and a purse for David. After giving
him a good hug, she ran off.

“Better—much better!” replied Oliver, hastily.

This address, pumped out apparently from Mr Pecksniff’s very heart,
brought the enthusiasm to its highest pitch. The pocket handkerchiefs
were waved again; the charity children were admonished to grow up
Pecksniffs, every boy among them; the Corporation, gentlemen with wands,
member for the Gentlemanly Interest, all cheered for Mr Pecksniff. Three
cheers for Mr Pecksniff! Three more for Mr Pecksniff! Three more for
Mr Pecksniff, gentlemen, if you please! One more, gentlemen, for Mr
Pecksniff, and let it be a good one to finish with!

‘I never meant, Kate,’ said Nicholas, tenderly, ‘I never meant to stay
among you; think better of me than to suppose it possible. I may turn my
back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?
We shall not forget each other apart, and better days will come when we
shall part no more. Be a woman, Kate,’ he whispered, proudly, ‘and do
not make me one, while HE looks on.’

Our meeting was not cordial. We had parted angrily on the last occasion;
and there was an air of disdain about her, which she took no pains to
conceal.

"I merely wanted to observe, my Lord," said the chemist, taking his
seat with great deliberation, "that I've left nobody but an errand-boy
in my shop. He is a very nice boy, my Lord, but he is not acquainted
with drugs; and I know that the prevailing impression on his mind,
is that Epsom salts means oxalic acid; and syrup of senna, laudanum.
That's all, my Lord." With this, the tall chemist composed himself
into a comfortable attitude, and, assuming a pleasant expression of
countenance, appeared to have prepared himself for the worst.

He was brooding in this chair, with his eyes cast down upon the ground,
when Mrs Gamp came in to tell him that the little room was ready. Not
being quite sure of her reception after interfering in the quarrel, Mrs
Gamp, as a means of interesting and propitiating her patron, affected a
deep solicitude in Mr Chuffey.

Oh, moralists, who treat of happiness and self-respect, innate in every
sphere of life, and shedding light on every grain of dust in God’s
highway, so smooth below your carriage-wheels, so rough beneath the
tread of naked feet, bethink yourselves in looking on the swift descent
of men who HAVE lived in their own esteem, that there are scores of
thousands breathing now, and breathing thick with painful toil, who in
that high respect have never lived at all, nor had a chance of life! Go
ye, who rest so placidly upon the sacred Bard who had been young,
and when he strung his harp was old, and had never seen the righteous
forsaken, or his seed begging their bread; go, Teachers of content and
honest pride, into the mine, the mill, the forge, the squalid depths of
deepest ignorance, and uttermost abyss of man’s neglect, and say can any
hopeful plant spring up in air so foul that it extinguishes the soul’s
bright torch as fast as it is kindled! And, oh! ye Pharisees of the
nineteen hundredth year of Christian Knowledge, who soundingly appeal
to human nature, see that it be human first. Take heed it has not been
transformed, during your slumber and the sleep of generations, into the
nature of the Beasts!

MY DEAR HENRY,

“I have not been well,” said Edith, shaking, and still looking at her
in the same strange way. “I have had bad dreams, my love.”

He drew her arm through his own, as he said it.

“I hope you don’t mean to say, sir,” said Mr. Giles, trembling, “that
he’s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I
wouldn’t cut a boy off, no, not even Brittles here, not for all the
plate in the country, sir.”

‘You took that for yourself my excellent friend,’ he said, ‘and may keep
it. I am neither a thief nor a receiver. Don’t show it to me. You had
better hide it again, and lose no time. Don’t let me see where you put
it either,’ he added, turning away his head.

‘Why should you stay with me?  My sister will miss you.  You are
everything to her.’

With these words she embraced me hastily, and went out of the room,
shutting the door after her. At first I was startled by so abrupt a
departure, and almost feared I had displeased her; but when I looked
into the street, and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise, and
drove away without looking up, I understood her better, and did not do
her that injustice.

He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full
four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo
ere he could hope to reach his place of destination. As this
consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a
little, and meditated upon his means of getting there. He had a
crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in
his bundle. He had a penny too--a gift of Sowerberry’s after some
funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily
well--in his pocket. ‘A clean shirt,’ thought Oliver, ‘is a very
comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so
is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles’ walk
in winter time.’ But Oliver’s thoughts, like those of most other
people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out
his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible
mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no
particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other
shoulder, and trudged on.

Master Harry starts up and looks at him. Looks at Cobbs, too. Such is
the honor of that mite, that he looks at Cobbs, to see whether he has
brought him into trouble.

CHAPTER 5. Paul’s Progress and Christening

‘Gentlemen,’ returned Dick, ‘I thank you.  Anybody in the helpless
state that you see me in, is naturally anxious.  Don’t let me interrupt
you, sir.’

The V.D.S.C.R.C. (or Very Dirty and Small Coal Railway Company) delivered
me close to my destination, and I soon found the Half-Time System
established in spacious premises, and freely placed at my convenience and
disposal.

Mr Dennis rolled lazily over upon his breast, and resting his chin upon
his hand in imitation of the attitude in which Hugh lay, said, as he too
looked towards the door:

“Yes, Noah, dear!” replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.

“It came to me, Bosh,” returned the gentleman.

_Lucy's Song._
    How beautiful at even-tide,                             23

_Mr. K._ Belle, I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.

‘Oh, decidedly,’ said Mrs. Tuggs.

“Well, little woman,” said he, shutting up his book, “if you have
accepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.”

‘Another!’ ejaculated the spinster. ‘Who?’

“Who washed them, and put those bandages where they were bruised and
cracked?” asked the Chemist, pointing to their altered state.

‘Oh! The old-fashioned fright!’ cried Merry, in a whisper. ‘Cherry my
dear, upon my word you must sit next him. I shall die outright if he
talks to me any more; I shall, positively!’ To prevent which fatal
consequence, the buoyant creature skipped out of her seat as she spoke,
and squeezed her sister into the place from which she had risen.

"Fie! fie!" lisped the West wind, an exquisite of the most exclusive
order. "If you persist, I shall positively arraign you at the bar of
good breeding and fashion."

“I think—my mind is much confused, but I think—it is equally true of
Mr. Jasper’s nephew, sir.”

In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately
beautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was
more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I
thought I saw Miss Havisham’s influence in the change.

Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs
of that particular species of humanity to which Miss Nancy belonged,
to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong
any conversation with her at present. With the view of diverting the
attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.

‘Weeks!’ said Mr. Pickwick in astonishment, and out came the note-book
again.

‘If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty--’ Harry began.

‘No,’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘He knows better. He knows me. Let him keep
away. I say let him keep away,’ said Mr. Creakle, striking his hand upon
the table, and looking at Mrs. Creakle, ‘for he knows me. Now you have
begun to know me too, my young friend, and you may go. Take him away.’

“Well then, as to Old Orlick, _he_’s a-going up town,” retorted that
worthy. “Two can go up town. Tain’t only one wot can go up town.

Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the
smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that
evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have you
never considered that he may be proud?”

‘Not far.’

“Glad to see you, sir. I congratulate myself on having the honour of
receiving you here for the first time.” Mr. Sapsea does the honours of
his house in this wise.

The famous chapter was all but begun now, and would have been quite
begun, but for the wind.  It was blowing stiffly from the east, and it
rumbled in the chimney and shook the house.  That was not much; but,
looking out into the wind’s grey eye for inspiration, I laid down my pen
again to make the remark to myself, how emphatically everything by the
sea declares that it has a great concern in the state of the wind.  The
trees blown all one way; the defences of the harbour reared highest and
strongest against the raging point; the shingle flung up on the beach
from the same direction; the number of arrows pointed at the common
enemy; the sea tumbling in and rushing towards them as if it were
inflamed by the sight.  This put it in my head that I really ought to go
out and take a walk in the wind; so, I gave up the magnificent chapter
for that day, entirely persuading myself that I was under a moral
obligation to have a blow.

‘Why, you don’t mean to say--’ began Toby, turning pale.

Mrs. Mann was also very cruel to the children. She would scold and beat
them and shut them up in the cellar and treat them meanly in many ways
when no visitors were there. But, when any of the men who had control or
visitors came around, she would smile and call the children "dear," and
all sorts of pet names. She told them if any of them should tell on her
she would beat them; and, furthermore, that they should tell visitors
that she was very kind and good to them and that they loved her very
much.

‘“If you’ll come to the Bower I’ve shaded for you,
     Your bed shan’t be roses all spangled with doo:
     Will you, will you, will you, will you, come to the Bower?
     Oh, won’t you, won’t you, won’t you, won’t you, come to the
          Bower?”’

‘Yes,’ replied Miss Witherfield, with a short cough.

This is not the time at which I am to enter on the state of my mind
beneath its load of sorrow. I came to think that the Future was walled
up before me, that the energy and action of my life were at an end, that
I never could find any refuge but in the grave. I came to think so, I
say, but not in the first shock of my grief. It slowly grew to that.
If the events I go on to relate, had not thickened around me, in the
beginning to confuse, and in the end to augment, my affliction, it is
possible (though I think not probable), that I might have fallen at once
into this condition. As it was, an interval occurred before I fully knew
my own distress; an interval, in which I even supposed that its sharpest
pangs were past; and when my mind could soothe itself by resting on
all that was most innocent and beautiful, in the tender story that was
closed for ever.

She told no one of her extremity, and wandered abroad in the day lest
she should be questioned by her only friend: for any help she received
from her hands, occasioned fresh disputes between the good woman and her
husband; and it was new bitterness to be the daily cause of strife and
discord, where she owed so much.

“Whether she will be fully sensible of the distinction conferred upon
her,” said Mrs Chick, in a lofty tone, “is quite another question. I
hope she may be. We are bound to think well of one another in this
world, and I hope she may be. I have not been advised with myself. If I
had been advised with, I have no doubt my advice would have been
cavalierly received, and therefore it is infinitely better as it is. I
much prefer it as it is.”

I must say that for a Queen who made all those fine speeches, of which
I have confessed myself to be rather tired, about living and dying a
Maiden Queen, Elizabeth was ‘going’ to be married pretty often. Besides
always having some English favourite or other whom she by turns
encouraged and swore at and knocked about—for the maiden Queen was very
free with her fists—she held this French Duke off and on through
several years. When he at last came over to England, the marriage
articles were actually drawn up, and it was settled that the wedding
should take place in six weeks. The Queen was then so bent upon it,
that she prosecuted a poor Puritan named Stubbs, and a poor bookseller
named Page, for writing and publishing a pamphlet against it. Their
right hands were chopped off for this crime; and poor Stubbs—more loyal
than I should have been myself under the circumstances—immediately
pulled off his hat with his left hand, and cried, ‘God save the Queen!’
Stubbs was cruelly treated; for the marriage never took place after
all, though the Queen pledged herself to the Duke with a ring from her
own finger. He went away, no better than he came, when the courtship
had lasted some ten years altogether; and he died a couple of years
afterwards, mourned by Elizabeth, who appears to have been really fond
of him. It is not much to her credit, for he was a bad enough member of
a bad family.

‘Yes to be sure,’ said Kit eagerly.  ‘You can bear me out in that, Sir?’

THE name of the public-house was the Pegasus’s Arms.  The Pegasus’s legs
might have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse
upon the sign-board, the Pegasus’s Arms was inscribed in Roman letters.
Beneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll, the painter had
touched off the lines:

[Sidenote: Mr. Charles Knight.]

They had hardly come to us, when I heard, above all the other noises, a
tremendous cry of women's voices.  I also saw Miss Maryon, with quite a
new face, suddenly clap her two hands over Mrs. Fisher's eyes.  I looked
towards the silver-house, and saw Mrs. Venning--standing upright on the
top of the steps of the trench, with her gray hair and her dark eyes--hide
her daughter's child behind her, among the folds of her dress, strike a
pirate with her other hand, and fall, shot by his pistol.

In the following year Lord Bath died, and left Mr. Colman a very
comfortable annuity, but less in value than he had anticipated. In
1767, General Pulteney, Lord Bath's successor, died, and left him a
second annuity, which secured him in independence for life. And here it
may be proper to notice a subject which George Colman the younger has
touched before in his "Random Records," in which he corrects a hasty and
incautious error of the late Margravine of Anspach, committed by her, in
her "Memoirs." Speaking of George Colman the elder, she says,

‘I wouldn’t trust ’em myself,’ said the virulent old man.

Sophy tripped away, and we heard her received in the adjoining room with
a peal of laughter.

Though he lived and died among us,
Yet his name may be enrolled
With the knights whose deeds of daring
Ancient chronicles have told.

“Why?” asked Paul.

With the letter to Mr. Forster we give, as a note, a letter which Baron
Taüchnitz published in his edition of Mr. Forster's "Life of Oliver
Goldsmith."

‘Oh! I am very well,’ replied Mr Merdle, after deliberating about it. ‘I
am as well as I usually am. I am well enough. I am as well as I want to
be.’

DAVID COPPERFIELD, with 60 Illustrations and a Portrait, cloth, 5s.

“See! There they are,” said Herbert, “coming out of the Tap. What a
degraded and vile sight it is!”

“Was he a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.

Chapter 76

Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
ground, like a distracted child.

FOOTNOTES:

“Ah! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!” said the beadle.

The lady was at the upper end of the room. As Mr. Pickwick bowed, he
took his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket, and put them on; a
process which he had no sooner gone through, than, uttering an
exclamation of surprise, Mr. Pickwick retreated several paces, and the
lady, with a half-suppressed scream, hid her face in her hands, and
dropped into a chair; whereupon Mr. Peter Magnus was stricken motionless
on the spot, and gazed from one to the other, with a countenance
expressive of the extremities of horror and surprise.

‘I’ll swear he is not,’ replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.

‘Then, when we have seen the two large churches yonder, what shall we do
next?’ said I.

‘What an impudent blunderer this fellow is,’ said Pott, turning from
pink to crimson.

“Yes, he is old; but what of that?  He is as hale, and bright, and
stately as ever.  You have seen him before?”

‘Ugh,’ said Ralph, turning away. ‘Then he has done nothing. Stay,’
he added, looking round again. ‘He broke a leg or an arm, or put his
shoulder out, or fractured his collar-bone, or ground a rib or two? His
neck was saved for the halter, but he got some painful and slow-healing
injury for his trouble? Did he? You must have heard that, at least.’

“Captain Gills,” says Mr Toots, “and Mr Sols, I am happy to inform you
that Mrs Toots has had an increase to her family.”

“O Christ! My children!” cried the mother, wildly, struggling forwards
and clasping one in her arms. “Nancy! Jane! But where is David? David!
David! Oh, where is David? Where is your brother?”

“Afraid!” murmured the crowd. “That’s a good ’un!”

‘No.  She hears voices in the air.’

The girl burst into a laugh, drew her shawl more closely round her, and
they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble; and, looking up in
her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly
white.

‘As I anticipated, the knobs of cheese were provided for the
passengers’ supper, and are now in course of consumption. Your readers
will be surprised to hear that Professor Woodensconce has abstained
from cheese for eight years, although he takes butter in considerable
quantities. Professor Grime having lost several teeth, is unable, I
observe, to eat his crusts without previously soaking them in his
bottled porter. How interesting are these peculiarities!’

‘I have thowt of that,’ he replied. ‘So ‘twould, sir, so ‘twould.’

"No, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Weller. "You astonish me, sir; he wos a clerk
in a Gov'ment office, sir."

‘Ah! something of that sort,’ replied Noah. ‘What do you think would
suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very
dangerous, you know. That’s the sort of thing!’

_Young Benson._      Hence away!

Oh thank GOD, all who see it, for that older fashion yet, of
Immortality! And look upon us, angels of young children, with regards
not quite estranged, when the swift river bears us to the ocean!

‘What do you say, Mr. Nickleby?’ inquired Miss Price.

‘Then to-morrow be it,’ said Jowl.  ‘A drop of comfort here.  Luck to
the best man!  Fill!’

"Sir," returned the old man, squeezing his little packet of snuff in his
hand, and turning upon his interrogator as if such questions hurt him,
"I am."

Mrs. Cannon of course fell into fits; Commodus Cannon cast his scratch
_jasey_ into the fire; some of the young ladies rushed out of the
room; others, in whom no rush had been left, drooped in or on various
supporting parts of the furniture. The _young men_, as his lordship had
dared to call Mr. Cannon's promising and amiable sons, bore the insult
with all the calm dignity of men wantonly offended; they only bit their
lips, turned pale and red, clenched their fists, and paced about the
room at the rate of fourteen miles per hour, while the words "young
men" were muttered and murmured in deadly indignation.

Staunch Cricket on the Hearth! Loyal Household Fairies!

CHAPTER XVIII -- HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY
OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS

What am I to do?  Even if I could have the bandy-legged baby knocked up
and brought here, I could offer him nothing but sherry, and that would be
the death of him.  He would never hold up his head again if he touched
it.  I can’t go to bed, because I have conceived a mortal hatred for my
bedroom; and I can’t go away, because there is no train for my place of
destination until morning.  To burn the biscuits will be but a fleeting
joy; still it is a temporary relief, and here they go on the fire!  Shall
I break the plate?  First let me look at the back, and see who made it.
COPELAND.

In Ratcliffe Highway there's an old marine store,
    And a great black doll hangs out at the door;
    There are rusty locks, and dusty bags,
    And musty phials, and fusty rags,
    And a lusty old woman, called Thirsty Nan,
    And her crusty old husband's a hairy-faced man!

‘Murdered!’ cried Dennis, sitting down upon a stool, and regarding her
with great favour. ‘Why, my dear, who’d murder sich chickabiddies as
you? If you was to ask me, now, whether you was brought here to be
married, there might be something in it.’

Ever, my dearest Macready,
                                       Your attached and affectionate.

‘He’s a bad ‘un,’ said John, wiping his eyes; ‘a very bad ‘un, is
schoolmeasther.’

‘You are quite right!’ exclaimed the other, exchanging looks with
Martin. ‘and I am quite wrong, Tom, I don’t know how the deuce we fell
on this unlucky theme. I beg your pardon with all my heart.’

It is a little church of great antiquity; there is reason to believe that
some church has occupied the spot, these thousand years or more.  The
pulpit was gone, and other things usually belonging to the church were
gone, owing to its living congregation having deserted it for the
neighbouring school-room, and yielded it up to the dead.  The very
Commandments had been shouldered out of their places, in the bringing in
of the dead; the black wooden tables on which they were painted, were
askew, and on the stone pavement below them, and on the stone pavement
all over the church, were the marks and stains where the drowned had been
laid down.  The eye, with little or no aid from the imagination, could
yet see how the bodies had been turned, and where the head had been and
where the feet.  Some faded traces of the wreck of the Australian ship
may be discernible on the stone pavement of this little church, hundreds
of years hence, when the digging for gold in Australia shall have long
and long ceased out of the land.

‘Thy little sister, Rachael, thou hast not forgot her.  Thou’rt not like
to forget her now, and me so nigh her.  Thou know’st—poor, patient,
suff’rin, dear—how thou didst work for her, seet’n all day long in her
little chair at thy winder, and how she died, young and misshapen, awlung
o’ sickly air as had’n no need to be, an’ awlung o’ working people’s
miserable homes.  A muddle!  Aw a muddle!’

As we arrive in the vicinity of Lincoln’s-inn-fields, Bedford-row, and
other legal haunts, we drop a great many of our original passengers,
and take up fresh ones, who meet with a very sulky reception. It is
rather remarkable, that the people already in an omnibus, always look
at newcomers, as if they entertained some undefined idea that they have
no business to come in at all. We are quite persuaded the little old
man has some notion of this kind, and that he considers their entry as
a sort of negative impertinence.

"Joe," said Mr. Snodgrass, advancing to the astonished youth, and
seizing his hand, "I didn't know you before. There's five shillings for
you, Joe!"

‘My dear Eugene, I am here.’

‘Yah!’ cried the dwarf.  ‘Never thinking of anybody but yourself--why
don’t you retrench then--scrape up, hoard, economise, eh?’

Captain Kedgick put a thumb and three fingers to each side of the
brim of his hat; lifted it a little way off his head; put it on again
carefully; passed one hand all down his face, beginning at the forehead
and ending at the chin; looked at Martin; then at Mark; then at Martin
again; winked, and walked out.

‘You don’t mean to say you weren’t down upon me?’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer,
shaking Mr. Winkle’s hand with friendly warmth.

‘People have to pay to see Wax-Work, my dear,’ returned her husband,
‘whereas (though you’d be cheap at the same money) the neighbours is
welcome to see YOU for nothing.’

"From the pen of my critic, sir," rejoined Pott, with dignity.

‘Your clothes will be looked after for you, too,’ said Mr. Murdstone;
‘as you will not be able, yet awhile, to get them for yourself. So you
are now going to London, David, with Mr. Quinion, to begin the world on
your own account.’

Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow
calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room,
quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little
gardens. There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.
Brownlow was seated reading. When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book
away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.
Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read
such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world
wiser. Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver
Twist, every day of their lives.

“I think I do,” said the gentleman, breaking silence. “I should by your
description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other,
though,—it may not be the same.”

‘No, no, no,’ said Venus fretfully. ‘I was down at the water-side,
looking for parrots brought home by sailors, to buy for stuffing.’

"It's the first time I've sat down quietly to-day, I declare," said Mrs.
Britain, taking a long breath, as if she had sat down for the night; but
getting up again immediately to hand her husband his tea, and cut him
his bread-and-butter; "how that bill does set me thinking of old times!"

‘Mr. Pickwick,’ said Mr. Dowler; ‘my friend, Angelo Cyrus Bantam,
Esquire, M.C.; Bantam; Mr. Pickwick. Know each other.’

‘_Half-past eleven_.

‘Perfectly well.’

[Sidenote: Mr. W. H. Wills.]

She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which
presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl, and then
bending them on the ground, tossed her head with affected carelessness
as she said,

‘Wery much obliged to you, old fellers,’ said Sam, ladling away at the
punch in the most unembarrassed manner possible, ‘for this here
compliment; which, comin’ from sich a quarter, is wery overvelmin’. I’ve
heered a good deal on you as a body, but I will say, that I never
thought you was sich uncommon nice men as I find you air. I only hope
you’ll take care o’ yourselves, and not compromise nothin’ o’ your
dignity, which is a wery charmin’ thing to see, when one’s out a-
walkin’, and has always made me wery happy to look at, ever since I was
a boy about half as high as the brass-headed stick o’ my wery
respectable friend, Blazes, there. As to the wictim of oppression in the
suit o’ brimstone, all I can say of him, is, that I hope he’ll get jist
as good a berth as he deserves; in vitch case it’s wery little cold
swarry as ever he’ll be troubled with agin.’

This remarkable appearance was succeeded by another of a precisely
similar description; then a fine vegetable marrow, of unusually large
dimensions, was seen to whirl aloft, and come toppling down; then,
several cucumbers shot up together; and, finally, the air was darkened
by a shower of onions, turnip-radishes, and other small vegetables,
which fell rolling and scattering, and bumping about, in all directions.

Once more Anielka was alone in the world. Despite all the honors and
blandishments of her position, the old feeling of desolateness came
upon her. The new shock destroyed her health. She was unable to appear
on the stage. To sing was a painful effort; she grew indifferent to what
passed around her. Her greatest consolation was in succoring the poor
and friendless, and her generosity was most conspicuous to all young
orphan girls without fortune. She had never ceased to love her native
land, and seldom appeared in society, unless it was to meet her
countrymen. If ever she sang, it was in Polish.

‘Afraid of me?’

There is a swarm of young savages always flitting about this same place,
creeping off with fragments of orange-chests, and mouldy litter—Heaven
knows into what holes they can convey them, having no home!—whose bare
feet fall with a blunt dull softness on the pavement as the policeman
hunts them, and who are (perhaps for that reason) little heard by
the Powers that be, whereas in top-boots they would make a deafening
clatter. These, delighting in the trembles and the horrors of Mr Dolls,
as in a gratuitous drama, flocked about him in his doorway, butted
at him, leaped at him, and pelted him. Hence, when he came out of
his invalid retirement and shook off that ragged train, he was much
bespattered, and in worse case than ever. But, not yet at his worst;
for, going into a public-house, and being supplied in stress of business
with his rum, and seeking to vanish without payment, he was collared,
searched, found penniless, and admonished not to try that again,
by having a pail of dirty water cast over him. This application
superinduced another fit of the trembles; after which Mr Dolls, as
finding himself in good cue for making a call on a professional friend,
addressed himself to the Temple.

Mrs Skewton heaved a gentle sigh, supposed to cast a shadow on the
surface of that dagger of lath, whereof her susceptible bosom was the
sheath: and leaning her head on one side, in the Cleopatra manner,
looked with pensive affection on her darling child.

‘What could the baron do? He called for the lady’s maid, and roared
for the doctor; and then, rushing into the yard, kicked the two Lincoln
greens who were the most used to it, and cursing the others all round,
bade them go--but never mind where. I don’t know the German for it, or I
would put it delicately that way.

The Child’s Story

"Ten, mother," said Maggy.

The stranger looked towards the old man, but he had turned away his
head.  Then he looked back to the slight, gentle figure of the child.
Alone!  In that gloomy place all the long, dreary night!

Having uttered these fragmentary observations, Newman dropped upon his
desk and began to write with most marvellous rapidity.

"Like myself, in the too high opinion you have of me, Agnes, I am
afraid," said I.

‘Indeed, my dear friend,’ said Mr Pecksniff, ‘you may well inquire.
The heart is not always a royal mint, with patent machinery to work its
metal into current coin. Sometimes it throws it out in strange forms,
not easily recognized as coin at all. But it is sterling gold. It has at
least that merit. It is sterling gold.’

“What room is this? Where have I been brought to?” said Oliver. “This
is not the place I went to sleep in.”

"Well, Bologna," said Grimaldi, with a triumphant air, "are you
satisfied?"

They jumped into the gig. "Give her her head, Tom," cried the host;
and away they went, down the narrow lanes; jolting in and out of the
cart-ruts, and bumping up against the hedges on either side, as if they
would go to pieces every moment.

"Ah, poor thing!" replied Mrs. Sanders.

As for the question--why a tail should be ridiculous?--it seems to me
one of considerable intricacy, and of the highest interest. Yes, Mr.
Editor, why _should_ tails be ridiculous? Coat-tails, pig-tails, all
tails whatsoever, are found to touch us with a sense of the jocose; nay,
your comet's tail itself is only a kind of _terrific absurdity_. I say,
therefore, without fear of contradiction, that there subsists in this
question a deep psychological truth, which demands the exploring hand of
philosophy; and if no better man will take the hint,--why, Mr. Editor,
I think I must myself present you, another time, with my ideas on this
subject, handling the matter in the Aristotelian mode, and dividing my
_tails_ into _heads_.

Smollett, Dickens on the works of, i. 356

As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day,
Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.

‘Why, look’ee, young gentleman,’ said Toby, ‘when a man keeps
himself so very exclusive as I have done, and by that means has a
snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it,
it’s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a
young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be
to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.’

There is little doubt that Mr. Weller would have carried his benevolent
intention into immediate execution, if a great noise, occasioned by
putting up the cups and saucers, had not very fortunately announced
that the tea-drinking was over. The crockery having been removed, the
table with the green baize cover was carried out into the centre of
the room, and the business of the evening was commenced by a little
emphatic man, with a bald head, and drab shorts, who suddenly rushed
up the ladder, at the imminent peril of snapping the two little legs
encased in the drab shorts, and said:

‘Ay?’ said Barnaby, in a frightened whisper.

But this tranquillity of his lordship was not to last. A couple of
Saints had been seriously offended; and we have all of us read at school
that celestial minds are by no means insensible to the provocations of
anger. There were those who expected that St. Bridget would come in
person, and have the friar up again as she did the sailor; but perhaps
her ladyship did not care to trust herself within the walls of Shurland
Castle. To say the truth, it was scarcely a decent house for a female
Saint to be seen in. The Baron's gallantries, since he became a widower,
had been but too notorious; and her own reputation was a little blown
upon in the earlier days of her earthly pilgrimage: then things were so
apt to be misrepresented: in short, she would leave the whole affair
to St. Austin, who, being a gentleman, could interfere with propriety,
avenge her affront as well as his own, and leave no loop-hole for
scandal. St. Austin himself seems to have had his scruples, though
of their precise nature it were difficult to determine, for it were
idle to suppose him at all afraid of the Baron's boots. Be this as it
may, the mode which he adopted was at once prudent and efficacious. As
an ecclesiastic, he could not well call the Baron out, had his boots
been out of the question; so he resolved to have recourse to the law.
Instead of Shurland Castle, therefore, he repaired forthwith to his own
magnificent monastery, situate just without the walls of Canterbury,
and presented himself in a vision to its abbot. No one who has ever
visited that ancient city can fail to recollect the splendid gateway
which terminates the vista of St. Paul's street, and stands there yet
in all its pristine beauty. The tiny train of miniature artillery which
now adorns its battlements is, it is true, an ornament of a later date;
and is said to have been added some centuries after by some learned
but jealous proprietor, for the purpose of shooting any wiser man than
himself who might chance to come that way. Tradition is silent as to any
discharge having taken place, nor can the oldest inhabitant of modern
days recollect any such occurrence. Here it was, in a handsome chamber,
immediately over the lofty archway, that the superior of the monastery
lay buried in a brief slumber snatched from his accustomed vigils. His
mitre--for he was a mitred abbot, and had a seat in parliament--rested
on a table beside him; near it stood a silver flagon of Gascony wine,
ready, no doubt, for the pious uses of the morrow. Fasting and watching
had made him more than usually somnolent, than which nothing could
have been better for the purpose of the Saint, who now appeared to him
radiant in all the colours of the rainbow.

"I shall not take the trouble to go to bed at all, now," said Vendale;
"sit here and keep me company, and welcome."

‘Of which,’ pursued the cherub, enjoining patience with his hand, ‘a
certain mercenary young person distantly related to myself, could not
approve? Am I leading up to it right?’

[Sidenote: Mrs. Procter.]

These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time
he sat alone, in the housebreaker’s room; and with them uppermost in
his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him,
of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.
There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability
to understand his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her
glance at parting showed _that_.

‘_Foul Deed_.

“How are you, Toots?” Sir Barnet would say, waving his hand from the
lawn, while the artful Chicken steered close in shore.

"Now I am free; and now I must tell you that, though I have returned
your bond, and sworn not to claim any part in you, I have not promised
you not to break your own neck; and that I shall do now, and upon this
very spot you shall die for having throttled me, and for having been
about to smother me."

‘I never told him so, sir,’ returned Oliver in amazement.

Mr Pecksniff smiled through his tears, and slightly shook his head. ‘You
are very good,’ he said, ‘thank you. It is a great happiness to me, Mrs
Todgers, to make young people happy. The happiness of my pupils is my
chief object. I dote upon ‘em. They dote upon me too--sometimes.’

Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
strong men besides the Cook.

I will only say that I have felt great interest in their design, which
embraces all sorts and conditions of actors from the first, and it has
been maintained by themselves with extraordinary perseverance and
determination. It has been in existence some years, but it is only two
years since they began to dine. At their first festival I presided, at
their second, Macready. They very naturally hold that if they could
prevail on you to reign over them now they would secure a most powerful
and excellent advocate, whose aid would serve and grace their cause
immensely. I sympathise with their feeling so cordially, and know so
well that it would certainly be mine if I were in their case (as,
indeed, it is, being their friend), that I comply with their request
for an introduction. And I will not ask you to excuse my troubling you,
feeling sure that I may use this liberty with you.

‘That, I have often told you I will not,’ said he.

Noting these circumstances, Mr Pecksniff, in the innocence of his heart,
applied himself to the knocker; but at the first double knock every
window in the street became alive with female heads; and before he could
repeat the performance whole troops of married ladies (some about to
trouble Mrs Gamp themselves very shortly) came flocking round the steps,
all crying out with one accord, and with uncommon interest, ‘Knock at
the winder, sir, knock at the winder. Lord bless you, don’t lose no more
time than you can help--knock at the winder!’

never Lost on earth, alive or dead, yet Found by numbers; bodiless
corpse; _The Victim of Improvement_, for ever to improve;--

The powdered-headed footman slammed the door very hard, and scowled
very grandly; but both the slam and the scowl were lost upon Sam, who
was regarding a mahogany umbrella-stand with every outward token of
critical approval.

‘Lord Frederick,’ said Sir Mulberry, ‘we are going Mrs. Nickleby’s way.
We’ll see her safe to the omnibus?’

Kit, however, fortunately for himself, was not learned enough or
contemplative enough to be troubled with presages of evil afar off,
and, having no mental spectacles to assist his vision in this respect,
saw nothing but the dull house, which jarred uncomfortably upon his
previous thoughts.  So, almost wishing that he had not passed it,
though hardly knowing why, he hurried on again, making up by his
increased speed for the few moments he had lost.

Mr. Tupman rang the bell, purchased the tickets, and ordered chamber
candlesticks. In another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely
arrayed in a full suit of Mr. Nathaniel Winkle's.

“How can he be anything else?” I said, answering for Trottle, who sat
obstinately silent.  “This time, Jarber, you have not only read us a
delightfully amusing story, but you have also answered the question about
the House.  Of course it stands empty now.  Who would think of taking it
after it had been turned into a caravan?”  I looked at Trottle, as I said
those last words, and Jarber waved his hand indulgently in the same
direction.

All this time the uncle was dolefully blowing his clarionet in the
corner, sometimes taking it an inch or so from his mouth for a moment
while he stopped to gaze at them, with a vague impression that somebody
had said something.

‘Our friends, Alfred and Sophronia,’ pursues Veneering the veiled
prophet: ‘our friends Alfred and Sophronia, you will be glad to hear, my
dear fellows, are going to be married. As my wife and I make it a family
affair the entire direction of which we take upon ourselves, of course
our first step is to communicate the fact to our family friends.’

Mrs Gamp shook her head mysteriously, and pursed up her lips. ‘There’s
fevers of the mind,’ she said, ‘as well as body. You may take your slime
drafts till you flies into the air with efferwescence; but you won’t
cure that.’

‘As nails,’ added Charley Bates.

"Mr. Murdstone!  Sir!" I cried to him. "Don't!  Pray don't beat me!  I
have tried to learn, sir, but I can't learn while you and Miss Murdstone
are by.  I can't indeed!"

"We are alone, Theodore," said my beloved; "tell me, I beseech you,
what is labouring on your mind. You have spoken strange things during
your sleep. You have declared that I had the power to restore you; can
I do this? Theodore, be candid! Were it to cost my life, I would gladly
lay it down to be of benefit to you."

‘Aha!’ said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting
every feature with a hideous grin. ‘Clever dogs! Clever dogs!
Staunch to the last! Never told the old parson where they were.
Never poached upon old Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn’t have
loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no!
Fine fellows! Fine fellows!’

God knows how like a child the memory may have been that was awakened
within me by the sound of my mother's voice in the old parlor, when I
set foot in the hall.

"Pooh!" said Bologna, with a contemptuous air, "I see you know nothing
of the law. There's not a squire in all England who has power to put us
in prison, merely because we have killed your pigeons, although we may
not have taken out certificates."

"Thank you, sir--thank you;" exclaimed Mrs. Bardell, hysterically. And
downstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.

But the very same advocates of the punishment of Death who contend, in
the teeth of all facts and figures, that it does prevent crime, contend
in the same breath against its abolition because it does not!  “There are
so many bad murders,” say they, “and they follow in such quick
succession, that the Punishment must not be repealed.”  Why, is not this
a reason, among others, _for_ repealing it?  Does it not go to show that
it is ineffective as an example; that it fails to prevent crime; and that
it is wholly inefficient to stay that imitation, or contagion, call it
what you please, which brings one murder on the heels of another?

Abetting myself in my idle humour, I closed my eyes, and recalled life on
board of one of those mail-packets, as I lay, part of that day, in the
Bay of New York, O!  The regular life began—mine always did, for I never
got to sleep afterwards—with the rigging of the pump while it was yet
dark, and washing down of decks.  Any enormous giant at a prodigious
hydropathic establishment, conscientiously undergoing the water-cure in
all its departments, and extremely particular about cleaning his teeth,
would make those noises.  Swash, splash, scrub, rub, toothbrush, bubble,
swash, splash, bubble, toothbrush, splash, splash, bubble, rub.  Then the
day would break, and, descending from my berth by a graceful ladder
composed of half-opened drawers beneath it, I would reopen my outer
dead-light and my inner sliding window (closed by a watchman during the
water-cure), and would look out at the long-rolling, lead-coloured, white
topped waves over which the dawn, on a cold winter morning, cast a level,
lonely glance, and through which the ship fought her melancholy way at a
terrific rate.  And now, lying down again, awaiting the season for
broiled ham and tea, I would be compelled to listen to the voice of
conscience,—the screw.

I.

‘Because, sir, I will be frank with you,’ she replied, ‘and own that my
father attributes my increased dislike of my cousin to a predilection
for your nephew.’

This was enough to irritate a gentleman with Mr. Pickwick’s sense of
propriety, but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation, for a
stage-coach full, inside and out, was meeting them at the moment, and
the astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced. The
congratulations of an Irish family, too, who were keeping up with the
chaise, and begging all the time, were of rather a boisterous
description, especially those of its male head, who appeared to consider
the display as part and parcel of some political or other procession of
triumph.

‘Well!’ said the cherub gaily, and not expressing disapproval, ‘when
you—when you come back from retirement, my love, and reappear on the
surface, I think it will be time to lock up and go.’

‘Still in the land of the living, sir,’ retorted Mrs Gamp. ‘And Mr
Chuffey may thank you for it, as many and many a time I’ve told him.’

When Harriet left the house, the driver of her hired coach, taking a
course that was evidently no new one to him, went in and out by
bye-ways, through that part of the suburbs, until he arrived at some
open ground, where there were a few quiet little old houses standing
among gardens. At the garden-gate of one of these he stopped, and
Harriet alighted.

I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,
where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every
half-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the
knives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the
Lord Mayor’s dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the time
in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of
dinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.

“Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?” said the doctor,
shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the
bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy’s
utmost acuteness. “Something may come of this before long.”

“In the back room up there. You can see the winder from this corner.
Up there! That’s where I see him stritched out. This is the
public-ouse where I was took to.”

_Duet (The Squire and Edmunds)._
    Listen, though I do not fear you,                       22

Hazlitt has well said that “There is no class of society whom so many
persons regard with affection as actors.  We greet them on the stage, we
like to meet them in the streets; they almost always recal to us pleasant
associations.” {263}  When they have strutted and fretted their hour upon
the stage, let them not be heard no more—but let them be heard sometimes
to say that they are happy in their old age.  When they have passed for
the last time from behind that glittering row of lights with which we are
all familiar, let them not pass away into gloom and darkness,—but let
them pass into cheerfulness and light—into a contented and happy home.

‘Margaret,’ said Fern, bending over her, and kissing her upon the brow:
‘I thank you for the last time.  Good night.  Good bye!  Put your hand in
mine, and tell me you’ll forget me from this hour, and try to think the
end of me was here.’

"I can't.  You don't know what you're talking about.  When you have once
gone into Society, you mustn't come out of it."

‘Are you hurt?’ said Tom. ‘I am very sorry. Lean on me for a moment.
You can do that without forgiving me, if you still bear me malice. But I
don’t know why; for I never offended you before we met on this spot.’

‘Ah! mercy indeed, ma’am,’ was the reply. I only hope this’ll teach
master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are
born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah!
He was all but killed, ma’am, when I come in.’

"Where is it?"

Janet was a pretty blooming girl, of about nineteen or twenty, and a
perfect picture of neatness. Though I made no further observation of
her at the moment, I may mention here what I did not discover until
afterwards, namely, that she was one of a series of protegees whom my
aunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in a renouncement
of mankind, and who had generally completed their abjuration by marrying
the baker.

CHAPTER XVI-ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIRST, CALLED LONGSHANKS

‘If we were in the country now,’ said the child, with assumed
cheerfulness, as they walked on looking about them for a shelter, we
should find some good old tree, stretching out his green arms as if he
loved us, and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep,
thinking of him while he watched.  Please God, we shall be there
soon--to-morrow or next day at the farthest--and in the meantime let us
think, dear, that it was a good thing we came here; for we are lost in
the crowd and hurry of this place, and if any cruel people should
pursue us, they could surely never trace us further.  There’s comfort
in that.  And here’s a deep old doorway--very dark, but quite dry, and
warm too, for the wind don’t blow in here--What’s that!’

Not a doubt of that, I thought.

“Charley, do you mean?”

"Why, the plain state of the case, Mrs. Micawber," said Traddles, mildly
breaking the truth to her, "I mean the real prosaic fact, you know--"

Hearing this adjuration, Mr. Squeers, who had been lingering in the
passage until such time as it should be expedient for him to enter and
he could appear with effect, was fain to present himself in a somewhat
undignified and sneaking way; at which John Browdie laughed with such
keen and heartfelt delight, that even Kate, in all the pain, anxiety,
and surprise of the scene, and though the tears were in her eyes, felt a
disposition to join him.

Job Trotter, abating nothing of his speed, ran up Holborn: sometimes
in the middle of the road, sometimes on the pavement, sometimes in the
gutter, as the chances of getting along varied with the press of men,
women, children, and coaches, in each division of the thoroughfare;
regardless of all obstacles, he stopped not for an instant until he
reached the gate of Gray's Inn. Notwithstanding all the expedition he
had used, however, the gate had been closed a good half-hour when he
reached it, and by the time he had discovered Mr. Perker's laundress,
who lived with a married daughter, who had bestowed her hand upon a
non-resident waiter, who occupied the one-pair of some number in some
street closely adjoining to some brewery somewhere behind Gray's Inn
Lane, it was within fifteen minutes of closing the prison for the
night. Mr. Lowten had still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of
the Magpie and Stump; and Job had scarcely accomplished this object,
and communicated Sam Weller's message, when the clock struck ten.

I felt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise: but even this
was not all, for Peggotty went on to say:

Bella kissed him. ‘And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity,
poor dear, that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at
home?’

‘Very,’ said the second.

Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy, with every eye in the court’s head upon
them, knock at the closed door of the late lamented’s house, in a
high state of popularity. But being contrary to the court’s
expectation admitted, they immediately become unpopular and are
considered to mean no good.

[Illustration: MR. GREWGIOUS EXPERIENCES A NEW SENSATION--Chap. xx.]

‘Then why don’t you send this new cove?’ asked Master Bates, laying
his hand on Noah’s arm. ‘Nobody knows him.’

‘Drowndead,’ said Mr. Peggotty.

‘No,’ replied Mr. Hopkins carelessly. ‘No, I should rather say he
wouldn’t. There must be a splendid operation, though, to-morrow--
magnificent sight if Slasher does it.’

“I should like to know, through you, exactly where she lives.”

“He’s a very nice old man, Ma’am,” he said. “He used to draw my couch.
He knows all about the deep sea, and the fish that are in it, and the
great monsters that come and lie on rocks in the sun, and dive into the
water again when they’re startled, blowing and splashing so, that they
can be heard for miles. There are some creatures, said Paul, warming
with his subject, “I don’t know how many yards long, and I forget their
names, but Florence knows, that pretend to be in distress; and when a
man goes near them, out of compassion, they open their great jaws, and
attack him. But all he has got to do,” said Paul, boldly tendering this
information to the very Doctor himself, “is to keep on turning as he
runs away, and then, as they turn slowly, because they are so long, and
can’t bend, he’s sure to beat them. And though old Glubb don’t know why
the sea should make me think of my Mama that’s dead, or what it is that
it is always saying—always saying! he knows a great deal about it. And
I wish,” the child concluded, with a sudden falling of his countenance,
and failing in his animation, as he looked like one forlorn, upon the
three strange faces, “that you’d let old Glubb come here to see me, for
I know him very well, and he knows me.”

‘To which I have reason to know,’ said Pott, looking towards Mr. Perker
for corroboration--‘to which I have reason to know that my article of
last Saturday in some degree contributed.’

After this desperate adjuration there was no refusing my aunt's request.

‘I did,’ replied Mrs. Maylie; ‘but, on reflection, I determined to
keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne’s opinion.’

"Oh, yes, I know, I am a great deal better," said Paul, "a very great
deal better. Listen, Floy; what is it the sea keeps saying?"

Mr Merdle intimated that Society was the apple of his eye, and that its
claims were paramount to every other consideration. Treasury moved
on, and Bar came up.

"For the matter o' that, Mas'r Davy," replied Ham, "all's told a'most in
them words, 'Em'ly, Em'ly, for Christ's sake have a woman's heart
towards me. I was once like you!' She wanted to speak to Em'ly. Em'ly
couldn't speak to her theer, for her loving uncle was come home, and he
wouldn't--no, Mas'r Davy," said Ham, with great earnestness, "he
couldn't, kind-natur'd, tender-hearted as he is, see them two together,
side by side, for all the treasures that's wrecked in the sea."

One of the pleasantest things in the world is going a journey; but I
like to go by myself. I can enjoy society in a room; but out of doors
nature is company enough for me. I am then never less alone than when
alone.

He stretched out his hand towards the curtains; but checked himself in
the very act of undrawing them, turned his back sharply on the bed, and
walked towards the chimney-piece, to see what things were placed on it,
and to try if he could keep the dead man out of his mind in that way.

‘Bella, my life,’ said John Rokesmith, touching her cheek, with a grave
smile, as she cast down her eyes and pouted again; ‘look at me. I want
to speak to you.’

As a much shorter man than the visitor, Mr Flintwinch was at the
physical disadvantage of being thus disagreeably leered at from a
height; and as he went first down the staircase, and was usually a
step or two lower than the other, this disadvantage was at the time
increased. He postponed looking at Mr Blandois again until this
accidental inequality was removed by their having entered the late Mr
Clennam’s room. But, then twisting himself suddenly round upon him, he
found his look unchanged.

"There an't a better spot o' ground in all Kent," said the hard-headed
man again, after a pause.

‘Make my compliments to Miss Wilfer, and say I am here now.’

I gave him a look, but no other answer; and, going to my good old
master, said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort and
encouragement. He put his hand upon my shoulder, as it had been his
custom to do when I was quite a little fellow, but did not lift his grey
head.

“Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.”

“Pooh! You speak of Mr. J----. Is he the owner of the house?”

At first Nicholas was disposed to give his uncle credit for some portion
of this bold attempt (which had so nearly proved successful) to carry
off Smike; but on more mature consideration, he was inclined to
think that the full merit of it rested with Mr. Squeers. Determined to
ascertain, if he could, through John Browdie, how the case really stood,
he betook himself to his daily occupation: meditating, as he went, on
a great variety of schemes for the punishment of the Yorkshire
schoolmaster, all of which had their foundation in the strictest
principles of retributive justice, and had but the one drawback of being
wholly impracticable.

I FIND MR. BARKIS "GOING OUT WITH THE TIDE"                    313

But all men can’t be gifted, Mr. Hood.  Neither scientific, literary, nor
artistical powers are any more to be inherited than the property arising
from scientific, literary, or artistic productions, which the law, with a
beautiful imitation of nature, declines to protect in the second
generation.  Very good, sir.  Then, people are naturally very prone to
cast about in their minds for other means of getting at Court Favour;
and, watching the signs of the times, to hew out for themselves, or their
descendants, the likeliest roads to that distinguished goal.

‘Kate has been well educated,’ sobbed Mrs. Nickleby. ‘Tell your uncle, my
dear, how far you went in French and extras.’

The mandate was obeyed, and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed
out, with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the other, in a
perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.

Ever, my dear Georgy, most affectionately yours.

[Footnote 8: Poe himself implies this when he says, in an earlier
passage of his essay on Hawthorne: "The Tale Proper" (i.e.,
short-story), "in my opinion, affords unquestionably the fairest field
for the exercise of the loftiest talent which can be afforded by the
wide domains of mere prose. Were I bidden to say how the highest
genius could be most advantageously employed for the best display
of its own powers, I should answer, without hesitation, in the
composition of a rhymed poem, not to exceed in length what might be
perused in an hour. Within this limit alone can the highest order of
true poetry exist. I need only here say, upon this topic, that in
almost all classes of composition the unity of effect or impression
is a point of the greatest importance. _It is clear_, moreover, _that
this unity cannot be thoroughly preserved in productions whose perusal
cannot be completed at one sitting_."]

‘Am I not dead?’

“I can’t see her face well,” whispered Noah. “She is looking down, and
the candle is behind her.”

Midnight Mishaps, 197.

“To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up
your loss at once, and don’t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It’s
time you were on the lay. Come! It’s near ten, and nothing done yet.”

‘Is that the woman?’ he asked, scarcely above his breath.

“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if you
will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange
coincidence.”

Another cheering passed between the rowers; and Randulph’s barge swept
over the sparkling waters to the stairs near Lambeth Palace, where he
and his companions disembarked.

‘Yes.’

Mr. Micawber sat in his elbow-chair, with his eyebrows raised; half
receiving and half repudiating Mrs. Micawber's views as they were
stated, but very sensible of their foresight.

John Jasper, on his way home through the Close, is brought to a
stand-still by the spectacle of Stony Durdles, dinner-bundle and all,
leaning his back against the iron railing of the burial-ground
enclosing it from the old cloister-arches; and a hideous small boy in
rags flinging stones at him as a well-defined mark in the moonlight.
Sometimes the stones hit him, and sometimes they miss him, but Durdles
seems indifferent to either fortune. The hideous small boy, on the
contrary, whenever he hits Durdles, blows a whistle of triumph through
a jagged gap, convenient for the purpose, in the front of his mouth,
where half his teeth are wanting; and whenever he misses him, yelps out
“Mulled agin!” and tries to atone for the failure by taking a more
correct and vicious aim.

Thus delightfully ushered in, the holidays began.  Five of the six pupils
kissed little Kitty Kimmeens twenty times over (round total, one hundred
times, for she was very popular), and so went home.  Miss Kitty Kimmeens
remained behind, for her relations and friends were all in India, far
away.  A self-helpful steady little child is Miss Kitty Kimmeens: a
dimpled child too, and a loving.

While they were in progress, Mr Quilp withdrew to the adjoining room,
and, turning back his coat-collar, proceeded to smear his countenance
with a damp towel of very unwholesome appearance, which made his
complexion rather more cloudy than it was before.  But, while he was
thus engaged, his caution and inquisitiveness did not forsake him, for
with a face as sharp and cunning as ever, he often stopped, even in
this short process, and stood listening for any conversation in the
next room, of which he might be the theme.

‘How can I say what I might have turned out myself, but for my back
having been so bad and my legs so queer, when I was young!’ the
dressmaker would go on. ‘I had nothing to do but work, and so I worked.
I couldn’t play. But my poor unfortunate child could play, and it turned
out the worse for him.’

“Did he though!” says Mr. Jobling.

Having put the letters in his book of fate and girdled it up again,
he unlocks the door just in time to admit his dinner, which is
brought upon a goodly tray with a decanter of sherry. Mr. Bucket
frequently observes, in friendly circles where there is no restraint,
that he likes a toothful of your fine old brown East Inder sherry
better than anything you can offer him. Consequently he fills and
empties his glass with a smack of his lips and is proceeding with his
refreshment when an idea enters his mind.

“You can talk as you eat, can’t you?” said Fagin, cursing his dear
young friend’s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.

“‘If you remember,’” said Carton, dictating, “‘the words that passed
between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.’”

Ralph looked at him more closely. Seeing that he was indeed greatly
excited, he faltered, and could not tell what to say or think.

I followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action of an arm
gesticulating, with the utmost passion and vehemence, “For God’s sake,
clear the way!”

“You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?” said the matron,
interposing, and returning as she spoke the searching look of Monks.

‘And don’t you think you must be a very wicked little child,’ said Miss
Monflathers, who was of rather uncertain temper, and lost no
opportunity of impressing moral truths upon the tender minds of the
young ladies, ‘to be a wax-work child at all?’

‘But I have ever,’ said Mr Pecksniff, ‘sacrificed my children’s
happiness to my own--I mean my own happiness to my children’s--and I
will not begin to regulate my life by other rules of conduct now. If you
can be happier at Mrs Todgers’s than in your father’s house, my dear, go
to Mrs Todgers’s! Do not think of me, my girl!’ said Mr Pecksniff with
emotion; ‘I shall get on pretty well, no doubt.’

Again, as my aunt looked quite convinced, I endeavoured to look quite
convinced also.

John nodded.

‘Among those who once had dealings with this man, gentlemen--that’s from
twenty to five-and-twenty years ago--there was one: a rough fox-hunting,
hard-drinking gentleman, who had run through his own fortune, and wanted
to squander away that of his sister: they were both orphans, and she
lived with him and managed his house. I don’t know whether it was,
originally, to back his influence and try to over-persuade the young
woman or not, but he,’ pointing, to Ralph, ‘used to go down to the house
in Leicestershire pretty often, and stop there many days at a time. They
had had a great many dealings together, and he may have gone on some
of those, or to patch up his client’s affairs, which were in a ruinous
state; of course he went for profit. The gentlewoman was not a girl,
but she was, I have heard say, handsome, and entitled to a pretty large
property. In course of time, he married her. The same love of gain
which led him to contract this marriage, led to its being kept strictly
private; for a clause in her father’s will declared that if she married
without her brother’s consent, the property, in which she had only some
life interest while she remained single, should pass away altogether to
another branch of the family. The brother would give no consent that the
sister didn’t buy, and pay for handsomely; Mr. Nickleby would consent to
no such sacrifice; and so they went on, keeping their marriage secret,
and waiting for him to break his neck or die of a fever. He did neither,
and meanwhile the result of this private marriage was a son. The child
was put out to nurse, a long way off; his mother never saw him but once
or twice, and then by stealth; and his father--so eagerly did he thirst
after the money which seemed to come almost within his grasp now,
for his brother-in-law was very ill, and breaking more and more every
day--never went near him, to avoid raising any suspicion. The brother
lingered on; Mr. Nickleby’s wife constantly urged him to avow their
marriage; he peremptorily refused. She remained alone in a dull country
house: seeing little or no company but riotous, drunken sportsmen.
He lived in London and clung to his business. Angry quarrels and
recriminations took place, and when they had been married nearly seven
years, and were within a few weeks of the time when the brother’s death
would have adjusted all, she eloped with a younger man, and left him.’

I wonder, is the Medicine Man of the North American Indians never to be
got rid of, out of the North American country?  He comes into my Wigwam
on all manner of occasions, and with the absurdest ‘Medicine.’  I always
find it extremely difficult, and I often find it simply impossible, to
keep him out of my Wigwam.  For his legal ‘Medicine’ he sticks upon his
head the hair of quadrupeds, and plasters the same with fat, and dirty
white powder, and talks a gibberish quite unknown to the men and squaws
of his tribe.  For his religious ‘Medicine’ he puts on puffy white
sleeves, little black aprons, large black waistcoats of a peculiar cut,
collarless coats with Medicine button-holes, Medicine stockings and
gaiters and shoes, and tops the whole with a highly grotesque Medicinal
hat.  In one respect, to be sure, I am quite free from him.  On occasions
when the Medicine Men in general, together with a large number of the
miscellaneous inhabitants of his village, both male and female, are
presented to the principal Chief, his native ‘Medicine’ is a comical
mixture of old odds and ends (hired of traders) and new things in
antiquated shapes, and pieces of red cloth (of which he is particularly
fond), and white and red and blue paint for the face.  The irrationality
of this particular Medicine culminates in a mock battle-rush, from which
many of the squaws are borne out, much dilapidated.  I need not observe
how unlike this is to a Drawing Room at St. James’s Palace.

‘On which you cried out, very loud, “Come in!”’ suggested Tom.

There is no doubt that these stringent powers were afterwards sadly
and frequently abused. Arrests on secret information--districts
unnecessarily proclaimed--suspected persons sent, without the shadow of
a trial, on board the fleet--military license--arbitrary impressment of
beasts of burden for baggage transport--abuse in billeting--a general
insolence in the soldiery,--all these formed constant subject for
complaint, and, unfortunately, it was seldom made without ample
provocation.

We have been in great distress, really in distress, at the non-arrival
of the _Caledonia_. You may conceive what our joy was, when, while we
were dining out yesterday, H. arrived with the joyful intelligence of
her safety. The very news of her having really arrived seemed to
diminish the distance between ourselves and home, by one half at least.

For my part, my curiosity and interest were at least equal to the
child’s, for child she certainly was, although I thought it probably
from what I could make out, that her very small and delicate frame
imparted a peculiar youthfulness to her appearance. Though more
scantily attired than she might have been she was dressed with perfect
neatness, and betrayed no marks of poverty or neglect.

As the goblin laughed he suddenly darted toward Gabriel, laid his hand
upon his collar, and sank with him through the earth. And when he had
had time to fetch his breath he found himself in what appeared to be a
large cavern, surrounded on all sides by goblins ugly and grim.

We walked on, farther than we had walked yet, before he spoke again. He
was not crying when he made the pauses I shall express by lines. He was
merely collecting himself to speak very plainly.

We might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was
quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short.

‘For good!’ Mr Wegg severely stipulated.

The secretary smiled again; laughed, indeed, this time; and said,
rubbing his nose slily with one end of the portfolio:

‘Still,’ resumed Miss Murdstone, ‘I found no proof until last night.
It appeared to me that Miss Spenlow received too many letters from her
friend Miss Mills; but Miss Mills being her friend with her father’s
full concurrence,’ another telling blow at Mr. Spenlow, ‘it was not
for me to interfere. If I may not be permitted to allude to the natural
depravity of the human heart, at least I may--I must--be permitted, so
far to refer to misplaced confidence.’

P.S.--Fourth edition of "Great Expectations" almost gone!

My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the
manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put it on
bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a discontented
fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly
supposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more.

"No, thank you," replied Mr. Winkle, hurriedly.

‘HE doesn’t,’ said Eugene. ‘But neither is his late partner, whom he
denounces, a prepossessing person. The firm are cut-throat Shepherds
both, in appearance. I should like to ask him one thing.’

*W. H. G. KINGSTON.*

"What do you want done?"

Mr. Crisparkle remonstrates: “No, no, no. Do not use such strong
words.”

The holy train that far had gone
      To meet the sacred relic,
    And now with joyous hymns came on,
      Most like a band angelic.

"This action, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, "is expected to come on on the
fourteenth of next month."

‘Let the young man swear to keep silence touching all he has seen and
heard, or he shall not quit this room alive,’ rejoined Travers.

‘Are you sure, John dear; are you absolutely certain in your innermost
heart of hearts—?’

You rows of houses! you window-pierced faÁades! you roofs!
     You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!
     You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!
     You doors and ascending steps! you arches!
     You grey stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!
     From all that has been near you I believe you have imparted to
       yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,
     From the living and the dead I think you have peopled your
       impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and
       amicable with me.

"'Never say it again,' says Mr. Magan; and on we rode, cheek by jowl,
talking of fairs, horses, and the coming election. Lord! nothing came
amiss to him: he was up to every thing, from _écarté_ to robbing the
mail-coach; and in politics so knowing, that one while I fancied him a
Whig, and at the next I would have given my book oath he was a black
Orangeman.

Surely there never was, in any other borough, city, or hamlet, in the
world, such a singular sort of a place as Todgers'. And surely London,
to judge from that part of it which hemmed Todgers' round, and hustled
it, and crushed it, and stuck its brick-and-mortar elbows into it, and
kept the air from it, and stood perpetually between it and the light,
was worthy of Todgers'.

‘Ye-es,’ said the other, turning full upon him. ‘If you had told him
who you were; if you had given him your card, and found out, afterwards,
that his station or character prevented your fighting him, it would have
been bad enough then; upon my soul it would have been bad enough then.
As it is, you did wrong. I did wrong too, not to interfere, and I
am sorry for it. What happened to you afterwards, was as much the
consequence of accident as design, and more your fault than his; and it
shall not, with my knowledge, be cruelly visited upon him, it shall not
indeed.’

‘She came’ said Tom, laying his hand upon the other’s arm, ‘for the
first time very early in the morning, when it was hardly light; and when
I saw her, over my shoulder, standing just within the porch, I turned
quite cold, almost believing her to be a spirit. A moment’s reflection
got the better of that, of course, and fortunately it came to my relief
so soon, that I didn’t leave off playing.’

‘My dear James,’ cried Mrs. Orange, who had been peeping about, ‘do look
here.  Here’s the supper for the darlings, ready laid in the room behind
the folding-doors.  Here’s their little pickled salmon, I do declare!
And here’s their little salad, and their little roast beef and fowls, and
their little pastry, and their wee, wee, wee champagne!’

"Whatever has happened," said Mrs. Bardell, "I always have said, and
always will say, that in every respect but one, Mr. Pickwick has always
behaved himself like a perfect gentleman. His money always was as good
as the bank: always."

The finger still was there.

[Sidenote: Mr. Mitton.]

"Yes, ma'am," answered Paul.

‘Thank you, ma’am,’ said Mr Pancks, ‘such is my endeavour.’

“No, no!” he replied earnestly; “with a pure and holy passion.”

No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.
Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick’s hint now.
I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to
the Crown.

"Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
    To amorous Phillida;"

Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.

"Two hundred and thirty!" said a small gentleman in spectacles, raising
himself on tip-toe to catch the auctioneer's eye.

‘Any trick is fair in love,’ said Jonas. ‘She may have thought I liked
her best, but you didn’t.’

However imperfectly those disturbances are set forth in the following
pages, they are impartially painted by one who has no sympathy with the
Romish Church, though he acknowledges, as most men do, some esteemed
friends among the followers of its creed.

‘You know how I am situated here, sir, and you know how I am situated
at home. I must speak to you for myself, since there is no one about
me whom I could ask to do so. It is not generous in you, it is not
honourable in you, to conduct yourself towards me as you do.’

Florence resolved, at last, to speak to Walter. She believed she knew
now what the cause of his estrangement was, and she thought it would be
a relief to her full heart, and would set him more at ease, if she told
him she had found it out, and quite submitted to it, and did not
reproach him.

“Well!” said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching
her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.

‘Who?’ demanded Sim, with some disdain.

Dickens, Kate, 127.

My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going
away. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back
of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder
day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I
could see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I
soon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the
matter, and fell asleep again.

‘I don’t remember his name, father.’

Full half an hour elapsed before the old man stirred, but at length he
turned himself in bed, and, though not yet awake, gave tokens that
his sleep was drawing to an end. By little and little he removed the
bed-clothes from about his head, and turned still more towards the side
where Mr Pecksniff sat. In course of time his eyes opened; and he
lay for a few moments as people newly roused sometimes will, gazing
indolently at his visitor, without any distinct consciousness of his
presence.

“I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers;
“but every man ought to know his own business best.”

[Footnote 32: A wicker boat covered with a horse-skin, much used by
these islanders.]

“Not go there? Certainly not, my dear Miss Summerson, most assuredly
not. Why SHOULD I go there? When I go anywhere, I go for pleasure. I
don’t go anywhere for pain, because I was made for pleasure. Pain
comes to ME when it wants me. Now, I have had very little pleasure at
our dear Richard’s lately, and your practical sagacity demonstrates
why. Our young friends, losing the youthful poetry which was once so
captivating in them, begin to think, ‘This is a man who wants
pounds.’ So I am; I always want pounds; not for myself, but because
tradespeople always want them of me. Next, our young friends begin to
think, becoming mercenary, ‘This is the man who HAD pounds, who
borrowed them,’ which I did. I always borrow pounds. So our young
friends, reduced to prose (which is much to be regretted), degenerate
in their power of imparting pleasure to me. Why should I go to see
them, therefore? Absurd!”

Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”

The Patriarch, approaching with his usual benignity, was surprised to
see Mr Pancks, but supposed him to have been stimulated to an immediate
squeeze instead of postponing that operation until Monday. The
population of the Yard were astonished at the meeting, for the two
powers had never been seen there together, within the memory of the
oldest Bleeding Heart. But they were overcome by unutterable amazement
when Mr Pancks, going close up to the most venerable of men and halting
in front of the bottle-green waistcoat, made a trigger of his right
thumb and forefinger, applied the same to the brim of the broad-brimmed
hat, and, with singular smartness and precision, shot it off the
polished head as if it had been a large marble.

“Well! a man, then, and he asks for you, and he rung at the front door
bell, and has walked into the dining-room.”

‘Nothing could be better,’ said the father-in-law, rubbing his hands.

"Why do I yield to that suggestion
    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,
    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
    Against the use of nature."

‘All in good time, young gentleman,’ replied Cardwell Fire-bras gravely.
‘Before I advert to my own concerns, let me say a word on yours. Answer
me truly--have you not conceived an affection for Hilda Scarve? Nay, you
need not answer. Your hesitation convinces me you have. Circumstances
led you into acting very injudiciously this morning at the Folly, and
I fear your conduct may have produced an unfavourable impression on
Hilda’s mind,--for I watched her closely. But heed not this. I will set
all to rights. I have much influence with her father. He designs her for
another--the apish gallant of the pretty actress who fascinated you this
morning. But you shall have her nevertheless,--on one condition.’

The Chamber of Torture!  And the roof was made of that shape to stifle
the victim’s cries!  Oh Goblin, Goblin, let us think of this awhile, in
silence.  Peace, Goblin!  Sit with your short arms crossed on your short
legs, upon that heap of stones, for only five minutes, and then flame out
again.

"The ribaldry of this miserable man is despicably disgusting," said
Pott, pretending to address Bob Sawyer, and scowling upon Slurk.

‘My honourable friend.’

_Scro._ Come on, then, we'll talk it over as we go. Come Tiny Tim, and
go with your Godfather. (_Takes Tim on his shoulder. Exeunt_, L.)

It was over.  It was over.  And this was she, her father’s pride and joy!
This haggard, wretched woman, weeping by the bed, if it deserved that
name, and pressing to her breast, and hanging down her head upon, an
infant.  Who can tell how spare, how sickly, and how poor an infant!  Who
can tell how dear!

"Oh yaas!" answered the Columbian; "but at first I declined off to buy
at a better lay; for arter higgling back and forth for a while, I give
the 'squire but twenty dollars in all, and he give me the nigger, Ivory
Whiteface there, besides. Sartain he was awful sharp to make an ugly
bargain; but if he _was_ the steel blade, I guess I was the unpierceable
di'mond; and, for fear he should squiggle, I got all set down in black
and white afore the authority, and a letter to Lawyer Sharples. Now I
calkilate to put up all at auction, and to sell some notions of my own,
what I've brought over in my plunder, to make more avails.--How do you
allot upon that?"

"Nay, Quilp, _good_ Quilp!" gasped the old man, extending his hands in
entreaty; "let me try just this once more.  I tell you it is not for
me--it is for _her_!  Oh, I cannot die and leave her in poverty!"

“Hush, dear! Again?” Lucie remonstrated.

I send a note to Katie (addressed to Mamie) by this mail. I wrote to
Harry some weeks ago, stating to him on what principles he must act in
remodelling the cricket club, if he would secure success.

“Show the way there!” Turning her eyes again on the attentive gentleman
at the bottom of the stairs, and informing him with a slight motion of
her head, that he was at liberty to follow, she passed on.

"Well!" said the first. "Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?"

The fat boy shook his head.

‘Nearer three, I think,’ said Trent.

"My life upon this globe, is very brief," replied the Ghost.
"It ends to-night."

“Not that claret!” he said. “Excuse me! This is an occasion, and ON
an occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.
(James, Captain Swosser’s wine!) Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that
was imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago. You
will find it very curious. My dear, I shall be happy to take some of
this wine with you. (Captain Swosser’s claret to your mistress,
James!) My love, your health!”

‘What have you got to say to me, afore I knock your head off?’ repeated
Mr. Weller, in a threatening manner.

_Spir._ I told you these were shadows of the things that have been.
That they are what they are, do not blame me.

“If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on both, I can give no
reason for it,” he went on, wiping the palms of his hands.  “I should get
into trouble, and do no good.  They would think I was mad.  This is the
way it would work,—Message: ‘Danger!  Take care!’  Answer: ‘What Danger?
Where?’  Message: ‘Don’t know.  But, for God’s sake, take care!’  They
would displace me.  What else could they do?”

"Know thyself," said the Pythian of old.  "That precept descended
from Heaven."  Know thyself!  Is that maxim wise?  If so, know thy
soul.  But never yet did man come to the thorough conviction of
soul but what he acknowledged the sovereign necessity of prayer.
In my awe, in my rapture, all my thoughts seemed enlarged and
illumed and exalted.  I prayed--all my soul seemed one prayer.  All
my past, with its pride and presumption and folly, grew distinct as
the form of a penitent, kneeling for pardon before setting forth on
the pilgrimage vowed to a shrine.  And, sure now, in the deeps of a
soul first revealed to myself, that the Dead do not die forever, my
human love soared beyond its brief trial of terror and sorrow.
Daring not to ask from Heaven's wisdom that Lilian, for my sake,
might not yet pass away from the earth, I prayed that my soul might
be fitted to bear with submission whatever my Maker might ordain.
And if surviving her--without whom no beam from yon material sun
could ever warm into joy a morrow in human life--so to guide my
steps that they might rejoin her at last, and in rejoining, regain
forever!

All was now stupefaction.

‘On foot?’ asked Miss Wren, with a chop.

‘Then, I have got it, boy!’ said Mr. Dick. And he stood up before me,
more exultingly than before, nodding his head, and striking himself
repeatedly upon the breast, until one might have supposed that he had
nearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body.

Mr. Barker had not officiated for many months in this capacity, when
the appearance of the first omnibus caused the public mind to go in a
new direction, and prevented a great many hackney-coaches from going in
any direction at all. The genius of Mr. Barker at once perceived the
whole extent of the injury that would be eventually inflicted on cab
and coach stands, and, by consequence, on watermen also, by the
progress of the system of which the first omnibus was a part. He saw,
too, the necessity of adopting some more profitable profession; and his
active mind at once perceived how much might be done in the way of
enticing the youthful and unwary, and shoving the old and helpless,
into the wrong buss, and carrying them off, until, reduced to despair,
they ransomed themselves by the payment of sixpence a-head, or, to
adopt his own figurative expression in all its native beauty, ‘till
they was rig’larly done over, and forked out the stumpy.’

But we have acted at Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Edinburgh, and
Glasgow; and the business of all this--and graver and heavier daily
occupation in going to see a dying sister at Hornsey--has so worried me
that I have hardly had an hour, far less a week. I shall never be quite
happy, in a theatrical point of view, until you have seen me play in an
English version of the French piece, "L'Homme Blasé," which fairly
turned the head of Glasgow last Thursday night as ever was; neither
shall I be quite happy, in a social point of view, until I have been to
Rockingham again. When the first event will come about Heaven knows. The
latter will happen about the end of the November fogs and wet weather.
For am I not going to Broadstairs now, to walk about on the sea-shore
(why don't you bring your rosy children there?) and think what is to be
done for Christmas! An idea occurs to me all at once. I must come down
and read you that book before it's published. Shall it be a bargain?
Were you all in Switzerland? I don't believe _I_ ever was. It is such a
dream now. I wonder sometimes whether I ever disputed with a Haldimand;
whether I ever drank mulled wine on the top of the Great St. Bernard, or
was jovial at the bottom with company that have stolen into my
affection; whether I ever was merry and happy in that valley on the Lake
of Geneva, or saw you one evening (when I didn't know you) walking down
among the green trees outside Elysée, arm-in-arm with a gentleman in a
white hat. I am quite clear that there is no foundation for these
visions. But I should like to go somewhere, too, and try it all over
again. I don't know how it is, but the ideal world in which my lot is
cast has an odd effect on the real one, and makes it chiefly precious
for such remembrances. I get quite melancholy over them sometimes,
especially when, as now, those great piled-up semicircles of bright
faces, at which I have lately been looking--all laughing, earnest and
intent--have faded away like dead people. They seem a ghostly moral of
everything in life to me.

‘Hollo!’ responded that gentleman, looking over the side of the chaise
with all the coolness in life.

Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to
the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the
village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the
stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder
was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all
started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares
who could find a living there.

By some means or other, she had sprung such a leak, that no pumping would
keep her free; and what between the two fears that she would go down in
the harbour, and that, even if she did not, all the supplies she had
brought for the little colony would be destroyed by the sea-water as it
rose in her, there was great confusion.  In the midst of it, Captain
Maryon was heard hailing from the beach.  He had been carried down in his
hammock, and looked very bad; but he insisted on being stood there on his
feet; and I saw him, myself, come off in the boat, sitting upright in the
stern-sheets, as if nothing was wrong with him.

"Oh! a great number."

As another exception to the above reasoning, I should not feel
confident in venturing on a journey in a foreign country without
a companion. I should want at intervals to hear the sound of my
own language. There is an involuntary antipathy in the mind of an
Englishman to foreign manners and notions that requires the assistance
of social sympathy to carry it off. As the distance from home
increases, this relief, which was at first a luxury, becomes a passion
and an appetite. A person would almost feel stifled to find himself in
the deserts of Arabia without friends and countrymen: there must be
allowed to be something in the view of Athens or old Rome that claims
the utterance of speech; and I own that the Pyramids are too mighty for
any single contemplation. In such situations, so opposite to all one's
ordinary train of ideas, one seems a species by one's self, a limb
torn off from society, unless one can meet with instant fellowship and
support.

"Well, that is odd," said Sam; "it 'ud have a wery considerable effect
upon me, if I wos in his place; I know that."

That night Mrs. Leigh stopped at home; that only night for many months.
Even Tom, the scholar, looked up from his books in amazement; but then
he remembered that Will had not been well, and that his mother’s
attention having been called to the circumstance, it was only natural
she should stay to watch him. And no watching could be more tender, or
more complete. Her loving eyes seemed never averted from his face; his
grave, sad, care-worn face. When Tom went to bed the mother left her
seat, and going up to Will where he sat looking at the fire, but not
seeing it, she kissed his forehead, and said,

‘What’s the next?’ inquired Peg.

"I say!" said Sam, "I'll trouble you, my friend! None o' that!"

Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,
or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing,
though the latter accident was very scarce,—anything approaching to
a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm,—the jury would take
it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners
would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance: but these
impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and
the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the
body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the
latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted, which was
very self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to
the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were
going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when _they_ went;
and what more would the people have?

Without disclosing the precise nature of the documents that had fallen
into Rigaud’s hands, Little Dorrit had confided the general outline of
that story to Mr Meagles, to whom she had also recounted his fate. The
old cautious habits of the scales and scoop at once showed Mr Meagles
the importance of recovering the original papers; wherefore he wrote
back to Little Dorrit, strongly confirming her in the solicitude she
expressed on that head, and adding that he would not come over to
England ‘without making some attempt to trace them out.’

Mr. Blotton was ejected but not conquered. He also wrote a pamphlet,
addressed to the seventeen learned societies, native and foreign,
containing a repetition of the statement he had already made, and rather
more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned
societies were so many ‘humbugs.’ Hereupon, the virtuous indignation of
the seventeen learned societies being roused, several fresh pamphlets
appeared; the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native
learned societies; the native learned societies translated the pamphlets
of the foreign learned societies into English; the foreign learned
societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into
all sorts of languages; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific
discussion so well known to all men, as the Pickwick controversy.

Tom Pinch and Ruth were sitting at their early breakfast, with the
window open, and a row of the freshest little plants ranged before it
on the inside by Ruth’s own hands; and Ruth had fastened a sprig of
geranium in Tom’s button-hole, to make him very smart and summer-like
for the day (it was obliged to be fastened in, or that dear old Tom
was certain to lose it); and people were crying flowers up and down the
street; and a blundering bee, who had got himself in between the
two sashes of the window, was bruising his head against the glass,
endeavouring to force himself out into the fine morning, and considering
himself enchanted because he couldn’t do it; and the morning was as fine
a morning as ever was seen; and the fragrant air was kissing Ruth and
rustling about Tom, as if it said, ‘how are you, my dears; I came all
this way on purpose to salute you;’ and it was one of those glad times
when we form, or ought to form, the wish that every one on earth were
able to be happy, and catching glimpses of the summer of the heart, to
feel the beauty of the summer of the year.

CHAPTER 33. — BLISSFUL

The Self-Supporting Cooking Depôt (not a very good name, and one would
rather give it an English one) had hired a newly-built warehouse that it
found to let; therefore it was not established in premises specially
designed for the purpose.  But, at a small cost they were exceedingly
well adapted to the purpose: being light, well ventilated, clean, and
cheerful.  They consisted of three large rooms.  That on the basement
story was the kitchen; that on the ground floor was the general
dining-room; that on the floor above was the Upper Room referred to in
the hand-bill, where the Public Dinner at fourpence-halfpenny a head was
provided every day.  The cooking was done, with much economy of space and
fuel, by American cooking-stoves, and by young women not previously,
brought up as cooks; the walls and pillars of the two dining-rooms were
agreeably brightened with ornamental colours; the tables were capable of
accommodating six or eight persons each; the attendants were all young
women, becomingly and neatly dressed, and dressed alike.  I think the
whole staff was female, with the exception of the steward or manager.

“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them
caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”

"My dear sir," said the good-humoured little Doctor, advancing with
extended hand, "I honour your gallantry. Permit me to say, sir, that I
highly admire your conduct, and extremely regret having caused you the
inconvenience of this meeting, to no purpose."

I think continually about my age. Say I am seventeen, and say that
seventeen is young for the eldest Miss Larkins, what of that? Besides,
I shall be one-and-twenty in no time almost. I regularly take walks
outside Mr. Larkins’s house in the evening, though it cuts me to the
heart to see the officers go in, or to hear them up in the drawing-room,
where the eldest Miss Larkins plays the harp. I even walk, on two or
three occasions, in a sickly, spoony manner, round and round the house
after the family are gone to bed, wondering which is the eldest Miss
Larkins’s chamber (and pitching, I dare say now, on Mr. Larkins’s
instead); wishing that a fire would burst out; that the assembled crowd
would stand appalled; that I, dashing through them with a ladder, might
rear it against her window, save her in my arms, go back for something
she had left behind, and perish in the flames. For I am generally
disinterested in my love, and think I could be content to make a figure
before Miss Larkins, and expire.

“And you will allow me, perhaps, to apologise, in his absence,” said Mr
Carker, taking off his hat, “for such a misadventure, and to wonder how
it can possibly have happened.”

To this indictment, Christopher Nubbles, in a low and trembling voice,
pleaded Not Guilty; and here, let those who are in the habit of forming
hasty judgments from appearances, and who would have had Christopher,
if innocent, speak out very strong and loud, observe, that confinement
and anxiety will subdue the stoutest hearts; and that to one who has
been close shut up, though it be only for ten or eleven days, seeing
but stone walls and a very few stony faces, the sudden entrance into a
great hall filled with life, is a rather disconcerting and startling
circumstance.  To this, it must be added, that life in a wig is to a
large class of people much more terrifying and impressive than life
with its own head of hair; and if, in addition to these considerations,
there be taken into account Kit’s natural emotion on seeing the two Mr
Garlands and the little Notary looking on with pale and anxious faces,
it will perhaps seem matter of no very great wonder that he should have
been rather out of sorts, and unable to make himself quite at home.

‘If it had been the commonest thing we do, and Mr Chuffey had been a
Bearer, gentlemen,’ said Mould, casting an imploring glance upon them,
as he helped to raise him, ‘he couldn’t have gone on worse than this.’

‘Please Heaven, there will be many such opportunities,’ said Mr.
Micawber. ‘The ocean, in these times, is a perfect fleet of ships; and
we can hardly fail to encounter many, in running over. It is merely
crossing,’ said Mr. Micawber, trifling with his eye-glass, ‘merely
crossing. The distance is quite imaginary.’

They arrived at last.  Going to see London was such an event to them,
that Mrs. Chadwick had made all new linen fresh for the occasion-from
night-caps downwards; and, as for gowns, ribbons, and collars, she might
have been going into the wilds of Canada where never a shop is, so large
was her stock.  A fortnight before the day of her departure for London,
she had formally called to take leave of all her acquaintance; saying she
should need all the intermediate time for packing up.  It was like a
second wedding in her imagination; and, to complete the resemblance which
an entirely new wardrobe made between the two events, her husband brought
her back from Manchester, on the last market-day before they set off, a
gorgeous pearl and amethyst brooch, saying, “Lunnon should see that
Lancashire folks knew a handsome thing when they saw it.”

* * * Her writings are equal to the best. She is a second Fanny
Fern.--_Palmyra Democrat._

"Come in," said a female voice. And in they went.

The miser made no reply. He was gazing listlessly into the fire, and
watching the wreaths of smoke ascend the chimney with childish delight.
Hilda, therefore, opened the letter, and found a small memorandum
enclosed in it, which she placed upon the table. Trembling with emotion,
she then began to read aloud the following lines:--

Mr Pecksniff pressed his hand. ‘We understand each other, my dear sir,
I see!--I can wind him,’ he thought, with exultation, ‘round my little
finger.’

Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were
married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
the young clergyman’s labours; on the same day they entered into
possession of their new and happy home.

‘If you don’t commit yourself by doing so, my dear Sir.’

The poor woman dried her tears, and heavily climbed into the gig,
expressing her gratitude in a very touching and modest manner. Spires
buttoned the apron over her, and taking a look at the child, said in a
cheerful tone to comfort her, “Bless me, but that is a fine thumping
fellow, though. I don’t wonder you are tired, carrying such a load.”

“You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to
propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our
good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
French.”

As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it
warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.

‘I suppose,’ said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, ‘you want to
know what you’re going to Bill’s for---eh, my dear?’

Then the boat came, and the convicts were taken back to prison, and Joe
carried Pip home.

‘“That Carpet Bag, with the representation of a green parrot on a stand,”
said I, “belongs to an English Jew, named Aaron Mesheck, and to no other
man, alive or dead!”

``````Take heed

In the civil court an action was trying, for damages sustained in some
accident upon a railway.  The witnesses had been examined, and counsel
was addressing the jury.  The learned gentleman (like a few of his
English brethren) was desperately long-winded, and had a remarkable
capacity of saying the same thing over and over again.  His great theme
was ‘Warren the ěn_gine_ driver,’ whom he pressed into the service of
every sentence he uttered.  I listened to him for about a quarter of an
hour; and, coming out of court at the expiration of that time, without
the faintest ray of enlightenment as to the merits of the case, felt as
if I were at home again.

"Small!" echoed Scrooge.

As the topic seemed exhausted, and Mr Merdle too, Fanny inquired if he
were going to take up Mrs Merdle and the carriage in his way home?

The next day--I forbear the horrors of that night--was a very foggy day
in our part of London, insomuch that it was necessary to light the Coffee-
room gas.  We was still alone, and no feverish words of mine can do
justice to the fitfulness of his appearance as he sat at No. 4 table,
increased by there being something wrong with the meter.

‘Aye! He is sharp enough,’ said Mr. Murdstone, impatiently. ‘You had
better let him go. He will not thank you for troubling him.’

"I understand you.  I will be a watchful and a faithful one."

"Hush!" said the lady. "My brother."

The way she learnt to understand any look of mine was truly surprising.
When I sold of a night, she would sit in the cart unseen by them outside,
and would give a eager look into my eyes when I looked in, and would hand
me straight the precise article or articles I wanted.  And then she would
clap her hands, and laugh for joy.  And as for me, seeing her so bright,
and remembering what she was when I first lighted on her, starved and
beaten and ragged, leaning asleep against the muddy cart-wheel, it give
me such heart that I gained a greater heighth of reputation than ever,
and I put Pickleson down (by the name of Mim's Travelling Giant otherwise
Pickleson) for a fypunnote in my will.

‘“Heyling!” said the old man wildly; “my boy, Heyling, my dear boy,
look, look!” Gasping for breath, the miserable father pointed to the
spot where the young man was struggling for life.

"Divil a taste," says Dick; "she's a Dawson, and there never was a
Dawson yet that did not know men must be men."

“‘Ho! ho!’ laughed Gabriel Grub, as he sat himself down on a flat
tombstone which was a favourite resting place of his and drew forth his
wicker bottle. ‘A coffin at Christmas—a Christmas Box. Ho! ho! ho!’

The summer and the autumn passed.  Christmas and the New Year were at
hand.

"You have played it, sir?" inquired Mr. Wardle, who had been much
amused by his loquacity.

‘Nor any one but these bloodhounds?’

Mr Montague was listening to, or, to speak with greater elegance, he
overheard, this dialogue. As soon as Jonas was gone he beckoned Nadgett
to him with the feather of his pen, and whispered in his ear.

The wretched King was running here and there, all this time, and never
getting anywhere in particular, until he gave himself up, and was taken
off to Kenilworth Castle. When he was safely lodged there, the Queen
went to London and met the Parliament. And the Bishop of Hereford, who
was the most skilful of her friends, said, What was to be done now?
Here was an imbecile, indolent, miserable King upon the throne;
wouldn’t it be better to take him off, and put his son there instead? I
don’t know whether the Queen really pitied him at this pass, but she
began to cry; so, the Bishop said, Well, my Lords and Gentlemen, what
do you think, upon the whole, of sending down to Kenilworth, and seeing
if His Majesty (God bless him, and forbid we should depose him!) won’t
resign?

‘Not been to bed, sir, since it began to get about. Been high and low,
on the chance of finding some hope of saving any cinders from the fire.
All in vain. All gone. All vanished.’

Well, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, as that favoured servitor entered his
bed-chamber, with his warm water, on the morning of Christmas Day,
‘still frosty?’

She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her eyes were
strained and sore, and she was very weak.  A curious passive inattention
had such possession of her, that the presence of her little sister in the
room did not attract her notice for some time.  Even when their eyes had
met, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes
looking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive
hand, before she asked:

When England thus became one kingdom, ruled over by one Saxon king, the
Saxons had been settled in the country more than four hundred and fifty
years. Great changes had taken place in its customs during that time.
The Saxons were still greedy eaters and great drinkers, and their
feasts were often of a noisy and drunken kind; but many new comforts
and even elegances had become known, and were fast increasing. Hangings
for the walls of rooms, where, in these modern days, we paste up paper,
are known to have been sometimes made of silk, ornamented with birds
and flowers in needlework. Tables and chairs were curiously carved in
different woods; were sometimes decorated with gold or silver;
sometimes even made of those precious metals. Knives and spoons were
used at table; golden ornaments were worn—with silk and cloth, and
golden tissues and embroideries; dishes were made of gold and silver,
brass and bone. There were varieties of drinking-horns, bedsteads,
musical instruments. A harp was passed round, at a feast, like the
drinking-bowl, from guest to guest; and each one usually sang or played
when his turn came. The weapons of the Saxons were stoutly made, and
among them was a terrible iron hammer that gave deadly blows, and was
long remembered. The Saxons themselves were a handsome people. The men
were proud of their long fair hair, parted on the forehead; their ample
beards, their fresh complexions, and clear eyes. The beauty of the
Saxon women filled all England with a new delight and grace.

The last words brought him round, and he took his hands of.  "I have seen
two of them within this minute," said I.  And so I told him what I had
told Harry Charker.

—Boffin, I’ll see you home.’

Faithfully your Friend.

‘You have forgotten me,’ said Newman, with an inclination of the head.
‘I wonder at that. That nobody should remember me who knew me in other
days, is natural enough; but there are few people who, seeing me once,
forget me NOW.’ He glanced, as he spoke, at his shabby clothes and
paralytic limb, and slightly shook his head.

The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion,
which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire, in the mingled pride and
diffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there
were anything to pay.

Grimaldi paid little attention to these circumstances at first; but
a change had come over the man which irresistibly attracted his
attention. He had become very violent and irritable,--had acquired a
nervous restlessness of manner, an occasional incoherence of speech,
a wildness of look, and betrayed many other indications of a mind
somewhat disordered. He dressed differently too: formerly he had been
neatly attired, and looked like a respectable, well-doing man; but now
he was showy and gaudy, wore a number of large rings and other articles
of cheap jewellery, and his desire to be thought a great man had
increased, greatly, so much so, indeed, that his declamations against
trade and all concerned in it, deeply affronted the worthies who were
wont to assemble at the Sir Hugh, and occasioned many disputes and
altercations.

‘What!’ cried the Jew, ‘alone?’

The triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself of
these words, had a powerful effect in alarming the mother; who cried
out, in much agitation:

‘I don’t doubt it.’

‘Well,’ returned his new friend, ‘if you ask me whether I came back here
with a greater relish for my country’s faults; with a greater fondness
for those who claim (at the rate of so many dollars a day) to be her
friends; with a cooler indifference to the growth of principles among
us in respect of public matters and of private dealings between man and
man, the advocacy of which, beyond the foul atmosphere of a criminal
trial, would disgrace your own old Bailey lawyers; why, then I answer
plainly, No.’

With that she began to bustle about most vigorously; presenting, as she
did so, an appearance sufficiently peculiar to justify a word of
introduction.

Mechanically I turned round the miniature to examine the back of it, and
on the back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the pentacle a
ladder, and the third step of the ladder was formed by the date 1765.
Examining still more minutely, I detected a spring; this, on being
pressed, opened the back of the miniature as a lid. Within-side the lid
were engraved, “Mariana, to thee. Be faithful in life and in death
to----.” Here follows a name that I will not mention, but it was not
unfamiliar to me. I had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as
the name borne by a dazzling charlatan, who had made a great sensation
in London for a year or so, and had fled the country on the charge of a
double murder within his own house,--that of his mistress and his rival.
I said nothing of this to Mr. J----, to whom reluctantly I resigned the
miniature.

‘I should think so myself, aunt, I am sure,’ said I.

‘One may do worse than that,’ said Nicholas. ‘I can rough it, I believe,
as well as most young men of my age and previous habits.’

“A moment!” cried Carker, interposing, “permit me! painful as my
position is, at the best, and unusually painful in seeming to entertain
a different opinion from you,” addressing Mr Dombey, “I must ask, had
you not better reconsider the question of a separation. I know how
incompatible it appears with your high public position, and I know how
determined you are when you give Mrs Dombey to understand”—the light in
his eyes fell upon her as he separated his words each from each, with
the distinctness of so many bells—“that nothing but death can ever part
you. Nothing else. But when you consider that Mrs Dombey, by living in
this house, and making it as you have said, a scene of contention, not
only has her part in that contention, but compromises Miss Dombey every
day (for I know how determined you are), will you not relieve her from
a continual irritation of spirit, and a continual sense of being unjust
to another, almost intolerable? Does this not seem like—I do not say it
is—sacrificing Mrs Dombey to the preservation of your preeminent and
unassailable position?”

Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to
express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with
his boot-cleaning.

But now Mr. Spenlow came out of the house, and Dora went to him,
saying, ‘Look, papa, what beautiful flowers!’ And Miss Mills smiled
thoughtfully, as who should say, ‘Ye Mayflies, enjoy your brief
existence in the bright morning of life!’ And we all walked from the
lawn towards the carriage, which was getting ready.

He went to the inn where he had waited for Martin, and briefly answering
their inquiries after Mr Pecksniff, ordered a bed. He had no heart for
tea or supper, meat or drink of any kind, but sat by himself before
an empty table in the public room while the bed was getting ready,
revolving in his mind all that had happened that eventful day, and
wondering what he could or should do for the future. It was a great
relief when the chambermaid came in, and said the bed was ready.

And the name "Ice-Heart" clung to her. In spite of all her royal
parents' commands to the contrary, "Princess Ice-Heart" she was called
far and near. It seemed as if people could not help it. "Sweet-Heart we
cannot name her, for sweet she is not," was murmured by all who came in
contact with her.

It was evident to me—and, I could see, to Trottle also—that we were not
dealing, to say the least, with a dishonest man.

GAD'S HILL, _Thursday, 16th April, 1867._

‘No, my dear, indeed! Let me explain to you what I mean.’

‘No offence intended, sir,’ urged Mark. ‘I don’t mean to say she was any
the happier without you; but I thought she was a-looking better, sir.’

The young Pariah seems pretty comfortable. He is of a cosmopolitan
spirit I hope, and stares with a kind of leaden satisfaction at his
spoons, without afflicting himself much about the established church.

"Well done, father!" said Sam; "take care, old fellow, or you'll have a
touch of your old complaint, the gout."

‘Is she quite recovered?’ said Nicholas, impetuously.

"It was all my jokes and nonsense," said the unscrupulous Sarah, "But
your ma wouldn't like to know I've said such a thing. And Master Robert
wouldn't be so mean as to tell tales, would he, love?"

"Sir,

*II.  OUT IN THE WIDE WORLD*

“The same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now,” said
Rose firmly. “If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose
goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should
I ever feel it as I should to-night? It is a struggle,” said Rose, “but
one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.”

Jack once had that bright clear eye of his on my sister; but, it fell out
that he married another lady and took her to South America, where she
died.  This was a dozen years ago or more.  He brought down with him to
our haunted house a little cask of salt beef; for, he is always convinced
that all salt beef not of his own pickling, is mere carrion, and
invariably, when he goes to London, packs a piece in his portmanteau.  He
had also volunteered to bring with him one “Nat Beaver,” an old comrade
of his, captain of a merchantman.  Mr. Beaver, with a thick-set wooden
face and figure, and apparently as hard as a block all over, proved to be
an intelligent man, with a world of watery experiences in him, and great
practical knowledge.  At times, there was a curious nervousness about
him, apparently the lingering result of some old illness; but, it seldom
lasted many minutes.  He got the Cupboard Room, and lay there next to Mr.
Undery, my friend and solicitor: who came down, in an amateur capacity,
“to go through with it,” as he said, and who plays whist better than the
whole Law List, from the red cover at the beginning to the red cover at
the end.

‘Gentlemen,’ said Mr Willet after a long pause, ‘you needn’t ask. The
likeness of a murdered man. This is the nineteenth of March.’

‘Of course,’ observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, ‘I knew he
was. A beadle all over!’

Silas Wegg, being on his road to the Roman Empire, approaches it by way
of Clerkenwell. The time is early in the evening; the weather moist and
raw. Mr Wegg finds leisure to make a little circuit, by reason that he
folds his screen early, now that he combines another source of income
with it, and also that he feels it due to himself to be anxiously
expected at the Bower. ‘Boffin will get all the eagerer for waiting a
bit,’ says Silas, screwing up, as he stumps along, first his right eye,
and then his left. Which is something superfluous in him, for Nature has
already screwed both pretty tight.

"What has ever got your precious father, then?" said Mrs. Cratchit. "And
your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by
half-an-hour!"

“It-can’t-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his
glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. “Can’t-be. Spoke good
French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”

Long before the close of this address, which we are bound to say was
of a very prosy character for Mr. Pickwick, the Serjeant had relapsed
into a state of abstraction. After some minutes, however, during which
he had reassumed his pen, he appeared to be again aware of the presence
of his clients; raising his head from the paper, he said, rather
snappishly,

"Heighday!" cried the master; "what have we here?"

“Dearest Leon, forgive me; let the past be forever forgotten. Return to
your Anielka. She always has been, ever will be yours.”

‘At your service, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping
outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat;
and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand
and a bundle in the other. ‘Shall I shut the door, ma’am?’

“Aha!” said the fat boy.

There are very few moments in a man's existence when he experiences
so much ludicrous distress, or meets with so little charitable
commiseration, as when he is in pursuit of his own hat. A vast deal of
coolness, and a peculiar degree of judgment, are requisite in catching
a hat. A man must not be precipitate, or he runs over it; he must not
rush into the opposite extreme, or he loses it altogether. The best
way is, to keep gently up with the object of pursuit, to be wary and
cautious, to watch your opportunity well, get gradually before it, then
make a rapid dive, seize it by the crown, and stick it firmly on your
head: smiling pleasantly all the time, as if you thought it as good a
joke as anybody else.

[Sidenote: Mr. Edmund Yates.]

CHEER. Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer
of mind or body to the multitude, a few of us are endeavouring to raise
a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We
choose this time because it is a time of all others, when want is keenly
felt and abundances rejoice. What shall we put you down for?

The American book (to begin with that) has been a most complete and
thorough-going success. Four large editions have now been sold _and paid
for_, and it has won golden opinions from all sorts of men, except our
friend in F----, who is a miserable creature; a disappointed man in
great poverty, to whom I have ever been most kind and considerate (I
need scarcely say that); and another friend in B----, no less a person
than an illustrious gentleman named ----, who wrote a story called ----.
They have done no harm, and have fallen short of their mark, which, of
course, was to annoy me. Now I am perfectly free from any diseased
curiosity in such respects, and whenever I hear of a notice of this
kind, I never read it; whereby I always conceive (don't you?) that I get
the victory. With regard to your slave-owners, they may cry, till they
are as black in the face as their own slaves, that Dickens lies. Dickens
does not write for their satisfaction, and Dickens will not explain for
their comfort. Dickens has the name and date of every newspaper in
which every one of those advertisements appeared, as they know perfectly
well; but Dickens does not choose to give them, and will not at any time
between this and the day of judgment. . . .

The Marquis of Granby in Mrs. Weller's time was quite a model of a
roadside public-house of the better class--just large enough to be
convenient, and small enough to be snug. On the opposite side of the
road was a large sign-board on a high post, representing the head and
shoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance, in a red
coat with deep blue facings, and a touch of the same blue over his
three-cornered hat, for a sky. Over that again were a pair of flags;
beneath the last button of his coat were a couple of cannon; and the
whole formed an expressive and undoubted likeness of the Marquis of
Granby of glorious memory.

‘Pardon me if I scarcely see, my dear Miss Podsnap,’ Mrs Lammle was
beginning when the young lady interposed.

‘Look at his togs, Fagin!’ said Charley, putting the light so close
to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. ‘Look at his togs!
Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game!
And his books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!’

To which the person of the house, stretching out her arm in an attitude
of command, replied with irresponsive asperity: ‘Go along with you! Go
along into your corner! Get into your corner directly!’

Boxer, by the way, made certain delicate distinctions of his own, in his
communication with Bertha, which persuade me fully that he knew her to be
blind.  He never sought to attract her attention by looking at her, as he
often did with other people, but touched her invariably.  What experience
he could ever have had of blind people or blind dogs, I don’t know.  He
had never lived with a blind master; nor had Mr. Boxer the elder, nor
Mrs. Boxer, nor any of his respectable family on either side, ever been
visited with blindness, that I am aware of.  He may have found it out for
himself, perhaps, but he had got hold of it somehow; and therefore he had
hold of Bertha too, by the skirt, and kept hold, until Mrs. Peerybingle
and the Baby, and Miss Slowboy, and the basket, were all got safely
within doors.

Whenever he fixed his attention or his eyes, it was only for a very
little while. He soon began to droop his head again, and roll it
heavily, and speak as if he were half awake.

During this dialogue the gentleman has been taking his brandy-and-water
on one side of the fire, and the lady, with her dressing-case on the
table, has been curling her hair on the other. She now lets down her
back hair, and proceeds to brush it; preserving at the same time an air
of conscious rectitude and suffering virtue, which is intended to
exasperate the gentleman—and does so.

"Ah!" said that gentleman, smacking his lips, "here's richness!  Think
of the many beggars and orphans in the streets that would be glad of
this, little boys.  A shocking thing hunger is, isn't it, Mr. Nickleby?"

‘In admirable spirits,’ returned Blandois. ‘Word of honour! never more
refreshed in spirits. Do you ever have presentiments, Mr Flintwinch?’

The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the
next door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked
up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his
face.

CHAPTER X.
           -"sh'is" used (could be "sh' is")

Again, another’s taste will lead him to the contemplation of Rienzi and
the streets of Rome; another’s to the rebuilt and repeopled streets of
Pompeii; another’s to the touching history of the fireside where the
Caxton family learned how to discipline their natures and tame their wild
hopes down.  But, however various their feelings and reasons may be, I am
sure that with one accord each will help the other, and all will swell
the greeting, with which I shall now propose to you “The Health of our
Chairman, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton.”

“Thank you. I might have known it from what I have seen of your
strength of character. I ought not to have asked the question, but I
have the habit of making sure of my ground, step by step, as I go on.
The sole consideration in this unhappy case is Sir Leicester.”

‘_I_ think it has passed very slowly,’ mildly suggested Tottle.

If I might offer any apology for so exaggerated a fiction as the
Barnacles and the Circumlocution Office, I would seek it in the
common experience of an Englishman, without presuming to mention the
unimportant fact of my having done that violence to good manners, in the
days of a Russian war, and of a Court of Inquiry at Chelsea. If I might
make so bold as to defend that extravagant conception, Mr Merdle, I
would hint that it originated after the Railroad-share epoch, in the
times of a certain Irish bank, and of one or two other equally
laudable enterprises. If I were to plead anything in mitigation of the
preposterous fancy that a bad design will sometimes claim to be a good
and an expressly religious design, it would be the curious coincidence
that it has been brought to its climax in these pages, in the days of
the public examination of late Directors of a Royal British Bank. But,
I submit myself to suffer judgment to go by default on all these counts,
if need be, and to accept the assurance (on good authority) that nothing
like them was ever known in this land.

He nodded gravely. “I was his heir, and this was his house, Esther.
When I came here, it was bleak indeed. He had left the signs of his
misery upon it.”

Mr. Nelson used vigorously his last opportunity of lecturing these
people. He had it all his own way, for the humility of the gypsies was
edifying. Woodruffe fancied he saw some finger-talk passing, the while,
though the gypsies never looked at each other, or raised their eyes from
the ground. Woodruffe had to remind the Director that the whistle of the
next train would soon be heard; and this brought the lecture to an
abrupt conclusion. On his finishing off with, “I expect, therefore, that
you will remember my advice, and never show your face here again, and
that you will take to a proper course of life in future, and bring up
your son to honest industry;” the woman, with a countenance of grief,
seized one hand and covered it with kisses, and the husband took the
other hand and pressed it to his breast.

‘And do not YOU say Amen, likewise?’

"She has been an angel, mother," returned Steerforth, "for a little
while; and has run into the opposite extreme, since, by way of
compensation."

DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Friday, Jan. 31st, 1851._

‘I went out in the dark.’

“Now,” I continued, softly, “I promised your father to befriend you, and
I am not a man to forget a promise.  But you must tell me the whole
simple truth.”

‘I am not angry, sir,’ said Mr Pecksniff, softly. ‘I can bear a great
deal from you. I will never contradict you, Mr Chuzzlewit.’

If she had had any doubt which was her own Jeremiah, it would have been
resolved by his impatience. He looked about him for an offensive weapon,
caught up the snuffers, and, before applying them to the cabbage-headed
candle, lunged at the sleeper as though he would have run him through
the body.

“Let me in! Let me speak to you! I am thankful—quiet—humble—anything
you like. But let me speak to you.”

The Captain, in his glazed hat, was standing over the fire, making his
morning’s cocoa, with that elegant trifle, his watch, upon the
chimney-piece, for easy reference during the progress of the cookery.
Hearing a footstep and the rustle of a dress, the Captain turned with a
palpitating remembrance of the dreadful Mrs MacStinger, at the instant
when Florence made a motion with her hand towards him, reeled, and fell
upon the floor.

Mr. Lovell, as Mrs. Markham had conjectured, was a man of good family,
but no fortune; he might have had a large one, could he have made up his
mind to marry Lady Elizabeth Wentworth, the bride selected for him by a
wealthy uncle who proposed to make him his heir; but preferring poverty
with Emily Dering, he was disinherited. He never repented his choice,
although he remained vicar of a small parish, and a poor man all his
life. The two children whom Mrs. Markham had seen, were the only ones
they had, and through the excellent management of Mrs. Lovell, and the
moderation of her husband’s desires, they had enjoyed an unusual degree
of happiness in this sort of graceful poverty, till the young Charles
and Emily were grown up, and it was time to think what was to be done
with them. The son had been prepared for Oxford by the father, and the
daughter, under the tuition of her mother, was remarkably well educated
and accomplished; but it became necessary to consider the future:
Charles must be sent to college, since the only chance of finding a
provision for him was in the Church, although the expense of maintaining
him there could be ill afforded; so, in order in some degree to balance
the outlay, it was, after much deliberation, agreed that Emily should
accept a situation as governess in London. The proposal was made by
herself, and the rather consented to, that, in case of the death of her
parents, she would almost inevitably have had to seek some such means of
subsistence. These partings were the first sorrows that had reached the
Lovells.

“Then I’ll pay,” says Mr. Guppy, “and we’ll go and see him. Small,
what will it be?”

“By this?” said Biddy.

“Good,” said Monks, regarding her attentively: “go on.”

“To beat up these quarters, Ma’am,” suggested Major Bagstock.

These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.
The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiosity,
opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led
them on, through dark and winding ways, to the cell.

[30] Of the Guild of Literature and Art.

‘Oh, Mr Rokesmith, don’t be hard with me, don’t be stern with me; be
magnanimous! I want to talk with you on equal terms.’

‘You needn’t take the trouble to make yourself plainer than you
are, ma’am, however,’ rejoined Miss Price, ‘because that’s quite
unnecessary.’

“What can I do—to—assist?” demands Sir Leicester in some
considerable doubt.

I have known a word more gentle
Than the breath of summer air;
In a listening heart it nestled,
And it lived for ever there.
Not the beating of its prison
Stirred it ever, night or day;
Only with the heart's last throbbing
Could it fade away.

"Well, I never!" cried Meg.

In secluded corners of the place of my seclusion, there are little shops
withdrawn from public curiosity, and never two together, where servants’
perquisites are bought.  The cook may dispose of grease at these modest
and convenient marts; the butler, of bottles; the valet and lady’s maid,
of clothes; most servants, indeed, of most things they may happen to lay
hold of.  I have been told that in sterner times loving correspondence,
otherwise interdicted, may be maintained by letter through the agency of
some of these useful establishments.  In the Arcadian autumn, no such
device is necessary.  Everybody loves, and openly and blamelessly loves.
My landlord’s young man loves the whole of one side of the way of Old
Bond-street, and is beloved several doors up New Bond-street besides.  I
never look out of window but I see kissing of hands going on all around
me.  It is the morning custom to glide from shop to shop and exchange
tender sentiments; it is the evening custom for couples to stand hand in
hand at house doors, or roam, linked in that flowery manner, through the
unpeopled streets.  There is nothing else to do but love; and what there
is to do, is done.

“Mrs. Corney, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time
with his teaspoon, “I mean to say this, ma’am, that any cat or kitten
that could live with you, ma’am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be
a ass, ma’am.”

‘Nothing but a portmanteau,’ said the landlord; ‘and very little in it.’

‘We’ll see that,’ cried Hugh, interposing, as the indignation of the
crowd again burst forth. ‘You fill a basket with the tools he’ll want,
while I bring him downstairs. Open the doors below, some of you. And
light the great captain, others! Is there no business afoot, my lads,
that you can do nothing but stand and grumble?’

“Yes, my Lady,” with a curtsey. “Down in Warwickshire. The morning
among the trees. When you wouldn’t give me nothing. But the gentleman,
he give me something! Oh, bless him, bless him!” mumbled the old woman,
holding up her skinny hand, and grinning frightfully at her daughter.

_Barnaby Rudge_, 35, 125, 130.

I have seen a love whose patience
Never turned aside,
Full of tender, fond devices;
Constant, even when tried;
Smallest boons were held as victories,
Drops that swelled the sea:
That I think was--Love of Power,
But not Love of me!

‘No. Pray don’t,’ Mr Boffin interposed.

“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy. “I should have written if I had thought
that.”

‘Well?’ said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only
been taking a casual look at the prospect; ‘and when do you expect--’

"Cow--cow--coward," hissed the Pirate-Colonel in my ear, and gave me
back the note.

"Why, so it is," said the officer, after a little consideration;--"so
it is, when you consider that they never talk without doing. But don't
be afraid, Mr. Grimaldi."

‘And so, Miss Wren,’ said Mr Eugene Wrayburn, ‘I cannot persuade you to
dress me a doll?’

‘The Princess had a secret?’ said Clennam, in some surprise. ‘What
Princess was that, Maggy?’

This was a politic stroke of the Kenwigses, because it made Mr. Lillyvick
the great head and fountain of the baby’s importance. The good gentleman
felt the delicacy and dexterity of the touch, and at once proposed the
health of the gentleman, name unknown, who had signalised himself, that
night, by his coolness and alacrity.

[35] Ben Love for Love.

‘Old Bounderby’s quite ready,’ said Tom.  ‘Time’s up.  Good-bye!  I shall
be on the look-out for you, when you come back.  I say, my dear Loo!
AN’T it uncommonly jolly now!’

‘All right,’ cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.

“Certain,” replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; “I
expected him here before now. If you’ll wait ten minutes, he’ll be——”

“Not personally, Esther,” said Miss Donny; “merely through his
solicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior
gentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his periods
quite majestic!”

"For Em'ly," he said, as he put it in his breast. "I promised, Mas'r
Davy."

"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure," said Fred, "and it
would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled
wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say 'Uncle Scrooge!'"

His supper, which was brought to him there, and spread upon the little
table where he had seen her working, diverted his attention. She sat at
his side as in the days that were gone, for the first time since those
days ended. They were alone, and she helped him to his meat and poured
out his drink for him, as she had been used to do in the prison. All
this happened now, for the first time since their accession to wealth.
She was afraid to look at him much, after the offence he had taken; but
she noticed two occasions in the course of his meal, when he all of a
sudden looked at her, and looked about him, as if the association were
so strong that he needed assurance from his sense of sight that they
were not in the old prison-room. Both times, he put his hand to his head
as if he missed his old black cap--though it had been ignominiously
given away in the Marshalsea, and had never got free to that hour, but
still hovered about the yards on the head of his successor.

CHAPTER I.
Five Years Later

‘Whatever he likes that’s present,’ rejoined Squeers, in a most unusual
burst of generosity.

‘Well?’

A fir tree grew near the house; and from this he broke a twig, which he
planted in the ground, saying: "This twig shall become a tree, and shall
bring forth fruit year by year for you."

Surely a dear Theatre, then?  Because there were in London (not very long
ago) Theatres with entrance-prices up to half-a-guinea a head, whose
arrangements were not half so civilised.  Surely, therefore, a dear
Theatre?  Not very dear.  A gallery at three-pence, another gallery at
fourpence, a pit at sixpence, boxes and pit-stalls at a shilling, and a
few private boxes at half-a-crown.

"You had better take Tom's cab," quoth the squire.

For some changes in the fortunes of my friends, I was prepared. My aunt
had long been re-established at Dover, and Traddles had begun to get
into some little practice at the Bar, in the very first term after my
departure. He had chambers in Gray's Inn, now; and had told me, in his
last letters, that he was not without hopes of being soon united to the
dearest girl in the world.

"You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow, I suppose?" said Mr. Jorkins;
when he had heard me, very restlessly, to an end.

[Illustration: KATE WALKED SADLY BACK TO THEIR LODGINGS IN THE
STRAND--Chap. x.]

"'Why not?' I asked, surprised.

"You'll provoke me to break your neck some day, you vagabond! Ride back
for your life, you omadhaun! and pay whatever he asks, and get me the
letter."--"Why, sir, I tell you he was sellin' them before my face for
fourpence a-piece."

His friend made no direct reply, but observed, after a few whiffs of his
cigar, ‘Don’t mistake the situation. There is no better girl in all this
London than Lizzie Hexam. There is no better among my people at home; no
better among your people.’

There was a shed in a field he passed that offered shelter for the
night. Before the door were three tall poplar trees, which made it very
dark within, and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He
_could not_ walk on till daylight came again, and here he stretched
himself close to the wall—to undergo new torture.

When the day broke he was shut up in his rooms again. He had meant to
go away today, but clung to this tie in the house as the last and only
thing left to him. He would go to-morrow. To-morrow came. He would go
to-morrow. Every night, within the knowledge of no human creature, he
came forth, and wandered through the despoiled house like a ghost. Many
a morning when the day broke, his altered face, drooping behind the
closed blind in his window, imperfectly transparent to the light as
yet, pondered on the loss of his two children. It was one child no
more. He reunited them in his thoughts, and they were never asunder.
Oh, that he could have united them in his past love, and in death, and
that one had not been so much worse than dead!

“They don’t use me well. They ain’t graceful to me. They puts me on the
mantel-piece when I won’t have in more Champagne-wine, and they locks me
in the sideboard when I won’t give up my property.”

"No, I ain't, sir," replied the fat boy, starting up from a remote
corner, where, like the patron saint of fat boys--the immortal
Horner--he had been devouring a Christmas pie: though not with the
coolness and deliberation which characterised that young gentleman's
proceedings.

Master Harry dresses himself quickly. His breast begins to swell when
he has nearly finished, and it swells more and more as he stands, at
last, a-looking at his father; his father standing a-looking at him,
the quiet image of him.

Scene opens, and discloses coals of fire, heaped up into form of
letters, representing the following inscription:

“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to
write, before I go to sleep.”

If the child himself could have awakened in the night, and seen,
gathered about his cradle-curtains, faint reflections of the dreams
that other people had of him, they might have scared him, with good
reason. But he slumbered on, alike unconscious of the kind intentions
of Miss Tox, the wonder of the Major, the early sorrows of his sister,
and the stern visions of his father; and innocent that any spot of
earth contained a Dombey or a Son.

‘Is fork, sir, fork,’ replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket. ‘You
are awake, sir?’

‘Marchioness,’ said Richard, passing his hand over his forehead and
turning suddenly round, as though the subject but that moment flashed
upon him, ‘what has become of Kit?’

[Sidenote: The Hon. Mrs. Watson.]

"Really, Citizen Captain," said his lordship, rather warmly, "you
worked the devil's traverse with a vengeance! Upon my word, you have
been a--ha, hem!--excuse my English blood. There's something yet to
come; pray proceed. One may gather a useful lesson even from--I beg
pardon--proceed."

Balzac's tale, Melmoth Reconciled, in Vol. IV., furnishes a
solution to the terrible problem which Maturin has stated in this
story.--EDITOR'S NOTE.

If Tottle had been a free agent, he would have allowed no one to leave
the room on any pretence, except himself. As it was, however, he was
obliged to look cheerful when Parsons quitted the apartment.

1.  MR. HOME IS SUPERNATURALLY NURSED

He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely
breathing, listened attentively.

The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.

Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building,
the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his
companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of
great admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being
shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed
like what they were.

The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity
and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection
he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of
water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a
familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes
that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some
brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have
awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.

"He found that the proportion of Robinson Crusoes to Philip Quarlls was
as four and a half to one; and that the preponderance of Valentine and
Orsons over Goody Two Shoeses was as three and an eighth of the former
to half a one of the latter: a comparison of Seven Champions with
Simple Simons gave the same result. The ignorance that prevailed, was
lamentable. One child, on being asked whether he would rather be Saint
George of England or a respectable tallow-chandler, instantly replied,
'Taint George of Ingling.' Another, a little boy of eight years old,
was found to be firmly impressed with a belief in the existence of
dragons, and openly stated that it was his intention when he grew up,
to rush forth sword in hand for the deliverance of captive princesses,
and the promiscuous slaughter of giants. Not one child among the number
interrogated had ever heard of Mungo Park,--some inquiring whether
he was at all connected with the black man that swept the crossing;
and others whether he was in any way related to the Regent's Park.
They had not the slightest conception of the commonest principles of
mathematics, and considered Sinbad the Sailor the most enterprising
voyager that the world had ever produced.

Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,
observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.
The bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver
Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for
signature and approval, that very afternoon.

Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,
and the cocked hat on the table.

Mr. Peggotty and Ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as I did, and
were ready with some supper and their hospitable faces to drive it away.
Little Em’ly came and sat beside me on the locker for the only time in
all that visit; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful
day.

And thus the poor fellows had, for a finish to their morning's labour,
a half-hour of the most overpowering exertion to which you can set
mortal man,--that of working at the chain-pumps. When Mr. Littlejohn
saw elderly Joseph Grummet stripped to the waist, the perspiration
streaming down him in bucket-fulls, and panting as it were for his very
life, he, the said Small Jack, very rightly opined that no milk would be
forthcoming next morning.

The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit, and became absorbed in it.

‘I know they will always keep _one_ till it’s found out,’ said
Monks.

* * *

I thanked him and said, No; but would he take no dinner himself?

Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic
vinegar--Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and
then went on to say, rather faintly:

There was the meat-pie of which the youth had spoken so feelingly, and
there were, moreover, a steak, and a dish of potatoes, and a pot of
porter.

These cases did not ALL occur, it will be seen, in territory actually
belonging to legalised Slave States, though most, and those the very
worst among them did, as their counterparts constantly do; but the
position of the scenes of action in reference to places immediately at
hand, where slavery is the law; and the strong resemblance between that
class of outrages and the rest; lead to the just presumption that the
character of the parties concerned was formed in slave districts, and

‘Are you faint?’ inquired the anxious Rachael.

‘He ought to have been, a many times,’ replied the jailer. ‘He has
been pretty well everywhere else. _I_ know him well, your worship.’

Todger’s was in high feather, and mighty preparations for a late
breakfast were astir in its commercial bowers. The blissful morning
had arrived when Miss Pecksniff was to be united in holy matrimony, to
Augustus.

Chapter 61

"Beneath a plain grave-stone, in one of the most peaceful and secluded
churchyards in Kent, where wild flowers mingle with the grass, and the
soft landscape around forms the fairest spot in the garden of England,
lie the bones of the young mother and her gentle child. But the ashes
of the father do not mingle with theirs; nor, from that night forward,
did the attorney ever gain the remotest clue to the subsequent history
of his queer client."

He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he
held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must
have fallen upon that conclusion.  Somehow or other, he had become
possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could
hardly be set forth in a tabular form.  Her capacity of definition might
be easily stated at a very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at
nothing; yet he was not sure that if he had been required, for example,
to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return, he would have
quite known how to divide her.

“Good-bye, dear John! In the evening, at the old time and place, I
shall meet you as usual on your way home. Good-bye.”

When war is afoot among the noble savages—which is always—the chief holds
a council to ascertain whether it is the opinion of his brothers and
friends in general that the enemy shall be exterminated.  On this
occasion, after the performance of an Umsebeuza, or war song,—which is
exactly like all the other songs,—the chief makes a speech to his
brothers and friends, arranged in single file.  No particular order is
observed during the delivery of this address, but every gentleman who
finds himself excited by the subject, instead of crying ‘Hear, hear!’ as
is the custom with us, darts from the rank and tramples out the life, or
crushes the skull, or mashes the face, or scoops out the eyes, or breaks
the limbs, or performs a whirlwind of atrocities on the body, of an
imaginary enemy.  Several gentlemen becoming thus excited at once, and
pounding away without the least regard to the orator, that illustrious
person is rather in the position of an orator in an Irish House of
Commons.  But, several of these scenes of savage life bear a strong
generic resemblance to an Irish election, and I think would be extremely
well received and understood at Cork.

It is like Edith.

“No!” replied the girl. “I have not done this for money. Let me have
that to think of. And yet—give me something that you have worn: I
should like to have something—no, no, not a ring—your gloves or
handkerchief—anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet
lady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good-night, good-night!”

‘Busy just now, Caleb?’ asked the Carrier.

"That," said Mrs. Micawber, "that, at least, is my view, my dear Mr.
Copperfield and Mr. Traddles, of the obligation which I took upon myself
when I repeated the irrevocable words, 'I, Emma, take thee, Wilkins.' I
read the service over with a flat-candle on the previous night, and the
conclusion I derived from it was, that I never could desert Mr.
Micawber. And," said Mrs. Micawber, "though it is possible I may be
mistaken in my view of the ceremony, I never will!"

“You are come again, Sir!” she said, faltering.

"She's gone into his seat," cried a girl in a shrill whisper.

‘Amen!’ cried Gashford with a solemn face.

Transcriber's Notes:

My answer is, I have described myself as a public character with a blight

“But, my dear,” said Sowerberry, “I want to ask your advice.”

‘Well!’ exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his
little charge a look of intense malignity. ‘Well! Of _all_ the
ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you
are the--’

"It's humbug still!" said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."

‘No doubt about it,’ returned Kit, with a serious look; ‘upon my word,
mother, I don’t think it was right to trust it to itself.  Somebody
ought to have gone with it, I’m afraid.’

‘Only hear him, how he braves it out!’ cried the young woman.

Received by two very intelligent gentlemen, brothers, and partners with
their father in the concern, and who testified every desire to show their
works to me freely, I went over the lead-mills.  The purport of such
works is the conversion of pig-lead into white-lead.  This conversion is
brought about by the slow and gradual effecting of certain successive
chemical changes in the lead itself.  The processes are picturesque and
interesting,—the most so, being the burying of the lead, at a certain
stage of preparation, in pots, each pot containing a certain quantity of
acid besides, and all the pots being buried in vast numbers, in layers,
under tan, for some ten weeks.

"Well," said the undertaker's wife, when Oliver had finished his supper,
which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of
his future appetite, "have you done?"

"I hope not," rejoined the old gentleman; "I do not think you ever
will. I have been deceived before, in the objects whom I have
endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you,
nevertheless, and more strongly interested in your behalf than I can
well account for, even to myself. The persons on whom I have bestowed
my dearest love lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness
and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin
of my heart, and sealed it up for ever on my best affections. Deep
affliction has only made them stronger; it ought, I think, for it
should refine our nature."

Here Mr. Pell shook his head and paused; on which, the elder Mr.
Weller, nudging his neighbour, as begging him to mark the attorney's
high connections, asked whether the duties in question produced any
permanent ill effects on the constitution of his noble friend.

‘To be sure!’ cried Firebras; ‘and we are about to drink the king’s
health--_over the water_. And now, gentlemen,’ he continued, filling
Randulph’s glass and his own, ‘fill, I pray you, to the brim.’

‘“Not quite so, Dick; if I am afraid of nothing else, I am afraid of
myself.”

Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and
was overcome with penitence and grief.

This, as I have mentioned, was Saturday night.  Being Saturday night, I
had accomplished but the half of my uncommercial journey; for, its object
was to compare the play on Saturday evening with the preaching in the
same Theatre on Sunday evening.

I am concerned to hear that you are ill, that you sit down before fires
and shiver, and that you have stated times for doing so, like the demons
in the melodramas, and that you mean to take a week to get well in.

‘Ha ha!’ roared the fellow, smiting his leg; ‘for a gentleman as ‘ull
say a pleasant thing in a pleasant way, give me Muster Gashford agin’
all London and Westminster! My lord an’t a bad ‘un at that, but he’s a
fool to you. Ah to be sure,--when I go out in state.’

“The time will come, my boy,” pursues the trooper, “when this hair of
your mother’s will be grey, and this forehead all crossed and
re-crossed with wrinkles, and a fine old lady she’ll be then. Take
care, while you are young, that you can think in those days, ‘I never
whitened a hair of her dear head—I never marked a sorrowful line in
her face!’ For of all the many things that you can think of when you
are a man, you had better have THAT by you, Woolwich!”

Here somebody cried out, "Shame, J. Steerforth! Too bad!" It was
Traddles; whom Mr. Mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his
tongue.

“George,” says Mr. Bagnet. “You know me. It’s my old girl that
advises. She has the head. But I never own to it before her.
Discipline must be maintained. Wait till the greens is off her mind.
Then we’ll consult. Whatever the old girl says, do—do it!”

Of her waving her little hand, and our going away once more. Of her
once more stopping, and looking back, and hurrying to Agnes, and giving
Agnes, above all the others, her last kisses and farewells.

‘THE PRESIDENT complimented the honourable member on the excellent
distinction he had drawn.  Several other Members, too, dwelt upon the
immense and urgent necessity of storing the minds of children with
nothing but facts and figures; which process the President very forcibly
remarked, had made them (the section) the men they were.

‘Five guineas a week, ma’am, _with_ attendance,’ replied the
lodging-house keeper. (Attendance means the privilege of ringing the
bell as often as you like, for your own amusement.)

‘Get on your bonnet,’ repeated Wardle.

In a third cell, was a tall, strong black, a burglar, working at his
proper trade of making screws and the like.  His time was nearly out.  He
was not only a very dexterous thief, but was notorious for his boldness
and hardihood, and for the number of his previous convictions.  He
entertained us with a long account of his achievements, which he narrated
with such infinite relish, that he actually seemed to lick his lips as he
told us racy anecdotes of stolen plate, and of old ladies whom he had
watched as they sat at windows in silver spectacles (he had plainly had
an eye to their metal even from the other side of the street) and had
afterwards robbed.  This fellow, upon the slightest encouragement, would
have mingled with his professional recollections the most detestable
cant; but I am very much mistaken if he could have surpassed the
unmitigated hypocrisy with which he declared that he blessed the day on
which he came into that prison, and that he never would commit another
robbery as long as he lived.

He laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for
anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.

‘May I ask what he is professor of?’ asked Martin.

"No, sir, David Copperfield," I said.

"That is why," he went on, and his manner seemed to give more
purpose to his speech than hitherto,--"that is why, so far as I am
concerned, I mean to shirk the responsibility and remain
unmarried."

‘Is he his own enemy?’ said I, sorry to hear this.

“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you what
passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.”

She saw that he was coming; and stopped him again. But she was very
nearly too late.

There was unquestionably a Chuzzlewit in the Gunpowder Plot, if indeed
the arch-traitor, Fawkes himself, were not a scion of this remarkable
stock; as he might easily have been, supposing another Chuzzlewit
to have emigrated to Spain in the previous generation, and there
intermarried with a Spanish lady, by whom he had issue, one
olive-complexioned son. This probable conjecture is strengthened, if not
absolutely confirmed, by a fact which cannot fail to be interesting
to those who are curious in tracing the progress of hereditary tastes
through the lives of their unconscious inheritors. It is a notable
circumstance that in these later times, many Chuzzlewits, being
unsuccessful in other pursuits, have, without the smallest rational
hope of enriching themselves, or any conceivable reason, set up as
coal-merchants; and have, month after month, continued gloomily to watch
a small stock of coals, without in any one instance negotiating with a
purchaser. The remarkable similarity between this course of proceeding
and that adopted by their Great Ancestor beneath the vaults of the
Parliament House at Westminster, is too obvious and too full of
interest, to stand in need of comment.

Transcriber’s note

‘My dear John,’ replied Dot, turning very red, ‘don’t talk about
honouring _me_.  Good Gracious!’

“I will try, sir, but I seem mad.”

"--And a bender?" suggested the clerical gentleman.

The professional business of Mr. Waterbrook’s establishment was done on
the ground-floor, and the genteel business (of which there was a good
deal) in the upper part of the building. I was shown into a pretty but
rather close drawing-room, and there sat Agnes, netting a purse.

TIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought
up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.
But, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying
seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only
stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity.

“And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?” inquired the old gentleman.

“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of _your_ no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”

The knight looked at him with a smile of far deeper meaning than
ordinary; and pointing to the old cupboard, followed him with his eyes
while he filled and drank a glass of liquor; and smiled when his back
was turned, with deeper meaning yet.

‘Hush, hush!’ said one of the women, stooping over her. ‘Lie down,
lie down!’

“I did.”

"Thanks to _me_!" pursued Guguste.

Men and Masters

Madame Rosa looked from one to the other as if they had been Aztecs or
Red Indians, or any other unusual specimens of humanity; then, utterly
unable to find any sort of answer to such sentiments, turned back to
the piano and rattled off a brilliant fantasia, which no one understood
and every one thought noisy.

“And treated undutifully enough, too, my good old creature, sometimes,
I assure you,” said Mrs Skewton, whimpering. “There! Shake hands with
me. You’re a very good old creature—full of what’s-his-name—and all
that. You’re all affection and et cetera, ain’t you?”

"'Why, what good Irish you have for a Northman!' replied Judy.

Veneering, M.P., on the right of Mrs Lammle; Twemlow on her left; Mrs
Veneering, W.M.P. (wife of Member of Parliament), and Lady Tippins on Mr
Lammle’s right and left. But be sure that well within the fascination of
Mr Lammle’s eye and smile sits little Georgiana. And be sure that
close to little Georgiana, also under inspection by the same gingerous
gentleman, sits Fledgeby.

‘You spoke,’ he resumed, as she raised her eyes to him again, ‘of your
first object.  I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?’

“I’ll say anythink as you say, sir, for I knows it’s good.”

She was going away, but I detained her. I clasped my arm about her
waist. "In the course of years!" "It is not a new one!" New thoughts and
hopes were whirling through my mind, and all the colors of my life were
changing.

“What is all this!” said Rose.

Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy, having taken their breakfast, step into
Lincoln’s Inn to take a little walk about the square and clear as

‘Out of the question. Nothing can be tided over now, Pancks. The sooner
the business can pass out of my hands, the better for it. There are
engagements to be met, this week, which would bring the catastrophe
before many days were over, even if I would postpone it for a single day
by going on for that space, secretly knowing what I know. All last night
I thought of what I would do; what remains is to do it.’

It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,
however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general.

In the meantime Mrs Chick sat swelling and bridling, and tossing her
head, as if she were still repeating that solemn formula of farewell to
Lucretia Tox. At length, she said aloud, “Oh the extent to which her
eyes had been opened that day!”

“What is her name?”

They still walked on towards the public-house, meditating with rueful
countenances, when Grimaldi spying something lying at the foot of a
tree, picked it up, and suddenly exclaimed, with a variety of winks and
nods, "Here's a sixpence."

The Major very hoarsely indicates his approval. Mr Carker, bending his
head forward over the table in the direction of Cousin Feenix, smiles
and nods a great many times.

VERSE: A WOMAN'S QUESTION

"Fred!" said Scrooge.

"'You'll be all right then, sir,' says Cobbs, 'with your beautiful
sweetheart by your side.'

As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the
direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked
round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for,
passed on.

“And oh, miss,” says Charley, clapping her hands, with the tears
starting down her dimpled cheeks, “Tom’s at school, if you please,
and learning so good! And little Emma, she’s with Mrs. Blinder, miss,
a-being took such care of! And Tom, he would have been at school—and
Emma, she would have been left with Mrs. Blinder—and me, I should
have been here—all a deal sooner, miss; only Mr. Jarndyce thought
that Tom and Emma and me had better get a little used to parting
first, we was so small. Don’t cry, if you please, miss!”

The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse of his
    mysterious visitor with the least danger of being seen himself, was
    by creeping on to the bed, and peeping out from between the curtains
    on the opposite side.  Keeping the curtains carefully closed with his
    hand, so that nothing more of him could be seen than his face and
    nightcap, and putting on his spectacles, he mustered up courage, and
    looked out.

The Holly-Tree was getting rather dismal.  I made an overland expedition
beyond the screen, and penetrated as far as the fourth window.  Here I
was driven back by stress of weather.  Arrived at my winter-quarters once
more, I made up the fire, and took another Inn.

and had the melancholy satisfaction of giving sepulture to the body of a
beloved husband.

“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of
my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”

There was a lowering energy in her face as she stood looking at me
while I explained the impossibility of my engaging her (without
thinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so),
which seemed to bring visibly before me some woman from the streets
of Paris in the reign of terror.

“They do not,” replied Rose, colouring deeply.

‘“Oh, the grave, eh?” said the goblin; “who makes graves at a time when
all other men are merry, and takes a pleasure in it?”

‘No I don’t, sir,’ returned Venus, very positively.

Chapter XXI.

To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive
reply of, “I don’t know—where do you come from?”

"Veller," replied Sam.

“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to
my sister; “it’s five-and-twenty pound.”

"Yes, sir," replied Nathalie, resuming her self-command,--"your injured
wife, who has discovered your perfidy, and has been made acquainted
with your disguise, and who has come in person to unravel the mystery
of your conduct."

Sikes made no reply, but, pulling open the door of which the Jew had
turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.

‘May I be permitted? Thank you. A fine old-fashioned watch,’ he said,
taking it in his hand. ‘Heavy for use, but massive and genuine. I have
a partiality for everything genuine. Such as I am, I am genuine myself.
Hah! A gentleman’s watch with two cases in the old fashion. May I remove
it from the outer case? Thank you. Aye? An old silk watch-lining, worked
with beads! I have often seen these among old Dutch people and Belgians.
Quaint things!’

“Not Richard?” I asked.

‘Well, sir,’ resumed Martin, stirring the fire once more, and drawing
his chair still closer to it, ‘his selfishness makes him exacting,
you see; and his obstinacy makes him resolute in his exactions. The
consequence is that he has always exacted a great deal from me in the
way of respect, and submission, and self-denial when his wishes were in
question, and so forth. I have borne a great deal from him, because I
have been under obligations to him (if one can ever be said to be under
obligations to one’s own grandfather), and because I have been really
attached to him; but we have had a great many quarrels for all that, for
I could not accommodate myself to his ways very often--not out of the
least reference to myself, you understand, but because--’ he stammered
here, and was rather at a loss.

Seventh Day.

Ah! my Twemlow! Say, little feeble grey personage, what thoughts are in
thy breast to-day, of the Fancy—so still to call her who bruised thy
heart when it was green and thy head brown—and whether it be better or
worse, more painful or less, to believe in the Fancy to this hour, than
to know her for a greedy armour-plated crocodile, with no more capacity
of imagining the delicate and sensitive and tender spot behind thy
waistcoat, than of going straight at it with a knitting-needle. Say
likewise, my Twemlow, whether it be the happier lot to be a poor
relation of the great, or to stand in the wintry slush giving the hack
horses to drink out of the shallow tub at the coach-stand, into which
thou has so nearly set thy uncertain foot. Twemlow says nothing, and
goes on.

When he had been with her for some time and it was found that he did not
gain in strength, a little carriage was hired for him, in which he could
lie at his ease with his books and be wheeled down to the seaside.

Mr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial. I never saw him such good
company. He made his face shine with the punch, so that it looked as if
it had been varnished all over. He got cheerfully sentimental about the
town, and proposed success to it; observing, that Mrs. Micawber and
himself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there, and that he
never should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in Canterbury.
He proposed me afterwards; and he, and Mrs. Micawber, and I, took a
review of our past acquaintance, in the course of which we sold the
property all over again. Then I proposed Mrs. Micawber; or, at least,
said, modestly, "If you'll allow me, Mrs. Micawber, I shall now have the
pleasure of drinking _your_ health, ma'am." On which Mr. Micawber
delivered an eulogium on Mrs. Micawber's character, and said she had
ever been his guide, philosopher, and friend, and that he would
recommend me, when I came to a marrying time of life, to marry such
another woman, if such another woman could be found.

"What! no stranger arrived!--no long-lost relative recovered!"
exclaimed Grimaldi, all his former apprehensions returning.

‘The man had moved into a sitting posture. His body was much bent, and
his face was wrinkled and yellow. His dress denoted him an inmate of the
workhouse: he had the appearance of being very old, but it looked more
the effect of dissipation or disease, than the length of years. He was
staring hard at the stranger, and though his eyes were lustreless and
heavy at first, they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed
expression after they had been fixed upon him for a short time, until
they seemed to be starting from their sockets. Edmunds gradually raised
himself to his knees, and looked more and more earnestly on the old
man’s face. They gazed upon each other in silence.

LADIES, before I couple you with the gentlemen, which will be at least
proper to the inscription over my head (St. Valentine’s day)—before I do
so, allow me, on behalf of my grateful sex here represented, to thank you
for the great pleasure and interest with which your gracious presence at
these festivals never fails to inspire us.  There is no English custom
which is so manifestly a relic of savage life as that custom which
usually excludes you from participation in similar gatherings.  And
although the crime carries its own heavy punishment along with it, in
respect that it divests a public dinner of its most beautiful ornament
and of its most fascinating charm, still the offence is none the less to
be severely reprehended on every possible occasion, as outraging equally
nature and art.  I believe that as little is known of the saint whose
name is written here as can well be known of any saint or sinner.  We,
your loyal servants, are deeply thankful to him for having somehow gained
possession of one day in the year—for having, as no doubt he has,
arranged the almanac for 1866—expressly to delight us with the enchanting
fiction that we have some tender proprietorship in you which we should
scarcely dare to claim on a less auspicious occasion.  Ladies, the utmost
devotion sanctioned by the saint we beg to lay at your feet, and any
little innocent privileges to which we may be entitled by the same
authority we beg respectfully but firmly to claim at your hands.

‘I am afraid, sir, do you know,’ argued Mr Rugg persuasively, ‘that you
are still allowing your feeling to be worked upon. I _don’t_ like the
term “reparation,” sir, except as a lever in the hands of counsel. Will
you excuse my saying that I feel it my duty to offer you the caution,
that you really must not allow your feelings to be worked upon?’

"She is right on one point at all events," said the old gentleman,
cheerfully. "Ring for the wine!"

‘“Don’t shake and tremble, then.”

Mais l'audace est commune, et le bon sens est rare;
    Au lieu d'être piquant, souvent on est bizarre:

"You are wrong.  The great drag-chain on the car of progress is the
faltering inconsistency of man.  Weakness is more cruel than
sternness.  Sentiment is more destructive than logic."

"Do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people, than to
keep one?"

‘Well, well, then--Bill Sikes,’ said the Jew, with abject humility.
‘You seem out of humour, Bill.’

"What place is this?" asked Scrooge.

There is a popular prejudice, a kind of superstition to the effect that
authors are not a particularly united body, that they are not invariably
and inseparably attached to each other.  I am afraid I must concede
half-a-grain or so of truth I to that superstition; but this I know, that
there can hardly be—that there hardly can have been—among the followers
of literature, a man of more high standing farther above these little
grudging jealousies, which do sometimes disparage its brightness, than
Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton.

"Very well; then here are the keys of the house,--this is the
address.  Go now,--select for me any bedroom you please; and since
the house has not been inhabited for weeks, make up a good fire,
air the bed well,--see, of course, that there are candles as well
as fuel.  Take with you my revolver and my dagger,--so much for my
weapons; arm yourself equally well; and if we are not a match for a
dozen ghosts, we shall be but a sorry couple of Englishmen.

Soon--ah, Love had not deceived me,
(Love's true instincts never err,)
Wounded, weak, escaped from prison,
He returned to me; to her.
I could thank God that bright morning,
When I felt my Brother's gaze,
That my heart was true and loyal,
As in our old boyish days.

Poor little Dora received this suggestion with something that was half a
sob and half a scream.

“Can you count it off, do you think, on more than that?” says she,
holding up her four skinny fingers and her long crooked thumb, all of a
tremble, right before his face.

He shut his face out for a moment, with the hand that again wandered over
his forehead, and then it lowered on Redlaw, reckless, ruffianly, and
callous.

‘Ah, Mr Pinch!’ said Miss Pecksniff. ‘It all comes of this unfortunate
marriage. If my sister had not been so precipitate, and had not united
herself to a Wretch, there would have been no Mr Chuffey in the house.’

"'Gan vail his stomach, and did grace the shame
    Of those that turned their backs; and, in his flight,
    Stumbling in fear, was took."

‘Demmit!’ cried Mr. Mantalini, turning his head towards his wife. ‘Will
it not slap and pinch the envious dowager, that dares to reflect upon
its own delicious?’

CHAPTER 55

‘Ah! dear Tom!’ said Ruth. ‘I suppose I ought to tell you everything
now. I should have no secrets from you. Should I, John, love?’

Chapter 24

“Ay, who was it? who was it?” asked the really warm-hearted
manufacturer; “let me know? I owe him my life.”

OFFICE OF "ALL THE YEAR ROUND," NO. 26, WELLINGTON STREET,
                               STRAND, LONDON, W.C.,
                                          _Tuesday, March 10th, 1863._

Her glowing cheek and moistened eye passed unnoticed by the sexton, who
turned towards old David, and called him by his name.  It was plain
that Becky Morgan’s age still troubled him; though why, the child could
scarcely understand.

Money being, in his position, the next best thing to men, King John
spared no means of getting it. He set on foot another oppressing and
torturing of the unhappy Jews (which was quite in his way), and
invented a new punishment for one wealthy Jew of Bristol. Until such
time as that Jew should produce a certain large sum of money, the King
sentenced him to be imprisoned, and, every day, to have one tooth
violently wrenched out of his head—beginning with the double teeth. For
seven days, the oppressed man bore the daily pain and lost the daily
tooth; but, on the eighth, he paid the money. With the treasure raised
in such ways, the King made an expedition into Ireland, where some
English nobles had revolted. It was one of the very few places from
which he did not run away; because no resistance was shown. He made
another expedition into Wales—whence he _did_ run away in the end: but
not before he had got from the Welsh people, as hostages, twenty-seven
young men of the best families; every one of whom he caused to be slain
in the following year.

Chapter 13

As it appeared that this was the best arrangement that could be made, it
was finally agreed upon. Mr. Weller, by his master’s permission, retired
to spend the evening in his own way; and was shortly afterwards elected,
by the unanimous voice of the assembled company, into the taproom chair,
in which honourable post he acquitted himself so much to the
satisfaction of the gentlemen-frequenters, that their roars of laughter
and approbation penetrated to Mr. Pickwick’s bedroom, and shortened the
term of his natural rest by at least three hours.

‘_Me_ unnatural!’ cried poor old Mrs. Pegler.  ‘_Me_ inhuman!  To my dear
boy?’

"Yes, yes, we know," said Mr. Pickwick, impatiently.

Austin, Mrs. Henry, ii. 447;
    letters to, ii. 154, 180, 384

“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”

Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,
I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her
occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural
place for me, that day.

“Now, mind how you put it, Bucket,” cried the old man anxiously with
his hand at his ear. “Speak up; none of your brimstone tricks. Pick
me up; I want to hear better. Oh, Lord, I am shaken to bits!”

‘Weak?’ said Mr. Dick.

"You know all about it, then?"

The timid little beauty promises in all earnestness to be
trustworthy.

Indeed he had the full benefit of it, and it so mauled him, though he
bent his head low and tried to present nothing but the mangy cap to it,
that he dropped under the lee of a tier of shipping, and they lay there
until it was over. The squall had come up, like a spiteful messenger
before the morning; there followed in its wake a ragged tear of light
which ripped the dark clouds until they showed a great grey hole of day.

We really did wonders last night in the way of arrangement. I see the
ground-plan of the first three acts distinctly. The dressing and
furnishing and so forth, will be a perfect picture, and I will answer
for the men in three weeks' time.

“But, suppose,” said my guardian, laughing, “he had meant the meat in
the bill, instead of providing it?”

“That’s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”

"Ring the alarm bell, somebody!" cried a dozen voices.

"What distance are we from Toulon?" inquired Lord Eustace, as he
carefully and anxiously scanned the stranger through his glass.

Night, like a giant, fills the church, from pavement to roof, and holds
dominion through the silent hours. Pale dawn again comes peeping
through the windows: and, giving place to day, sees night withdraw into
the vaults, and follows it, and drives it out, and hides among the
dead. The timid mice again cower close together, when the great door
clashes, and Mr Sownds and Mrs Miff treading the circle of their daily
lives, unbroken as a marriage ring, come in. Again, the cocked hat and
the mortified bonnet stand in the background at the marriage hour; and
again this man taketh this woman, and this woman taketh this man, on
the solemn terms:

"You understand me," continued Cently; "let me see; how many thousands?
I think it cannot be under fourscore,--great amount that!"

‘Why I am ready.  You have all been slow but me,’ said the old man.  ‘I
wonder who is more anxious to begin than I.’

‘With all my heart,’ said Mr Swiveller. ‘In the polite circles I
believe this sort of thing isn’t usually said to a gentleman in his own
apartments, but never mind that. Make yourself at home,’ adding to this
retort an observation to the effect that his friend appeared to be
rather ‘cranky’ in point of temper, Richard Swiveller finished the
rosy and applied himself to the composition of another glassful, in
which, after tasting it with great relish, he proposed a toast to an
imaginary company.

“You are pleased to say so, sir. But I do assure you that it is a
satisfaction to me to receive you in my humble home. And that is what I
would not say to everybody.” Ineffable loftiness on Mr. Sapsea’s part
accompanies these words, as leaving the sentence to be understood: “You
will not easily believe that your society can be a satisfaction to a
man like myself; nevertheless, it is.”

The stranger, meanwhile, had been eating, drinking, and talking, without
cessation. At every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and
approval of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner,
which could not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party
concerned; while at every bad attempt at a catch, and every failure to
stop the ball, he launched his personal displeasure at the head of the
devoted individual in such denunciations as--‘Ah, ah!--stupid’--‘Now,
butter-fingers’--‘Muff’--‘Humbug’--and so forth--ejaculations which
seemed to establish him in the opinion of all around, as a most
excellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble
game of cricket.

Everything with the formal couple resolves itself into a matter of form.
They don’t call upon you on your account, but their own; not to see how
you are, but to show how they are: it is not a ceremony to do honour to
you, but to themselves,—not due to your position, but to theirs.  If one
of a friend’s children die, the formal couple are as sure and punctual in
sending to the house as the undertaker; if a friend’s family be
increased, the monthly nurse is not more attentive than they.  The formal
couple, in fact, joyfully seize all occasions of testifying their
good-breeding and precise observance of the little usages of society; and
for you, who are the means to this end, they care as much as a man does
for the tailor who has enabled him to cut a figure, or a woman for the
milliner who has assisted her to a conquest.

The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation
overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the
house.

‘Barkis, ma’am,’ said Peggotty, with a curtsey.

“A line for a day would be quite as much as my uneventful life would
need, Heaven knows,” said Jasper, taking a book from a desk, “but that
my Diary is, in fact, a Diary of Ned’s life too. You will laugh at this
entry; you will guess when it was made:

‘Well,’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer, ‘we shall see.’

DEAR HULLAH,

‘John Elwes is the next, sir. Is it your pleasure to take John Elwes?’

"No, no, no!" cried Meg, delighted. "Nothing like Polonies!"

CHAPTER XXII. MR. PICKWICK JOURNEYS TO IPSWICH AND MEETS WITH A ROMANTIC
ADVENTURE WITH A MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS

“The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma’am,”
replied Mr. Bumble; “and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they
come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have
only themselves to thank.”

“What is the matter?” he said, holding the boy.

‘Or trace the progress of crime to ’bacca?’ growled another.

‘Meaning sir,’ observed Wegg, with a propitiatory face to draw him out,
and with another peg at his friend and brother, ‘in the way of money?’

“Of it? What?”

‘Sir,’ whispered John, with dignity, ‘I know my duty. We want no
love-making here, sir, unbeknown to parents. I respect a certain young
gentleman, taking him in the light of a young gentleman; I respect a
certain young lady, taking her in the light of a young lady; but of the
two as a couple, I have no knowledge, sir, none whatever. My son, sir,
is upon his patrole.’

It was Miss Edwards, and everybody said it was Miss Edwards, and Miss
Edwards herself admitted that it was.

My little wife came and sat upon my knee, to coax me to be quiet, and
drew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose; but I couldn't
dine off that, though it was very agreeable.

XIV.

The boy shook his head, and closing the book with a sigh, looked
vacantly round, and laid his head upon his arm. He was weeping.

“You excite my curiosity,” said I; “nothing I should like better than
to sleep in a haunted house. Pray give me the address of the one which
you left so ignominiously.”

CHAPTER IX
HEARING THE LAST OF IT

“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired,
“since he undertook that trust?”

‘Without admiring him for that,’ Clennam quietly observed, ‘I am very
sorry for him.’ The remark appeared to suggest to Plornish, for the
first time, that it might not be a very fine trait of character after
all. He pondered about it for a moment, and gave it up.

Still nobody came. The distant noises in the house had ceased, and
out of doors all was quiet; save for the occasional barking of some
deep-mouthed dog, and the shaking of the branches by the night wind.
He gazed mournfully out of window at each well-known object as it lay
sleeping in the dim light of the moon; and creeping back to his former
seat, thought about the late uproar, until, with long thinking of, it
seemed to have occurred a month ago. Thus, between dozing, and thinking,
and walking to the window and looking out, the night wore away; the grim
old screen, and the kindred chairs and tables, began slowly to reveal
themselves in their accustomed forms; the grey-eyed general seemed to
wink and yawn and rouse himself; and at last he was broad awake again,
and very uncomfortable and cold and haggard he looked, in the dull grey
light of morning.

_Enter FRANK, 2 E. L. H._

Mr. Datchery became so ecstatic over Mr. Sapsea’s composition, that, in
spite of his intention to end his days in Cloisterham, and therefore
his probably having in reserve many opportunities of copying it, he
would have transcribed it into his pocket-book on the spot, but for the
slouching towards them of its material producer and perpetuator,
Durdles, whom Mr. Sapsea hailed, not sorry to show him a bright example
of behaviour to superiors.

But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of
resort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe made
for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,
and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again
when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, as
it struck me.

I felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning, as I
had never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone since the day when I committed my
memorable offence. However, as it must be done, I went down, after two
or three false starts half-way, and as many runs back on tiptoe to my
own room, and presented myself in the parlor.

"How say'st thou,--that Macduff denies his person
    At our great bidding?"

‘I am not so blind, Sam, as not to have seen, a long time since, that
you entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards Mrs.
Winkle’s maid,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

Still, the Britons _would not_ yield. They rose again and again, and
died by thousands, sword in hand. They rose, on every possible
occasion. Suetonius, another Roman general, came, and stormed the
Island of Anglesey (then called Mona), which was supposed to be sacred,
and he burnt the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their own fires.
But, even while he was in Britain, with his victorious troops, the
Britons rose. Because Boadicea, a British queen, the widow of the King
of the Norfolk and Suffolk people, resisted the plundering of her
property by the Romans who were settled in England, she was scourged,
by order of Catus a Roman officer; and her two daughters were
shamefully insulted in her presence, and her husband’s relations were
made slaves. To avenge this injury, the Britons rose, with all their
might and rage. They drove Catus into Gaul; they laid the Roman
possessions waste; they forced the Romans out of London, then a poor
little town, but a trading place; they hanged, burnt, crucified, and
slew by the sword, seventy thousand Romans in a few days. Suetonius
strengthened his army, and advanced to give them battle. They
strengthened their army, and desperately attacked his, on the field
where it was strongly posted. Before the first charge of the Britons
was made, Boadicea, in a war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming in
the wind, and her injured daughters lying at her feet, drove among the
troops, and cried to them for vengeance on their oppressors, the
licentious Romans. The Britons fought to the last; but they were
vanquished with great slaughter, and the unhappy queen took poison.

‘“You seem in a hurry,” said the baron.

"I might," said Mr. Pickwick, "have taken a much greater revenge for
the treatment I have experienced at your hands, and that of your
hypocritical friend there."

“Ages have passed since we were in the habit of meeting, Mr.
Jarndyce.”

“This,” said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence
notwithstanding, “this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a
spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d’ ye-call-him’s
grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this
morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that
ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his
life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.”

Carton’s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look, but Carton’s hand was close and firm at his
nostrils, and Carton’s left arm caught him round the waist. For a few
seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on
the ground.

So, Rosa owned herself beaten. Langthwaite morality had been too
strong for her, and Langthwaite coldness too severe. Mr. Bentley had
won the battle, and she cared now only for her retreat. She packed up
her pictures and her books, her statues and her blue silk curtains;
advertised Whitefield House for sale; and sold it well too. A retired
sugar-broker bought it, and furnished it in gold and velvet. He had
not a picture, nor a bust, nor a book; but he had hangings that cost
a small fortune, and an assortment of colours that must surely please
some one, as none in the whole rainbow were absent. Rosa had nothing
to do with this; all she cared for, was to get out of Langthwaite, and
to leave Cumberland clouds for Italian sunshine. She went to make her
farewell calls. And, after having kissed all the Miss Grandvilles on
both cheeks--for she was a generous, forgiving woman, with a loving
heart and a perfect temper, and would not bear malice if she died for
it--and after having shaken hands cordially with Mr. Bentley--who, like
a foolish fat schoolboy, attempted to sulk--she turned her sweet face
to the south, and left a climate that was killing her, and a people who
did not love her, for the beauty and the graciousness of Italy.

‘It must have been a dream, Oliver,’ said Harry Maylie.

‘To see you married, Sammy--to see you a dilluded wictim, and thinkin’
in your innocence that it’s all wery capital,’ replied Mr. Weller. ‘It’s
a dreadful trial to a father’s feelin’s, that ‘ere, Sammy--’

"Yes it is, ma'am," said Mrs. Crupp.

Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing
weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the
furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the
single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great
towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot
by the service of Four fierce hours.

“Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.

‘I rather grieve--I _do_ rather grieve to think,’ said the child,
bursting into tears, ‘that those who die about us, are so soon
forgotten.’

"Good boy, Charley--well done!"--he mumbled.  "Oliver too, ha! ha! ha!
Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take that boy away to
bed!"

The boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor: so pale
with anxiety and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he
looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but
in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and
gentle spirit has but an instant fled to heaven, and the gross air
of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it
hallowed.

"Bless the child!" cried my esteemed friend, "what's amiss with his
brain?"

"Poor Travellers, The," i. 378;

Why does Traddles look so important when he calls upon me this afternoon
in the Commons--where I still occasionally attend, for form’s sake, when
I have time? The realization of my boyish day-dreams is at hand. I am
going to take out the licence.

‘Hard-hearted, ma’am?’ said Mr. Bumble. ‘Hard?’ Mr. Bumble resigned
his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney’s little finger
as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced
waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little
morsel farther from the fire.

“But was she here when the lady came? And what did the lady say to
her? And where is the lady gone? I beg and pray you to be so kind as
to tell me,” said I, “for I am in great distress to know.”

He dressed himself "all in his best," and at last got out into the
streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen
them with the Ghost of Christmas Present, and walking with his hands
behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He
looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four
good-humored fellows said, "Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to
you!" And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds
he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.

‘And I think,’ said the artist traveller, ‘I have seen one of them
before.’

My recent mention of the Carnival, reminds me of its being said to be a
mock mourning (in the ceremony with which it closes), for the gaieties
and merry-makings before Lent; and this again reminds me of the real
funerals and mourning processions of Rome, which, like those in most
other parts of Italy, are rendered chiefly remarkable to a Foreigner, by
the indifference with which the mere clay is universally regarded, after
life has left it.  And this is not from the survivors having had time to
dissociate the memory of the dead from their well-remembered appearance
and form on earth; for the interment follows too speedily after death,
for that: almost always taking place within four-and-twenty hours, and,
sometimes, within twelve.

They brought a hand-bier, and laid him on it, and covered him with a
flag, and took him up and bore him on towards the houses. All the men
who carried him had known him, and gone sailing with him, and seen him
merry and bold. They carried him through the wild roar, a hush in the
midst of all the tumult; and took him to the cottage where Death was
already.

‘That was well done!’ panted Bella, slackening in the next street, and
subsiding into a walk. ‘If I had left myself any breath to cry with, I
should have cried again. Now poor dear darling little Pa, you are going
to see your lovely woman unexpectedly.’

‘“And live after it!” says Tom.  “I’d sooner marry a mermaid with a
small-tooth comb and looking-glass.”

‘We have often seen each other,’ said Little Dorrit, recognising the
sexton, or the beadle, or the verger, or whatever he was, ‘when I have
been at church here.’

“In a little community like ours, my dear,” said the Jew, who felt it
necessary to qualify this position, “we have a general number one; that
is, you can’t consider yourself as number one without considering me
too as the same, and all the other young people.”

Old John, immensely flattered by the personal notoriety implied in this
familiar form of address, answered, with something like a knowing look,
‘I should believe you could, sir,’ and was turning over in his mind
various forms of eulogium, with the view of selecting one appropriate to
the qualities of his best bed, when his ideas were put to flight by Mr
Chester giving Barnaby the letter, and bidding him make all speed away.

‘Thought it was what boy?’ inquired the senior officer.

"At all events, Tom kicked the very tall man out at the front door half
an hour after, and married the widow a month after. And he used to
drive about the country, with the clay-coloured gig with red wheels,
and the vixenish mare with the fast pace, till he gave up business many
years afterwards, and went to France with his wife; and then the old
house was pulled down."

"Done to your done, and double done!" says he.  "Have you got a bit of
supper in the house?"

"I am a mortal," Scrooge remonstrated, "and liable to fall."

‘I don’t know what it is to be dead.  I supposed it meant that, when the
cup rattled against their teeth, and the water spilt over them.  I am
hungry and thirsty.’  That was all I had to say about it.

“I shouldn’t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,” said the third,
who had called the dogs back, “Mr. Giles ought to know.”

‘I know it,’ replied Tim, surveying him through his spectacles.

CHAPTER V-ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE

Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat
and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he
slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon
the little teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.

‘You have a physician,’ said Mrs Merdle.

CHAPTER VI.
           -"Mr" changed to "Mr."

‘You have no cause to be violent, sir,’ said Tom. ‘Though what I wish to
say relates to your own affairs, I know nothing of them, and desire to
know nothing of them.’

‘What a number of officers you seem to paint!’ said Kate, availing
herself of a pause in the discourse, and glancing round the room.

‘Your committee have pursued their grateful labours during the past
month, and have the unspeakable pleasure of reporting the following
additional cases of converts to Temperance.

"What is the matter?" asked the Spirit.

The little man shook his head and scratched it sadly, as he contemplated
this condition of a principal performer in his show. Seeing that they
were at a loss, the child said, timidly:

‘For the man of wrath, too!’ added Mr. Stiggins; ‘it makes a vessel’s
heart bleed!’

‘Yes, I thought you knew him, if he was anybody,’ triumphantly
exclaimed Mr. Malderton. ‘Who d’ye think he is?’

The dismal man readily complied; a circle was again formed round the
table, and harmony once more prevailed. Some lingering irritability
appeared to find a resting-place in Mr. Winkle’s bosom, occasioned
possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat--though it is scarcely
reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have excited
even a passing feeling of anger in a Pickwickian’s breast. With this
exception, their good-humour was completely restored; and the evening
concluded with the conviviality with which it had begun.

We are all sorry that you are not coming until the middle of next month,
but we hope that you will then be able to remain, so that we may all
come back together about the 10th of October. I think (recreation
allowed, etc.), that the play will take that time to write. The ladies
of the _dram. pers._ are frightfully anxious to get it under way, and to
see you locked up in the pavilion; apropos of which noble edifice I have
omitted to mention that it is made a more secluded retreat than it used
to be, and is greatly improved by the position of the door being
changed. It is as snug and as pleasant as possible; and the Genius of
Order has made a few little improvements about the house (at the rate of
about tenpence apiece), which the Genius of Disorder will, it is hoped,
appreciate.

Slowly, with held breath, and eyes aching in their stretched
fixity, I turn.  There it is!  Clear in the moonlight I see the
monstrous form within the bed,--the dark coverlet rises and falls
with its heaving breath. . . .  Ah! heaven have mercy!  Is there
none to help, none to save me from this awful presence? . . .

Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of
triumph.

She did not raise her eyes to him; but with a slight peremptory motion
of them, seemed to bid her mother come near. Mrs Skewton thought it
expedient to understand the hint, and advancing quickly, with her two
cavaliers, kept near her daughter from that time.

‘Well!’ said Sikes.

‘You shall have some of the very best, sir,’ replied the waiter.

This compromise, which was proposed with abundance of tears and sighs,
not exactly meeting the point at issue, nobody took any notice of it;
and poor Mrs. Nickleby accordingly proceeded to enlighten Mrs. Browdie
upon the advantages of such a scheme, and the unhappy results flowing,
on all occasions, from her not being attended to when she proffered her
advice.

"Oh! Mr. Pickwick, pray don't say so," cried Emily and Arabella, both
at once.

‘Ralph Nickleby,’ repeated Smike. ‘Ralph. I’ll get that name by heart.’

‘Morning, morning, morning!’

"The cloth _is_ now removed, signor," said I, "and you promised _then_
you would take off that everlasting garment."

‘All,’ replied the Jew.

"But who eats tripe?" said Mr. Filer, looking round. "Tripe is without
an exception the least economical, and the most wasteful article of
consumption that the markets of this country can by possibility produce.
The loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be, in the boiling,
seven-eighths of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other
animal substance whatever. Tripe is more expensive, properly understood,
than the hot-house pine-apple. Taking into account the number of animals
slaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone; and forming a
low estimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of these
animals, reasonably well butchered, would yield--I find that the waste
on that amount of tripe, if boiled, would victual a garrison of five
hundred men for five months of thirty-one days each, and a February
over. The Waste, the Waste!"

‘This is a weary day for me,’ said good Aunt Martha, smiling through her
tears, as she embraced her nieces; ‘for I lose my dear companion in
making you all happy; and what can you give me, in return for my Marion?’

But (who can read the secret book of Fate?)
    Just as the party pass'd the inn-yard gate,
    A startled pig--a young and timorous thing
    That in a puddle had been weltering--
    Woke from some rapturous dream, and in its fright
    Rush'd 'tween the nag's forelegs, who, woful sight!
    Employ'd his hinder ones so wondrous well,
    That Widow Higgins, bed, and daughters, fell
    (Alas, my muse!) into the porker's bath!
    Oh, day turn'd night! oh, pleasure sour'd to wrath!

"Truly nothing you mean, sir," said the Tinker, as he put away his tools.

‘Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain’t you?’ said Sowerberry;
giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.

“Meaning our three banking-house friends, L, S, and who’s the junior
partner? D?” said Mr. Skimpole, brightly. “Not an idea of them!”

“Yonder!” replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. “The shadow—I
saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the
wainscot like a breath!”

The adverse destinies ordained that one evening Mr Wegg’s labouring
bark became beset by polysyllables, and embarrassed among a perfect
archipelago of hard words. It being necessary to take soundings every
minute, and to feel the way with the greatest caution, Mr Wegg’s
attention was fully employed. Advantage was taken of this dilemma by
Mr Venus, to pass a scrap of paper into Mr Boffin’s hand, and lay his
finger on his own lip.

‘And what’s the news?’ said Richard.

‘Ma,’ Bella struck in, ‘Mr and Mrs Boffin are prosperous, no doubt; but
you have no right to say they are proud. You must know very well that
they are not.’

'_Yes_, _you are_.  _And why couldn't you say that at once_, _sir_?'

‘Where’s--confound the fellow, what’s his rascally name--Sikes;
that’s it. Where’s Sikes, you thief?’

"Have we been worse off," she went on, "since you forgot these cares and
we have been travelling on together?  Have we not been much better and
happier without a home to shelter us than ever we were in that unhappy
house, when thoughts of winning wealth were on your mind?"

“You’re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,” said Brittles.

‘So I am off,’ added Mr Merdle, getting up. ‘Could you lend me a
penknife?’

But where could she take refuge, and how could she go? She had never
breathed her dread of him to any one but Helena. If she went to Helena,
and told her what had passed, that very act might bring down the
irreparable mischief that he threatened he had the power, and that she
knew he had the will, to do. The more fearful he appeared to her
excited memory and imagination, the more alarming her responsibility
appeared; seeing that a slight mistake on her part, either in action or
delay, might let his malevolence loose on Helena’s brother.

"Plummy and slam!" was the reply.

This made Nell's grandfather very unhappy, and the girl, seeing his
misery, begged him to let her go and ask for the dwarf's help once more.
He gave her leave, and the child brought a note in reply, to the effect
that Quilp would visit the old man shortly.

‘Three weeks to-morrow,’ replied the servant.

"Dinner time, eh!" repeated Toby, using his right hand muffler like an
infantine boxing-glove, and punishing his chest for being cold.
"Ah-h-h-h!"

"Ah! But you can learn," she returned; "and you are a clever, clever
man!"

Notwithstanding my being, as I have mentioned, quite ready for a voyage,
still I had some doubts of this voyage.  Of course I knew, without being
told, that there were peculiar difficulties and dangers in it, a long way
over and above those which attend all voyages.  It must not be supposed
that I was afraid to face them; but, in my opinion a man has no manly
motive or sustainment in his own breast for facing dangers, unless he has
well considered what they are, and is able quietly to say to himself,
"None of these perils can now take me by surprise; I shall know what to
do for the best in any of them; all the rest lies in the higher and
greater hands to which I humbly commit myself."  On this principle I have
so attentively considered (regarding it as my duty) all the hazards I
have ever been able to think of, in the ordinary way of storm, shipwreck,
and fire at sea, that I hope I should be prepared to do, in any of those
cases, whatever could be done, to save the lives intrusted to my charge.

Let us try this public opinion by another test, which is important in
three points of view: first, as showing how desperately timid of the
public opinion slave-owners are, in their delicate descriptions of
fugitive slaves in widely circulated newspapers; secondly, as showing how
perfectly contented the slaves are, and how very seldom they run away;
thirdly, as exhibiting their entire freedom from scar, or blemish, or any
mark of cruel infliction, as their pictures are drawn, not by lying
abolitionists, but by their own truthful masters.

LISETTE. (_sharply_). And I.

The lethargic youth contrived without any additional rousing to set out
two card-tables; the one for Pope Joan, and the other for whist. The
whist-players were Mr. Pickwick and the old lady, Mr. Miller and the fat
gentleman. The round game comprised the rest of the company.

‘You know her very well?’

In time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was
a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their
cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's oven, where the
pavement smoked as if the stones were cooking, too.

It was the kind and wholesome face I have made mention of as being then
beside me, that I had purposed to myself to see, when I left home for
Wales.  I had heard of that clergyman, as having buried many scores of
the shipwrecked people; of his having opened his house and heart to their
agonised friends; of his having used a most sweet and patient diligence
for weeks and weeks, in the performance of the forlornest offices that
Man can render to his kind; of his having most tenderly and thoroughly
devoted himself to the dead, and to those who were sorrowing for the
dead.  I had said to myself, ‘In the Christmas season of the year, I
should like to see that man!’  And he had swung the gate of his little
garden in coming out to meet me, not half an hour ago.

‘That was judicious,’ remarked Perker; ‘and what else?’

‘I THINK I am,’ said Mrs. Wititterly, smiling.

“Well, that I do, sir,” replied the old lady. “People’s eyes, at my
time of life, don’t improve with age, sir.”

(33) Another proof that it was Mont St Jean and not Waterloo.

‘Certainly,’ added the doctor.

Faithfully yours.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE

Mrs Skewton returned no answer in words, but smiled upon the Major with
so much archness and vivacity, that that gallant officer considering
himself challenged, would have imprinted a kiss on her exceedingly red
lips, but for her interposing the fan with a very winning and juvenile
dexterity. It might have been in modesty; it might have been in
apprehension of some danger to their bloom.

I am extremely glad to hear that you have made a good start at the
Union. Take any amount of pains about it; open your mouth well and
roundly, speak to the last person visible, and give yourself time.

‘To whom?’ inquired Mr. Winkle.

The three boys sallied out: the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up
and his hat cocked as usual, Master Bates sauntering along with his
hands in his pockets, and Oliver between them, wondering where they
were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in
first.

“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; you
know so well how to deal with him.”

‘You are the American aloe of the human race, my dear Chiv,’ said Mr
Tigg, ‘which only blooms once in a hundred years!’

‘You looked as if you thought I was to blame,’ said Gride, timidly.

‘I know,’ replied the Blind Girl, in a gentle tone.  ‘I understand!’

I think you will find some good going in the next "Bleak House." I write
shortly, having been working my head off.

"Oh, never mind; never mind. Pray don't disturb yourself about such
a trifle," said Mr. Pickwick, observing the conflict of Bob Sawyer's
passions, as depicted in his countenance, "cold water will do very
well."

‘I have,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

"Ah!" exclaimed the old lady. "Well; it don't much matter. He don't
care for an old 'ooman like me, I dare say."

“Was it only yesterday,” he said, “when I observed the memory of this old
man to be a tissue of sorrow and trouble, and shall I be afraid,
to-night, to shake it? Are such remembrances as I can drive away, so
precious to this dying man that I need fear for _him_? No! I’ll stay
here.”

There was a passing cloud on Mr Meagles’s good-humoured face when they
all three (four, counting the dog, and he was the most objectionable
but one of the party) came in to breakfast. Neither it, nor the touch
of uneasiness on Mrs Meagles as she directed her eyes towards it, was
unobserved by Clennam.

"And I knew the story,--I knew it!" he cried.  "As boys we were not
allowed to hear much of our family traditions, but this one I knew.
When my father redid the interior of the east room, he removed at
the same time a board from above the doorway outside, on which had
been written--it is said by Dame Alice herself--a warning upon this
very subject.  I happened to be present when our old housekeeper,
who had been his nurse, remonstrated with him warmly upon this act;
and I asked her afterwards what the board was, and why she cared
about it so much.  In her excitement she told me the story of those
unhappy girls, repeating again and again that, if the warning were
taken away, evil would come of it."

“Hallo!” cried Sikes. “Nance. Where’s the gal going to at this time of
night?”

As we shall probably be busy all day to-morrow, I write this to-day,
though it will not leave New York until Wednesday. This is a very grim
place in a heavy thaw, and a most depressing one. The hotel also is
surprisingly bad, quite a triumph in that way. We stood out for an hour
in the melting snow, and came in again, having to change completely.
Then we sat down by the stove (no fireplace), and there we are now. We
were so afraid to go to bed last night, the rooms were so close and
sour, that we played whist, double dummy, till we couldn't bear each
other any longer. We had an old buffalo for supper, and an old pig for
breakfast, and we are going to have I don't know what for dinner at six.
In the public rooms downstairs, a number of men (speechless) are sitting
in rocking-chairs, with their feet against the window-frames, staring
out at window and spitting dolefully at intervals. Scott is in tears,
and George the gasman is suborning people to go and clean the hall,
which is a marvel of dirt. And yet we have taken considerably over three
hundred pounds for to-morrow night!

‘Who I wish had never been born!’ said the Secretary, with a gloomy
brow.

IT does not require any extraordinary sagacity in a commercial assembly
to appreciate the dire evils of war.  The great interests of trade
enfeebled by it, the enterprise of better times paralysed by it, all the
peaceful arts bent down before it, too palpably indicate its character
and results, so that far less practical intelligence than that by which I
am surrounded would be sufficient to appreciate the horrors of war.  But
there are seasons when the evils of peace, though not so acutely felt,
are immeasurably greater, and when a powerful nation, by admitting the
right of any autocrat to do wrong, sows by such complicity the seeds of
its own ruin, and overshadows itself in time to come with that fatal
influence which great and ambitious powers are sure to exercise over
their weaker neighbours.

‘This,’ said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence
notwithstanding, ‘this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by
a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d’ ye-call-him’s
grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this
morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that
ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his
life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.’

Grimaldi willingly complied, and having shortly afterwards to enact a
foppish scene, swaggered about the stage, ostentatiously displaying
this huge box, which from its enormous size really looked like a
caricature made expressly for the purpose, and offered a pinch to
the pantaloon with all that affectation of politeness in which he
was so ludicrous. The audience laughed at its gigantic size, and the
pantaloon, looking suspiciously at him, demanded,

"By Jove!" said Perker, taking both hands out of his pockets, and
striking the knuckles of his right against the palm of his left,
emphatically, "those are the cleverest scamps I ever had anything to do
with!"

‘Mr. Bumble!’ cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright
was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, ‘Mr. Bumble, I
shall scream!’ Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified
manner, put his arm round the matron’s waist.

‘Now it did unfortunately happen that old Lobbs being very hungry was
monstrous cross. Nathaniel Pipkin could hear him growling away like an
old mastiff with a sore throat; and whenever the unfortunate apprentice
with the thin legs came into the room, so surely did old Lobbs commence
swearing at him in a most Saracenic and ferocious manner, though
apparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by
the discharge of a few superfluous oaths. At length some supper, which
had been warming up, was placed on the table, and then old Lobbs fell
to, in regular style; and having made clear work of it in no time,
kissed his daughter, and demanded his pipe.

By the time the officer arrived, Sam had made himself so extremely
popular, that the congregated gentlemen determined to see him to prison
in a body. So off they set; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in
arm, the officer in front, and eight stout coachmen bringing up the
rear. At Serjeant’s Inn Coffee-house the whole party halted to refresh,
and, the legal arrangements being completed, the procession moved on
again.

‘Your daughter,’ said the other, when they had taken another silent turn
to and fro, and, after standing for a moment at the wall glancing down
at the sea, had resumed their walk, ‘is your only child, I know, Mr
Meagles. May I ask you--in no impertinent curiosity, but because I have
had so much pleasure in your society, may never in this labyrinth of
a world exchange a quiet word with you again, and wish to preserve an
accurate remembrance of you and yours--may I ask you, if I have not
gathered from your good wife that you have had other children?’

Mr Haredale entered, followed by the locksmith. Turning with a look of
great astonishment to the old woman who had opened the door, he inquired
for Mrs Rudge--for Barnaby. They were both gone, she replied, wagging
her ancient head, for good. There was a gentleman in the parlour, who
perhaps could tell them more. That was all SHE knew.

Apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin’s outer
garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a
chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen, wagging his
tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his
nature to be.

‘Then if you WOULD be good enough,’ said Traddles to Peggotty, ‘to
get the flower-pot now, I think I should like (it being Sophy’s,
Copperfield) to carry it home myself!’

‘Why, what a ridiculous woman you are, Martha,’ said the locksmith,
turning round with a smile.

However, the Duke of Norfolk, an honourable but rather weak nobleman,
partly because Mary was captivating, partly because he was ambitious,
partly because he was over-persuaded by artful plotters against
Elizabeth, conceived a strong idea that he would like to marry the
Queen of Scots—though he was a little frightened, too, by the letters
in the casket. This idea being secretly encouraged by some of the
noblemen of Elizabeth’s court, and even by the favourite Earl of
Leicester (because it was objected to by other favourites who were his
rivals), Mary expressed her approval of it, and the King of France and
the King of Spain are supposed to have done the same. It was not so
quietly planned, though, but that it came to Elizabeth’s ears, who
warned the Duke ‘to be careful what sort of pillow he was going to lay
his head upon.’ He made a humble reply at the time; but turned sulky
soon afterwards, and, being considered dangerous, was sent to the
Tower.

Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:

‘May I die,’ cried Montague, ‘but I am shocked! Upon my soul I am
shocked. But that confounded beehive of ours in the city must be
paramount to every other consideration, when there is honey to be made;
and that is my best excuse. Here is a very singular old female dropping
curtseys on my right,’ said Montague, breaking off in his discourse,
and looking at Mrs Gamp, ‘who is not a friend of mine. Does anybody know
her?’

‘You don’t think he is in a very, very bad way, do you?’ asked the
pleasant creature with her wholesome cordiality.

“What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!” said Duff, addressing Mr.
Giles, with supreme contempt.

Mr. Ralph Nickleby has some confidential Intercourse with another old
Friend. They concert between them a Project, which promises well for
both

I found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time, and the
curtains drawn before the windows and round the bed, giving it a very
snug appearance. I sat down in a great chair upon the hearth to meditate
on my happiness; and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for some time,
when I found a likeness of Miss Dartle looking eagerly at me from above
the chimney-piece.

‘I suppose you know the reason _now_, why my god-daughter here,’ kissing
the princess again, ‘did not apply to the fish-bone sooner?’ said the
fairy.

Peggotty said nothing for a little while; and I warmed my hands, as
silent as she.

‘My lord!’ thought Mrs. Nickleby. ‘Well, I never did--’

Governor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil,
expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody
but Mr. George.

Heart of London, there is a moral in thy every stroke! as I look on at
thy indomitable working, which neither death, nor press of life, nor
grief, nor gladness out of doors will influence one jot, I seem to hear a
voice within thee which sinks into my heart, bidding me, as I elbow my
way among the crowd, have some thought for the meanest wretch that
passes, and, being a man, to turn away with scorn and pride from none
that bear the human shape.

There was a fat little dancing-master who used to come in a gig, and
taught the more advanced among us hornpipes (as an accomplishment in
great social demand in after life); and there was a brisk little French
master who used to come in the sunniest weather, with a handleless
umbrella, and to whom the Chief was always polite, because (as we
believed), if the Chief offended him, he would instantly address the
Chief in French, and for ever confound him before the boys with his
inability to understand or reply.

‘In that case,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I shall have great pleasure in
coming.’

‘That makes no difference,’ said Martin. ‘I’ll take a dozen if you
like.’

"This, at least, is the light, my dear Mr. Copperfield," pursued Mrs.
Micawber, "in which _I_ view the subject. When I lived at home with my
papa and mama, my papa was accustomed to ask, when any point was under
discussion in our limited circle, 'In what light does my Emma view the
subject?' That my papa was too partial, I know; still, on such a point
as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between Mr. Micawber and
my family, I necessarily have formed an opinion, delusive though it may
be."

Oliver looked from one to the other with surprise, but he was not
permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily
across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman.  Oliver
walked a few paces after them, and, not knowing whether to advance or
retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.

“Be calm, madam.”

“Well!” said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most
impressive solemnity. “Well! of all the artful and designing orphans
that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.”

‘Are you mad?’ said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and
pointing towards the boys.

The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he
knew it.

OFFICE OF "HOUSEHOLD WORDS," _Wednesday Evening,
                                                 November 13th, 1850._

“I’ll warrant,” she observes, when he has been looking fixedly at her
for some consecutive moments, with a singular appearance in his eyes of
seeming to see her a long way off, instead of so near him: “I’ll
warrant you made the journey in a many ways, when you made it so
often?”

"That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages
which must accrue to the cause of science from the production to which
they have just adverted,--no less than from the unwearied researches
of Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., in Hornsey, Highgate, Brixton,
and Camberwell,--they cannot but entertain a lively sense of the
inestimable benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the
speculations of that learned man into a wider field, from extending his
travels, and consequently enlarging his sphere of observation, to the
advancement of knowledge, and the diffusion of learning.

The next morning all Chatham was in an uproar. The Clerk of St.
Bridget's had found himself at home at daybreak, seated in his own
arm-chair, the fire out, and--the tankard of ale quite exhausted.
Who had drunk it? Where had he been? How had he got home?--all was a
mystery: he remembered "a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;" all
was fog and fantasy. What he could clearly recollect was, that he had
dug up the grinning sailor, and that the Saint had helped to throw him
into the river again. All was thenceforth wonderment and devotion.
Masses were sung, tapers were kindled, bells were tolled; the monks
of St. Romuald had a solemn procession, the abbot at their head, the
sacristan at their tail, and the holy breeches of St. Thomas-à-Becket
in the centre; Father Fothergill brewed a XXX puncheon of holy-water.
The Rood of Gillingham was deserted; the chapel of Rainham forsaken;
every one who had a soul to be saved flocked with his offering to St.
Bridget's shrine, and Emanuel Saddleton gathered more fees from the
promiscuous piety of that one week than he had pocketed during the
twelve preceding months.

"Surely," replied Mr. Pickwick.

‘Professors Woodensconce and Grime, with a degree of good humour that
delights us all, have just arranged to toss for a bottle of mulled
port. There has been some discussion whether the payment should be
decided by the first toss or the best out of three. Eventually the
latter course has been determined on. Deeply do I wish that both
gentlemen could win; but that being impossible, I own that my personal
aspirations (I speak as an individual, and do not compromise either you
or your readers by this expression of feeling) are with Professor
Woodensconce. I have backed that gentleman to the amount of
eighteenpence.’

“What is its warning against?” he said, ruminating, with his eyes on the
fire, and only by times turning them on me.  “What is the danger?  Where
is the danger?  There is danger overhanging somewhere on the Line.  Some
dreadful calamity will happen.  It is not to be doubted this third time,
after what has gone before.  But surely this is a cruel haunting of me.
What can I do?”

"Well, Marchioness," said Mr. Swiveller, "that's not uncomplimentary.
Merriment, Marchioness, is not a bad or degrading quality. Old King Cole
was himself a merry old soul, if we may put any faith in the pages of
history."

‘Vell,’ said Sam, rising and setting down his glass, ‘all I can say is,
that I vish you _may _get it.’

Mr. Wisbottle started from the table, and every one looked up.

“So you think he might be hard upon me, eh?”

Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes
shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he
started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried
back to his chair. The cook and housemaid screamed.

‘You didn’t keep ‘em in suspense as long as you said you would, though,’
returned Tim, archly. ‘Why, Mr. Nickleby and Mr. Frank were to have
been in your room for I don’t know how long; and I don’t know what you
weren’t to have told them before you came out with the truth.’

When it had said these words the Specter took its wrapper from the
table and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the
smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the
bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his
supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its
chain wound over and about its arm.

She was hurrying to him, unobserved, when he got up out of his chair,
and leaning over the table called to her, supposing her to be still in
her place:

Thus he was constantly addressed, even in minor notes on business, as
‘Dear Rumty’; in answer to which, he sedately signed himself, ‘Yours
truly, R. Wilfer.’

The lady lay upon her bed as he had left her, clasping her little
daughter to her breast. The child clung close about her, with the same
intensity as before, and never raised her head, or moved her soft cheek
from her mother’s face, or looked on those who stood around, or spoke,
or moved, or shed a tear.

‘“But under whatever circumstances he may be placed,”’ said Hilda,
continuing the letter, ‘“whether he gives up the property or not, I call
upon you to fulfil your part of the contract, as I would have fulfilled
mine, whatever might have happened to you; and to make, as you have
agreed to do, a settlement upon your daughter proportioned to your
means.”’

I told him that I was going down to my aunt, the Dragon of that night,
early in the morning; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted
and excellent of women, as he would know full well if he knew her
better. The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again,
appeared to terrify him. He replied with a small pale smile, ‘Is she so,
indeed, sir? Really?’ and almost immediately called for a candle, and
went to bed, as if he were not quite safe anywhere else. He did not
actually stagger under the negus; but I should think his placid little
pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute, than it had
done since the great night of my aunt’s disappointment, when she struck
at him with her bonnet.

Mr Jonas was the Griffin. He sat down upon the grass at her side, in
spite of this warning, and sulkily inquired:

‘Yes, yes--what?’ cried the other.

Going up to him, we found him dead.  I have often, very often, seen him
sleeping, and always peacefully, but I never saw him look so calm and
tranquil.  His face wore a serene, benign expression, which had impressed
me very strongly when we last shook hands; not that he had ever had any
other look, God knows; but there was something in this so very spiritual,
so strangely and indefinably allied to youth, although his head was gray
and venerable, that it was new even in him.  It came upon me all at once
when on some slight pretence he called me back upon the previous night to
take me by the hand again, and once more say, ‘God bless you.’

Railways, ii. 242

‘I’m only sixty-one,’ said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face.
‘And, as the devil’s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at
least, I don’t see the application of that remark.’

‘Ye-es,’ faltered Little Dorrit, whom he greatly confused, ‘I suppose
so, while you do no harm.’

“Where is she?” said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered
facetious. “It would be hard to tell. There’s no midwifery there,
whichever place she’s gone to; so I suppose she’s out of employment any
way.”

“Oh!” said he. “You have heard of the name. But the question is, what
do you say of it?”

Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,
brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and
punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy
glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on
Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made
a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the
snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops
of their houses: whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come
plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial
little snowstorms.

The next six or eight years of my life were shifting and unsettled
enough.  A morose and restless man, I took employment here and there, as
opportunity offered, turning my hand to many things, and caring little
what I earned, so long as the work was hard and the change incessant.
First of all I engaged myself as chief engineer in one of the French
steamers plying between Marseilles and Constantinople.  At Constantinople
I changed to one of the Austrian Lloyd’s boats, and worked for some time
to and from Alexandria, Jaffa, and those parts.  After that, I fell in
with a party of Mr. Layard’s men at Cairo, and so went up the Nile and
took a turn at the excavations of the mound of Nimroud.  Then I became a
working engineer on the new desert line between Alexandria and Suez; and
by-and-by I worked my passage out to Bombay, and took service as an
engine fitter on one of the great Indian railways.  I stayed a long time
in India; that is to say, I stayed nearly two years, which was a long
time for me; and I might not even have left so soon, but for the war that
was declared just then with Russia.  That tempted me.  For I loved danger
and hardship as other men love safety and ease; and as for my life, I had
sooner have parted from it than kept it, any day.  So I came straight
back to England; betook myself to Portsmouth, where my testimonials at
once procured me the sort of berth I wanted.  I went out to the Crimea in
the engine-room of one of her Majesty’s war steamers.

This year, too, the proprietors of Drury Lane, in pursuance of a
custom to which they had adhered for some years, produced an expensive
pageant instead of a pantomime; an alteration, in Grimaldi's opinion,
very little for the better, if not positively for the worse. It having
been the established custom for many years to produce a pantomime at
Christmas, the public naturally looked for it; and although such pieces
as "Blue Beard," "Feudal Times," "Lodoiska," and others of the same
class, undoubtedly drew money to the house, still it is questionable
whether they were so profitable to the treasury as the pantomimes at
Covent Garden. If we may judge from the result, they certainly were
not, for after several years' trial, during the whole of which time
pantomimes were annually produced at Covent Garden, the Christmas
pantomime was again brought forward at Drury Lane, to the exclusion of
spectacle.

‘Oh, you naughty man--but really, if their complexions were a little
better, don’t you think they would be nice-looking girls--by
candlelight?’

“Oh, blow that!” said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk
handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,
“that’s too mean; that is.”

‘No, dear Sophronia. From my lower level, I regard Mr Boffin as too
generous, as possessed of too much clemency, as being too good to
persons who are unworthy of him and ungrateful to him. To those noble
qualities I can lay no claim. On the contrary, they rouse my indignation
when I see them in action.’

“I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evrémonde, but I have done nothing. I
am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
Citizen Evrémonde. Such a poor weak little creature!”

‘Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,’ said Mrs. Mann.

‘A very little one,’ replied the small servant.

‘This,’ said Squeers, ‘is a bundle of overdue acceptances and renewed
bills of six or eight young gentlemen, but they’re all MPs, so it’s of
no use to anybody. Throw it in the fire!’ Peg did as she was bidden, and
waited for the next.

"He is quite well, Copperfield, thank you," said Traddles. "I am not
living with him at present."

To see old Philip’s pity for him, to see him wheel his own great chair
for him to rest in, and look down upon him with a solemn sense of his
bereavement, was to know, in some degree, how precious to old age such
recollections are.

‘“Was it a large one?” inquired Tom Smart.

Introduction to Melmoth the Wanderer

“What is this?” inquired one of the magistrates.

Walter Tyrrel, the son of a Norman Papa,
    Has, somehow or other, a Saxon Mamma:
    Though humble, yet far above mere vulgar loons,
    He's a sort of a Sub in the Rufus dragoons;
    Has travell'd but comes home abruptly, the rather
    That some unknown rascal has murder'd his father;
    And scarce has he pick'd out, and stuck in his quiver,
    The arrow that pierc'd the old gentleman's liver,
    When he finds, as misfortunes come rarely alone,
    That his Sweetheart has bolted,--with whom is not known.
    But, as murder will out, he at last finds the lady
    At court, with her character grown rather shady;
    This gives him the "Blues," and impairs the delight
    He'd have otherwise felt when they dub him a Knight
    For giving a runaway stallion a check,
    And preventing his breaking King Rufus's neck.

‘I--hem!--I can’t think, Amy, what has given Chivery offence. He is
generally so--so very attentive and respectful. And to-night he was
quite--quite short with me. Other people there too! Why, good Heaven!
if I was to lose the support and recognition of Chivery and his brother
officers, I might starve to death here.’ While he spoke, he was opening
and shutting his hands like valves; so conscious all the time of that
touch of shame, that he shrunk before his own knowledge of his meaning.

"Go for a soldier, do you mean?" returned my aunt, alarmed; "or go to
sea? I won't hear of it. You are to be a proctor. We're not going to
have any knockings on the head in _this_ family, if you please, sir."

_"Who are you, you rascal?"_                                  296

Little Miss Peecher, from her little official dwelling-house, with its
little windows like the eyes in needles, and its little doors like the
covers of school-books, was very observant indeed of the object of her
quiet affections. Love, though said to be afflicted with blindness, is
a vigilant watchman, and Miss Peecher kept him on double duty over Mr
Bradley Headstone. It was not that she was naturally given to playing
the spy—it was not that she was at all secret, plotting, or mean—it
was simply that she loved the irresponsive Bradley with all the
primitive and homely stock of love that had never been examined or
certificated out of her. If her faithful slate had had the latent
qualities of sympathetic paper, and its pencil those of invisible ink,
many a little treatise calculated to astonish the pupils would have come
bursting through the dry sums in school-time under the warming influence
of Miss Peecher’s bosom. For, oftentimes when school was not, and her
calm leisure and calm little house were her own, Miss Peecher would
commit to the confidential slate an imaginary description of how, upon
a balmy evening at dusk, two figures might have been observed in the
market-garden ground round the corner, of whom one, being a manly form,
bent over the other, being a womanly form of short stature and some
compactness, and breathed in a low voice the words, ‘Emma Peecher, wilt
thou be my own?’ after which the womanly form’s head reposed upon the
manly form’s shoulder, and the nightingales tuned up. Though all unseen,
and unsuspected by the pupils, Bradley Headstone even pervaded the
school exercises. Was Geography in question? He would come triumphantly
flying out of Vesuvius and Aetna ahead of the lava, and would boil
unharmed in the hot springs of Iceland, and would float majestically
down the Ganges and the Nile. Did History chronicle a king of men?
Behold him in pepper-and-salt pantaloons, with his watch-guard round
his neck. Were copies to be written? In capital B’s and H’s most of the
girls under Miss Peecher’s tuition were half a year ahead of every other
letter in the alphabet. And Mental Arithmetic, administered by Miss
Peecher, often devoted itself to providing Bradley Headstone with a
wardrobe of fabulous extent: fourscore and four neck-ties at two and
ninepence-halfpenny, two gross of silver watches at four pounds fifteen
and sixpence, seventy-four black hats at eighteen shillings; and many
similar superfluities.

Ever, my dearest Kate,
                                                 Affectionately yours.

So Bullfinch approached the coffee-room door, and melodiously pitching
his voice into a bar where two young ladies were keeping the books of the
Temeraire, apologetically explained that we wished to order a little
dinner in an hour, and that we were debarred from the execution of our
inoffensive purpose by consignment to solitude.

MY DEAR LORD JOHN RUSSELL,

‘Or the Griggs!’ cried Miss Nupkins.

‘Professor Grime is in bed, to all appearance quite well; but he _will_
eat, and it is disagreeable to see him.  Has this gentleman no sympathy
with the sufferings of his fellow-creatures?  If he has, on what
principle can he call for mutton-chops—and smile?’

But all these occurrences preceded the final day. And now the day
arrived when he and his family were to leave the prison for ever, and
when the stones of its much-trodden pavement were to know them no more.

Although the signor's name was decidedly foreign, so English was
his appearance, and so entirely did he disguise his accent, that
it was impossible to tell of what place he was a native, if not of
London, and of the very heart of it; for he had caught completely the
peculiarities which distinguish the so-called cockney part of the City,
and obliterated his h's and doubled his v's, as if he had been for all
his life in the neighbourhood of Bow-bells. Signor Dandolo was a stout
gentleman of five feet nine, with amazing expanse of mouth, chest, and
whiskers, which latter were of a red hue.

“Does he teach?” asked Ada.

‘Yes, my dear, it is undoubtedly a gain.’

He sat down, with his head buried in his hands, and, when he rose up,
made the second strong resolution in his life,--that neither to the
French officer, nor to the mother of his departed friend, nor to any
soul, while either of the two was living, would he breathe what only he
knew. And when he touched that French officer's glass with his own, that
day at dinner, he secretly forgave him in the name of the Divine
Forgiver of Injuries.

NOTES.

“My dear Helena, no. Travel like a pilgrim, with wallet and staff. My
wallet—or my knapsack—is packed, and ready for strapping on; and here
is my staff!”

"Yes, Miss Havisham."

Tackleton had brought his leg of mutton, and, wonderful to relate, a
tart besides--but we don't mind a little dissipation when our brides are
in the case; we don't get married every day--and, in addition to these
dainties, there were the Veal and Ham Pie, and "things," as Mrs.
Peerybingle called them; which were chiefly nuts and oranges, and cakes,
and such small deer. When the repast was set forth on the board, flanked
by Caleb's contribution, which was a great wooden bowl of smoking
potatoes (he was prohibited, by solemn compact, from producing any other
viands), Tackleton led his intended mother-in-law to the post of honour.
For the better gracing of this place at the high festival, the majestic
old soul had adorned herself with a cap, calculated to inspire the
thoughtless with sentiments of awe. She also wore her gloves. But let us
be genteel, or die!

"Although for many weeks after this, he was watched, night and day,
in the wildest ravings of fever, neither the consciousness of his
loss, nor the recollection of the vow he had made, ever left him for
a moment. Scenes changed before his eyes, place succeeded place, and
event followed event, in all the hurry of delirium; but they were all
connected in some way with the great object of his mind. He was sailing
over a boundless expanse of sea, with a blood-red sky above, and the
angry waters, lashed into fury beneath, boiled and eddied up, on every
side. There was another vessel before them, toiling and labouring in
the howling storm: her canvas fluttering in ribbons from the mast, and
her deck thronged with figures who were lashed to the sides, over which
huge waves every instant burst, sweeping away some devoted creatures
into the foaming sea. Onward they bore, amidst the roaring mass of
water, with a speed and force which nothing could resist; and striking
the stern of the foremost vessel, crushed her beneath their keel. From
the huge whirlpool which the sinking wreck occasioned, arose a shriek
so loud and shrill--the death-cry of a hundred drowning creatures,
blended into one fierce yell--that it rung far above the war-cry of the
elements, and echoed and re-echoed till it seemed to pierce air, sky
and ocean. But what was that--that old grey-head that rose above the
water's surface, and with looks of agony, and screams for aid, buffeted
with the waves! One look, and he had sprung from the vessel's side, and
with vigorous strokes was swimming towards it. He reached it; he was
close upon it. They were _his_ features. The old man saw him coming,
and vainly strove to elude his grasp. But he clasped him tight, and
dragged him beneath the water. Down, down with him, fifty fathoms down;
his struggles grew fainter and fainter, until they wholly ceased. He
was dead; he had killed him, and had kept his oath.

“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a little
unreasonable, “you yourself see me put ’em in my ’at, and therefore you
know as they are here.” With which he took them out, and gave them, not
to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good
fellow,—I _know_ I was ashamed of him,—when I saw that Estella stood at
the back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughed
mischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to
Miss Havisham.

‘Ah! to be sure,’ replied the doctor, ‘so there is. That was your
handiwork, Giles, I understand.’

That this song of the kettle's was a song of invitation and welcome to
somebody out of doors: to somebody at that moment coming on towards the
snug small home and the crisp fire: there is no doubt whatever. Mrs.
Peerybingle knew it perfectly, as she sat musing before the hearth. It's
a dark night, sang the kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by the
way; and, above, all is mist and darkness, and, below, all is mire and
clay; and there's only one relief in all the sad and murky air; and I
don't know that it is one, for it's nothing but a glare; of deep and
angry crimson, where the sun and wind together; set a brand upon the
clouds for being guilty of such weather; and the widest open country is
a long dull streak of black; and there's hoar frost on the finger-post,
and thaw upon the track; and the ice it isn't water, and the water isn't
free; and you couldn't say that anything is what it ought to be; but
he's coming, coming, coming!--

"Yes, yes, rather than live as we do now," said the child.  "If you are
sad, let me know why, and be sad too; if you waste away, and are paler
and weaker every day, let me be your nurse and try to comfort you. If
you are poor, let us be poor together; but let me be with you, do let me
be with you.  Do not let me see such change and not know why, or I shall
break my heart and die.  Dear grandfather, let us leave this sad place
to-morrow, and beg our way from door to door."

The wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not more
sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of, had been diminished
by the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds. But, the sea,
having upon it the additional agitation of the whole night, was
infinitely more terrific than when I had seen it last. Every appearance
it had then presented, bore the expression of being _swelled_; and the
height to which the breakers rose, and, looking over one another, bore
one another down, and rolled in, in interminable hosts, was most
appalling.

“Perhaps I was not,” she answered, putting a hand to her head. “Begin
again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.”

Is fraught with some Danger to Miss Nickleby’s Peace of Mind

A female servant was waiting at a side gate in the garden-wall, and
admitted him without delay. He hurried along the terrace-walk, and
darted up a flight of broad steps leading into an old and gloomy hall,
whose walls were ornamented with rusty suits of armour, antlers, weapons
of the chase, and suchlike garniture. Here he paused, but not long; for
as he looked round, as if expecting the attendant to have followed, and
wondering she had not done so, a lovely girl appeared, whose dark hair
next moment rested on his breast. Almost at the same instant a heavy
hand was laid upon her arm, Edward felt himself thrust away, and Mr
Haredale stood between them.

Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon
his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.

‘Come down by the night-coach, this morning, sir.’

“Not a penny,” replied the girl, waving her hand.

If Jane, or Maria, for work should agree,
    The dear creatures invariably send down for me
    To make myself useful, and read while they knit,
    Paint, draw, or do anything they may think fit.
    Thus, Sam--poor pill-garlic!--they safely trepan:
    Alack! what a life leads a Useful Young Man!

Kate says, will you take counsel with Charlotte about colour (I put in
my word, as usual, for brightness), and have the darlings' bonnets made
at once, by the same artist as before? Kate would have written, but is
gone with Black to a day performance at the opera, to see Cerito dance.
At two o'clock each day we sally forth in an open carriage, with a large
sack of sugar-plums and at least five hundred little nosegays to pelt
people with. I should think we threw away, yesterday, a thousand of the
latter. We had the carriage filled with flowers three or four times. I
wish you could have seen me catch a swell brigand on the nose with a
handful of very large confetti every time we met him. It was the best
thing I have ever done. "The Chimes" are nothing to it.

So beautiful and wealthy and accomplished a maiden was naturally not
without suitors; and from this direction, too, at first, Queen Claribel
trusted fondly that cure might come.

(2) General Alava, who was Minister Plenipotentiary from Spain to the
King of the Netherlands.

‘Is this man in town?’ said the impatient single gentleman.  ‘Speak
faster.’

[Sidenote: Miss Power.]

‘Do you think he will come round?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.

Before the child could reply to this earnest solicitation, the
street-door opened, and Mr Brass thrusting out his night-capped head
called in a surly voice, ‘Who’s there!’  Kit immediately glided away,
and Nell, closing the window softly, drew back into the room.

The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr.
Bumble.

I wondered what she was thinking about, as I glanced in admiring silence
at the little soft hand travelling up the row of buttons on my coat, and
at the clustering hair that lay against my breast, and at the lashes of
her downcast eyes, slightly rising as they followed her idle fingers. At
length her eyes were lifted up to mine, and she stood on tiptoe to
give me, more thoughtfully than usual, that precious little kiss--once,
twice, three times--and went out of the room.

‘I should be able to,’ answered the old man, in a trembling voice,
‘for, come next summer, I have been sexton here, good fifty years.  The
right hand path, friend, is the road.--There is no ill news for our
good gentleman, I hope?’

‘I ain’t,’ said the spinster aunt, her indignation getting the better of
her determination to faint.

‘I tell you, sir,’ said Mr Dorrit, panting with anger, ‘that you
separate me--ha--from other gentlemen; that you make distinctions
between me and other gentlemen of fortune and station. I demand of you,
why? I wish to know on--ha--what authority, on whose authority. Reply
sir. Explain. Answer why.’

"Wery good, sir," replied Sam. "There's a couple o' Sawbones
downstairs."

"We're going to be married, Cobbs, at Gretna Green," returned the boy.
"We have run away on purpose. Norah has been in rather low spirits,
Cobbs; but she'll be happy, now we have found you to be our friend."

The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it,
looked after him as he walked up the dark passage, shook his clenched
fist, muttered a deep curse, and then with a horrible grin reseated
himself at the table, where he was soon deeply absorbed in the
interesting pages of the Hue and Cry.

Mount-Norris, Lord, 18.

            written.

“She is not well, and has changed very much of late.”

The next morning she met the showmen at breakfast.

First of all, here is enclosed a letter for Mrs. Stanfield, which, if
you don't immediately and faithfully deliver, you will hear of in an
unpleasant way from the station-house at the curve of the hill above
you.

_Manager._--But I don't think I shall do that sort of thing.

Ever, my dear Forster, affectionately.

Mr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room
and the next and looks in. The library is deserted, and the fire is
sinking low. Mr. Bucket’s eye, after taking a pigeon-flight round the
room, alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they
arrive. Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it. Mr. Bucket
draws near and examines the directions. “No,” he says, “there’s none
in that hand. It’s only me as is written to. I can break it to Sir
Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to-morrow.”

"You are not looking at it," said Scrooge.

[Sidenote: Mr. W. H. Wills.]

They were very fond of one another: that was certain. I take it that had
its effect upon me, as a touch of nature; but the skill with which the
one followed up whatever the other said, was a touch of art which I was
still less proof against. When there was nothing more to be got out of
me about myself (for on the Murdstone and Grinby life, and on my
journey, I was dumb), they began about Mr. Wickfield and Agnes. Uriah
threw the ball to Mrs. Heep, Mrs. Heep caught it and threw it back to
Uriah, Uriah kept it up a little while, then sent it back to Mrs. Heep,
and so they went on tossing it about until I had no idea who had got it,
and was quite bewildered. The ball itself was always changing too. Now
it was Mr. Wickfield, now Agnes, now the excellence of Mr. Wickfield,
now my admiration of Agnes; now the extent of Mr. Wickfield's business
and resources, now our domestic life after dinner; now, the wine that
Mr. Wickfield took, the reason why he took it, and the pity that it was
he took so much; now one thing, now another, then everything at once;
and all the time, without appearing to speak very often, or to do
anything but sometimes encourage them a little, for fear they should be
overcome by their humility and the honor of my company, I found myself
perpetually letting out something or other that I had no business to let
out, and seeing the effect of it in the twinkling of Uriah's dinted
nostrils.

Kate bowed her head, to intimate that she heard, and was satisfied.

Newman made no answer to this remark, but, halting abruptly, planted
Nicholas with his back to some area railings, and gave him to understand
that he was to wait there, without moving hand or foot, until it was
satisfactorily ascertained that the coast was clear. This done, Noggs
limped away with great alacrity; looking over his shoulder every
instant, to make quite certain that Nicholas was obeying his directions;
and, ascending the steps of a house some half-dozen doors off, was lost
to view.

Shall I be weak enough to confess it? The respect I bore the old
man even now; my affection for his daughter, my love for the child,
went some part of the way towards a reason for declining Taylor's
proposal; but it did not go all the way. I hated Steiner so intensely,
so mortally, and he supplied me daily with such additional cause of
hatred, that I felt a species of excitement, of delight, in renewing
from time to time my altercations with him: a delight which was
considerably increased by the fact that he was quite incapable of
competing with me in argument. There was another reason, which added
a zest, if anything could do so, to the exquisite pleasure I derived
from tormenting him,--the belief I entertained that Bromley and himself
dared not part with me: they knew my value too well. Bromley, at least,
I was well aware, was conscious enough of that.

He waved the light over the whole, as if to typify the light of his
scholarly intelligence, and then put it down on the table and stood
behind it looking intently at his visitors. He had the special
peculiarity of some birds of prey, that when he knitted his brow, his
ruffled crest stood highest.

‘Wery pleasant,’ rejoined Mr. Weller. ‘Wery pleasant and comformable.’

The entrance of the lady whom he announced, to take her place at the
breakfast-table, terminated the discussion. Shortly afterwards, the
courier announced that the valet, and the footman, and the two maids,
and the four guides, and the fourteen mules, were in readiness; so the
breakfast party went out to the convent door to join the cavalcade.

He spoke in a tone so very different from his usual confidence, and with
such an obvious dread of Mark’s reply, that the good-natured fellow was
full of pity.

‘A reply always on the tip of his tongue!’ cried old Arthur, raising his
hands and eyes in admiration. ‘He is always prepared! Oh dear, what a
blessing to have such a ready wit, and so much ready money to back it!’
Then, suddenly changing his tone, he went on: ‘I have been backwards and
forwards to Bray’s lodgings several times within the last six months.
It is just half a year since I first saw this delicate morsel, and, oh
dear, what a delicate morsel it is! But that is neither here nor there.
I am his detaining creditor for seventeen hundred pounds!’

‘I’ll take this man myself, sir,’ said Mr Inspector to Lightwood. Then
to Riderhood, ‘Is he at home? Where is he? What’s he doing? You have
made it your business to know all about him, no doubt.’

“To have the goodness to walk off, if you please,” rejoined the
Manager, stretching forth his arm, “and to carry your jargon somewhere
else.”

"Doubtless I should," said I with a cool smile that enraged him. "Mr.
---- would follow _me_ certainly, and many others would follow _him_,
Mr. Steiner."

‘I thought I’d wait for you here. I wouldn’t go on to the Counting-house
this morning if I was you, sir.’

Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a
leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some
recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred
and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the
Secretary of State for the Home Department. He was out of temper;
and he looked up with an angry scowl.

He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which
stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate
Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the
right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the
foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on
Hampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted
the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of
Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath
to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under
a hedge, and slept.

The two gentlemen watched Oliver’s earnest face, as he spoke, and
looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the
accuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any
appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was
long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had
crushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay;
but in no one place could they discern the print of men’s shoes, or
the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed
the ground for hours before.

So, Mr. Traveller went on, and on, and on, until he came to Tom Tiddler's
Ground.

‘My dear sir,’ said the Father, with a removal of his black cap and a
grasp of Clennam’s hand, combining to express the safe receipt of his
note and enclosure that afternoon, ‘Heaven ever bless you!’

Nephelo was a light-hearted subject of the Prince of Nimbus. It is he
who often floats, when the whole cloud is dark, as a white vapor on the
surface. For love of Cirrha, he came down behind a team of rain-drops
and leaped into the cistern of a handsome house at the west end of
London.

"Well; I suppose you went up to have a little talk about this
trial--eh, Mr. Weller?" said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking knowingly at the
jury.

“That awful scene was always before me.  I saw this devoted man day after
day, with the eyes of my imagination, sometimes destroying in his rage
the harmless looking-glass, which was the immediate cause of his
suffering, sometimes transfixed before the horrid image that turned him
to stone.  I recollect coming upon him once when we were stopping at a
roadside inn, and seeing him stand so by broad daylight.  His back was
turned towards me, and I waited and watched him for nearly half an hour
as he stood there motionless and speechless, and appearing not to
breathe.  I am not sure but that this apparition seen so by daylight was
more ghastly than that apparition seen in the middle of the night, with
the thunder rumbling among the hills.

"Well!" he replied, shaking the snow out of his long hair, "I was a
going to turn in somewheers."

*I.  HOW PIP HELPED THE CONVICT*

‘Say no more about it,’ said Mr. Pickwick, locking the pocket-book in
his desk; ‘I am heartily obliged to you, my good friend. Now sit down
again. I want to ask your advice.’

“No,” rejoined the old lady.

“Ah—h!” from Mrs. Snagsby.

CHAPTER VIII.

These gentlemen had not yet quite recovered the jest, when dinner was
announced, and then they were thrown into fresh ecstasies by a similar
cause; for Sir Mulberry Hawk, in an excess of humour, shot dexterously
past Lord Frederick Verisopht who was about to lead Kate downstairs, and
drew her arm through his up to the elbow.

*       *       *       *       *

"In its old place."

“I beg your pardon, miss!” said Mr. Guppy, rising when he saw me
rise. “But would you allow me the favour of a minute’s private
conversation?”

Whither go the clouds and wind so eagerly? If, like guilty spirits, they
repair to some dread conference with powers like themselves, in what
wild regions do the elements hold council, or where unbend in terrible
disport?

‘Yes, Poll, reether so. You can call it this morning, if you like to be
particular. He dined with us.’

‘Very well, sir,’ said Wilkins.

The man got no farther, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew
the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.

‘The girls,’ said Traddles. ‘Sophy’s sisters. They are staying with us.
They have come to have a peep at London. The fact is, when--was it you
that tumbled upstairs, Copperfield?’

Noah's shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a
louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen
by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was
quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life
to come further down.

*AIRSHIP CRUISING FROM SILVER FOX FARM.*

The chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with
which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle
with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till
he cried.

[Sidenote: Mr. Henry F. Chorley.]

Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed, relented a little and faltered,
what did Mr. Bucket mean.

‘Shall I tell him so, and only ask him for money enough to enable us by
the cheapest means to reach New York, or any port from which we may hope
to get a passage home, by serving in any capacity? Explaining to him
at the same time how I am connected, and that I will endeavour to
repay him, even through my grandfather, immediately on our arrival in
England?’

"Which other?"

Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at
full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in
it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality,--of the constrained
effort of the _ennuyé_ man of the world. A glance, however, at his
countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for
some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half
of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,
in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that
I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me
with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face
had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye
large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and
very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate
Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar
formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence,
of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and
tenuity;--these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions
of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be
forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character
of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay
so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor
of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things
startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to
grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated
rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect
its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.

The fat boy, with elephantine playfulness, stretched out his arms to
ravish a kiss; but as it required no great agility to elude him, his
fair enslaver had vanished before he closed them again; upon which
the apathetic youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental
countenance, and fell fast asleep.

Having all protested that they had left off, some thirty, some forty,
and some fifty years, according to their respective ages, and the marine
officer saying that he never had had any practice at all, having been
brought up by hand, the gallant and disappointed hero was obliged to
order the boatswain's mates to pass the word fore and aft, to send every
one to him who knew how to milk a cow.

Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is
uncertain. It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at
it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her
first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.

I had not gone fifty paces along the street when I was suddenly brought
up by the sight of a man who got out of a little phaeton at the doctor’s
door, and went into the doctor’s house.  Immediately, the air was filled
with the scent of trodden grass, and the perspective of years opened, and
at the end of it was a little likeness of this man keeping a wicket, and
I said, ‘God bless my soul!  Joe Specks!’

Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.
Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took
Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.

‘What DO you mean?’ said Joe. ‘Don’t you see Mr Edward doesn’t
understand, father?’

‘Go!’ exclaimed the Dodger. ‘Why, where’s your spirit?’ Don’t you
take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on
your friends?’

“Say it then.” The lawyer turns, leans his arms on the iron railing
at the top of the steps, and looks at the lamplighter lighting the
court-yard.

‘Pretty well, sir, and hope you gentlemen are going to treat us ladies,
now you have come to see us.’

THE OLD MAN'S TALE ABOUT THE QUEER CLIENT

It is their station to work.  And they _do_ work.  They labour in these
mills, upon an average, twelve hours a day, which is unquestionably work,
and pretty tight work too.  Perhaps it is above their station to indulge
in such amusements, on any terms.  Are we quite sure that we in England
have not formed our ideas of the ‘station’ of working people, from
accustoming ourselves to the contemplation of that class as they are, and
not as they might be? I think that if we examine our own feelings, we
shall find that the pianos, and the circulating libraries, and even the
Lowell Offering, startle us by their novelty, and not by their bearing
upon any abstract question of right or wrong.

“These are hard words, uncle!”

"Are they bright, though?" returned Dora, laughing. "I'm so glad they're
bright."

‘Tim,’ said brother Charles, ‘you understand that we have an intention
of taking this young gentleman into the counting-house?’

Parting from his companions, after arranging another meeting with
Mr Meagles, Clennam went alone into the entry, and knocked with his
knuckles at the parlour-door. It was opened presently by a woman with
a child in her arms, whose unoccupied hand was hastily rearranging the
upper part of her dress. This was Mrs Plornish, and this maternal
action was the action of Mrs Plornish during a large part of her waking
existence.

“Mrs Dombey and myself,” said Mr Dombey, passing this compliment with
august self-denial, “are not quite agreed upon some points. We do not
appear to understand each other yet. Mrs Dombey has something to
learn.”

The well-remembered ground was soon traversed, and I came into the
quiet streets, where every stone was a boy's book to me. I went on
foot to the old house, and went away with a heart too full to enter.
I returned; and looking, as I passed, through the low window of the
turret-room where first Uriah Heep, and afterwards Mr. Micawber, had
been wont to sit, saw that it was a little parlor now, and that there
was no office. Otherwise the staid old house was, as to its cleanliness
and order, still just as it had been when I first saw it. I requested
the new maid who admitted me, to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman
who waited on her from a friend abroad, was there; and I was shown
up the grave old staircase (cautioned of the steps I knew so well),
into the unchanged drawing-room. The books that Agnes and I had read
together, were on their shelves; and the desk where I had labored at my
lessons, many a night, stood yet at the same old corner of the table.
All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there,
were changed again. Everything was as it used to be, in the happy time.

“I know not. I have been bewildered. It is strange; but from the moment
I saw you at Count Selka’s, a powerful instinct of love overcame me; not
a new feeling; but as if some latent, long-hid, undeveloped sentiment
had suddenly burst forth into an uncontrollable passion. I love, I adore
you. I----”

How long they might have continued in this undeniable state of bliss
would be an useless guess, for the last of Jacob's friends--and he
was no sudden faller-off--had scarcely deposited himself upon the
ground in happy indifference for his clothes, when the cracked-bell
voice of Mrs. Tibs, who had unexpectedly returned, roused the maid
into a consciousness that missus had come home! Domestic contentions
are at no time an interesting theme; and as most of our readers--we
allude to the married portion--have doubtless experienced them in
real life, romance would fall far short of the truth; the single we
advise to marry, and experience will teach them what we here pass
over. When Jacob's better half beheld her bottles empty, her casks
upturned, and her husband, for the first time since he had enjoyed
that felicity, deaf to the music of her voice, a bucket of water from
the well refreshed Jacob to a truth he would willingly have slept in
ignorance of,--that the wife of his bosom was alive, and he started as
a thief would at an opening door. She seized him by the collar, and,
showering the first-fruits of her passion upon him who could so well
appreciate it, the "boatswain" rose within her, and, after bestowing
sundry terms of approbation upon his boon companions, she turned them
out of the house, as the vulgar saying hath it, "with their tails
between their legs." Jacob would have slunk away, but Fortune willed it
otherwise. His "rib" shouted the word of command, "Tack, you lubber,
and be ---- to you!" Jacob recognised the voice,--how could he have
mistaken it?--and waited for orders. Now it so fell out, as Mrs. Tibs
ran for the bucket of water, her cap, in the press of business, caught
by a twig, dropped into the well, and eighteen-pence had been that day
expended in decoration. With the assistance of Nanny the maid, Jacob
was to be wound down in the bucket; and, spite of his appeals to the
contrary, with one foot in the tub, and both hands on the rope, he was
lowered, and half soused in water, until he reached the ribbon treasure
of his wife's head. The cap clutched in one hand, he was raised
dripping by the windlass. Each twist brought him nearer to the top,
when, sorrowful to relate, the rope gave way, and Jacob dropped like
lead into the well; a hollow splash was heard in the water, and Mrs
Tibs stood by in speechless agony. At length her grief found vent, and,
pitching her voice to its shrillest note, she cried, "Oh, my cap!"

‘Mobbs’s step-mother,’ said Squeers, ‘took to her bed on hearing that he
wouldn’t eat fat, and has been very ill ever since. She wishes to know,
by an early post, where he expects to go to, if he quarrels with
his vittles; and with what feelings he could turn up his nose at the
cow’s-liver broth, after his good master had asked a blessing on it.
This was told her in the London newspapers--not by Mr. Squeers, for he is
too kind and too good to set anybody against anybody--and it has vexed
her so much, Mobbs can’t think. She is sorry to find he is discontented,
which is sinful and horrid, and hopes Mr. Squeers will flog him into
a happier state of mind; with which view, she has also stopped his
halfpenny a week pocket-money, and given a double-bladed knife with a
corkscrew in it to the Missionaries, which she had bought on purpose for
him.’

‘It’s a deal too good to be married in, master,’ rejoined Peg, after
a short inspection of the suit. ‘Haven’t you got anything worse than
this?’

Hence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder
as if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure. He feels
that for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically
twitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere,
but he thinks, “We have all yielded to this; it belongs to us; it has
for some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make
the vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms; and I
submit myself to the compromise.”

‘Well,’ said Wegg, contemptuously, though, perhaps, perceiving some hint
of danger otherwise, ‘keep it from your old lady. I ain’t going to tell
her. I can have you under close inspection without that. I’m as good a
man as you, and better. Ask me to dinner. Give me the run of your ’ouse.
I was good enough for you and your old lady once, when I helped you out
with your weal and hammers. Was there no Miss Elizabeth, Master George,
Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker, before YOU two?’

Even the slightest turns of Sterne's pen bear inspiration.  No less
a critic than the severe Hazlitt was satisfied that "his works
consist only of brilliant passages."

‘If you had said I was another father to Tom—young Tom, I mean, not my
friend Tom Gradgrind—you might have been nearer the mark.  I am going to
take young Tom into my office.  Going to have him under my wing, ma’am.’

It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.
There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish
apothecary’s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick
out of a quill.

‘Very,’ said his three friends.

For the first time since I left you I am sitting in a room of my own
hiring, with a fire and a bed in it. And I am happy to say that I have
the best and fullest intentions of sleeping in the bed, having arrived
here at half-past four this afternoon, without any cessation of
travelling, night or day, since I parted from Mr. Bairr's cheap
firewood.

‘Nothing,’ replied Mr. Brownlow, ‘nothing to you. But it was _hers_,
and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man,
the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a
stranger. I am very glad you have changed it--very--very.’

They were addressed on the back ‘To every Protestant into whose hands
this shall come,’ and bore within what follows:

She did not raise her voice above her breath, or address us, but said
this to the night sky; then stood profoundly quiet, looking at the
gloomy water.

I observed Agnes turn pale, as she looked very attentively at my aunt.
My aunt, patting her cat, looked very attentively at Agnes.

‘Mother, shall I do nothing to assist you?’

No. I couldn't think of agreeing to it. I was very sorry, but there was
a higher consideration than sense. Love was above all earthly
considerations, and I loved Dora to idolatry, and Dora loved me. I
didn't exactly say so; I softened it down as much as I could; but I
implied it, and I was resolute upon it. I don't think I made myself very
ridiculous, but I know I was resolute.

"Yes, certainly; if you don't mind waiting a moment for me to put
my things on."

‘And that fifteen or twenty years ago stood in a park five times as
broad, which with other and richer property has bit by bit changed hands
and dwindled away--more’s the pity!’ pursued the young man.

There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last
words, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a
loss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by
dismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the
walnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my
home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by
_that_ motion.

‘Well, sir,’ returned Mark, quite unmoved by this intelligence ‘from all
that ever I heard about it, I should say America is a very likely sort
of place for me to be jolly in!’

But now a fearful circumstance occurs.

‘They were wrong,’ he said.

So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in
their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,
looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and
came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left
leg in both arms.

‘And the dancer, Amy, that she has quite forgotten--the dancer who bore
no sort of resemblance to me, and of whom I never remind her, oh dear
no!--should dance through her life, and dance in her way, to such a tune
as would disturb her insolent placidity a little. Just a little, my dear
Amy, just a little!’

"Come, fellow partner," said Uriah, "if I may take the liberty,--now,
suppose you give us something or another appropriate to Copperfield!"

“Why—why?” interrupted the Jew triumphantly. “Tell him that.”

"She was a charming woman, sir!" he observed in a plaintive manner.

‘One remark,’ said Flora, giving their conversation, without the
slightest notice and to the great terror of Clennam, the tone of a
love-quarrel, ‘I wish to make, one explanation I wish to offer, when
your Mama came and made a scene of it with my Papa and when I was called
down into the little breakfast-room where they were looking at one
another with your Mama’s parasol between them seated on two chairs like
mad bulls what was I to do?’

When her term of mourning had expired, Madeline gave her hand and
fortune to Nicholas; and, on the same day and at the same time, Kate
became Mrs. Frank Cheeryble. It was expected that Tim Linkinwater and
Miss La Creevy would have made a third couple on the occasion, but
they declined, and two or three weeks afterwards went out together one
morning before breakfast, and, coming back with merry faces, were found
to have been quietly married that day.

The lady of the house appeared shortly afterwards, and Mr. Mincin’s
friendliness, as will readily be supposed, suffered no diminution in
consequence; he exerted much strength and skill in wheeling a large
easy-chair up to the fire, and the lady being seated in it, carefully
closed the door, stirred the fire, and looked to the windows to see that
they admitted no air; having satisfied himself upon all these points, he
expressed himself quite easy in his mind, and begged to know how she
found herself to-day.  Upon the lady’s replying very well, Mr. Mincin
(who it appeared was a medical gentleman) offered some general remarks
upon the nature and treatment of colds in the head, which occupied us
agreeably until dinner-time.  During the meal, he devoted himself to
complimenting everybody, not forgetting himself, so that we were an
uncommonly agreeable quartette.

“Good Heaven, Mrs Dombey!” said her husband, with supreme amazement,
“do you imagine it possible that I could ever listen to such a
proposition? Do you know who I am, Madam? Do you know what I represent?
Did you ever hear of Dombey and Son? People to say that Mr Dombey—Mr
Dombey!—was separated from his wife! Common people to talk of Mr Dombey
and his domestic affairs! Do you seriously think, Mrs Dombey, that I
would permit my name to be banded about in such connexion? Pooh, pooh,
Madam! Fie for shame! You’re absurd.” Mr Dombey absolutely laughed.

He might perhaps have gone on to reflect that of all mornings in the
year, it was not the best calculated for a young lady’s coming forth
on such an errand, either. But he was stopped on the road to this
reflection, if his thoughts tended that way, by her appearance at a
short distance, on which he hurried forward to meet her. Her squire,
Mr Tapley, at the same time fell discreetly back, and surveyed the fog
above him with an appearance of attentive interest.

You may suppose, from seeing my name in the printed letter you have
received, that I am favourable to the proposed society. I am decidedly
opposed to it. I went there on the day I was in the chair, after much
solicitation; and being put into it, opened the proceedings by telling
the meeting that I approved of the design in theory, but in practice
considered it hopeless. I may tell you--I did not tell them--that the
nature of the meeting, and the character and position of many of the men
attending it, cried "Failure" trumpet-tongued in my ears. To quote an
expression from Tennyson, I may say that if it were the best society in
the world, the grossness of some natures in it would have weight to drag
it down.

‘Never mind what you didn’t intend,’ John Westlock interposed. ‘What you
DID intend is more to the purpose. You intended, in coming here, to ask
my advice, did you not, Tom?’

The night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the
marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was
piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken;
for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him
into conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the
cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange
objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as
if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.

Mr Chester, having extolled his favourite author, as above recited,
took up the book again in the excess of his admiration and was composing
himself for a further perusal of its sublime morality, when he was
disturbed by a noise at the outer door; occasioned as it seemed by the
endeavours of his servant to obstruct the entrance of some unwelcome
visitor.

“I looked in here,” he observes, “just before you, with the
intention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some
employment at his trade of copying. I had heard of him from my
stationer—Snagsby of Cook’s Court. Since no one here knows anything
about him, it might be as well to send for Snagsby. Ah!” to the
little crazy woman, who has often seen him in court, and whom he has
often seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the
law-stationer. “Suppose you do!”

‘Double-locked and chained,’ replied Crackit, who, with the other
two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.

Nothing could have been more in accordance with Sam Weller’s feelings
than the projected exposure of the real propensities and qualities of
the red-nosed man; and it being very near the appointed hour of meeting,
the father and son took their way at once to Brick Lane, Sam not
forgetting to drop his letter into a general post-office as they walked
along.

It must be acknowledged that, asleep or awake, Tom’s position in
reference to this young lady was full of uneasiness. The more he saw
of her, the more he admired her beauty, her intelligence, the amiable
qualities that even won on the divided house of Pecksniff, and in a
few days restored, at all events, the semblance of harmony and kindness
between the angry sisters. When she spoke, Tom held his breath, so
eagerly he listened; when she sang, he sat like one entranced. She
touched his organ, and from that bright epoch even it, the old companion
of his happiest hours, incapable as he had thought of elevation, began a
new and deified existence.

On the morning of the 9th he wrote to his sister, and then arraying
himself in his new wedding suit, and putting the emerald ring on his
finger, he appeared all impatience, until toward evening, when he
sallied out on horseback to his appointment. It seems that his
mysterious inamorata had met him, for he was seen riding through the
big town before sunset, with a young lady behind him, dressed in white
and green, and the villagers affirmed that they were riding at the
rate of fifty miles an hour! They were seen to pass a cottage called
Mosskilt, ten miles farther on, where there was no highway, at the
same tremendous speed; and I could never hear that they were any more
seen, until the following morning, when Birkendelly's fine bay horse
was found lying dead at his own stable door; and shortly after his
master was likewise discovered lying, a blackened corpse, on the Birky
Brow at the very spot where the mysterious but lovely dame had always
appeared to him. There was neither wound, bruise, nor dislocation in
his whole frame; but his skin was of a livid color, and his features
terribly distorted.

Mr. Vholes, after glancing at the official cat who is patiently
watching a mouse’s hole, fixes his charmed gaze again on his young
client and proceeds in his buttoned-up, half-audible voice as if
there were an unclean spirit in him that will neither come out nor
speak out, “What are you to do, sir, you inquire, during the
vacation. I should hope you gentlemen of the army may find many means
of amusing yourselves if you give your minds to it. If you had asked
me what I was to do during the vacation, I could have answered you
more readily. I am to attend to your interests. I am to be found
here, day by day, attending to your interests. That is my duty, Mr.
C., and term-time or vacation makes no difference to me. If you wish
to consult me as to your interests, you will find me here at all
times alike. Other professional men go out of town. I don’t. Not that
I blame them for going; I merely say I don’t go. This desk is your
rock, sir!”

"Well, Grummet," said the skipper, "what now?"

‘And there were Six old men upon the stairs!’

Occupying the post I now do, I feel something like a counsel for the
plaintiff with nobody on the other side; but even if I had been placed in
that position ninety times nine, it would still be my duty to state a few
facts from the very short brief with which I have been provided.

‘For what?’ demanded Monks.

"I knowed it!" said Mr. Roker, with a chuckle, when Mr. Pickwick stated
the object with which he had returned. "Didn't I say so, Neddy?"

‘To hang himself!’ repeated Mr. Lillyvick.

‘But let us see,’ he said, thoughtfully. ‘Were we talking? Was it you
and me? Where have we been?’

The butler laughed a horse-laugh, and made a standing joke of Andy's
split spoon; but time and experience made Andy less impressed with
wonder at the show of plate and glass, and the split spoons became
familiar as 'household words' to him; yet still there were things in
the duties of table attendance beyond Andy's comprehension,--he used to
hand cold plates for fish, and hot plates for jelly, &c. But 'one day,'
as Zanga says,--'one day' he was thrown off his centre in a remarkable
degree by a bottle of soda water.

“Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”

“Yes, guv’ner.”

“Not long gone seven,” said the girl. “How do you feel tonight, Bill?”

Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing
the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern
which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the
heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old
table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.

"_I_ think two witnesses would be more lawful," said Mrs. Sanders, who,
like the other friend, was bursting with curiosity.

“What? You WILL, will you?”

His mother was not a little startled on learning what service was
required of her, and presently fell into a confusion of ideas, of which
the most prominent were that it was a great honour and dignity to ride
in a post-chaise, and that it was a moral impossibility to leave the
children behind.  But this objection, and a great many others, founded
on certain articles of dress being at the wash, and certain other
articles having no existence in the wardrobe of Mrs Nubbles, were
overcome by Kit, who opposed to each and every of them, the pleasure of
recovering Nell, and the delight it would be to bring her back in
triumph.

This description applies to the river-frontage of the Six Jolly
Fellowship Porters. The back of the establishment, though the chief
entrance was there, so contracted that it merely represented in its
connexion with the front, the handle of a flat iron set upright on its
broadest end. This handle stood at the bottom of a wilderness of court
and alley: which wilderness pressed so hard and close upon the Six Jolly
Fellowship Porters as to leave the hostelry not an inch of ground beyond
its door. For this reason, in combination with the fact that the house
was all but afloat at high water, when the Porters had a family wash the
linen subjected to that operation might usually be seen drying on lines
stretched across the reception-rooms and bed-chambers.

‘Do you think, sir,’ he asked the turnkey, ‘that she will be very much
shocked, if she should come to the gate to-morrow morning?’

‘Child!’ cried Mantalini, hurrying in. ‘How came--eh!--oh--demmit, how
d’ye do?’

‘No?’

“I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him,
there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver’s
little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye,
and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.”

‘I brought this card from the General Agency Office, sir,’ said
Nicholas, ‘wishing to offer myself as your secretary, and understanding
that you stood in need of one.’

Poor Plorn is gone to Australia. It was a hard parting at the last. He
seemed to me to become once more my youngest and favourite little child
as the day drew near, and I did not think I could have been so shaken.
You were his idol to the hour of his departure, and he asked me to tell
you how much he wanted to bid you good-bye.

‘It’s a large party,’ sighed the unhappy godfather, wiping the
perspiration from his forehead, and leaning against the area-railings.
It was some time before the miserable man could muster up courage to
knock at the door, and when he did, the smart appearance of a
neighbouring greengrocer (who had been hired to wait for seven and
sixpence, and whose calves alone were worth double the money), the lamp
in the passage, and the Venus on the landing, added to the hum of many
voices, and the sound of a harp and two violins, painfully convinced
him that his surmises were but too well founded.

The child and the old man sat alone
    In the quiet, peaceful shade
  Of the old green boughs, that had richly grown
    In the deep, thick forest glade.
  It was a soft and pleasant sound,
    That rustling of the oak;
  And the gentle breeze played lightly round,
    As thus the fair boy spoke:--

WE all dined together that day; and a rather formidable party we were: no
fewer than eighty-six strong.  The vessel being pretty deep in the water,
with all her coals on board and so many passengers, and the weather being
calm and quiet, there was but little motion; so that before the dinner
was half over, even those passengers who were most distrustful of
themselves plucked up amazingly; and those who in the morning had
returned to the universal question, ‘Are you a good sailor?’ a very
decided negative, now either parried the inquiry with the evasive reply,
‘Oh! I suppose I’m no worse than anybody else;’ or, reckless of all moral
obligations, answered boldly ‘Yes:’ and with some irritation too, as
though they would add, ‘I should like to know what you see in _me_, sir,
particularly, to justify suspicion!’

The "FLYING BOYS" Series

“Wishermaydie if I seen Tom-all-Alone’s till this blessed morning,”
replies Jo hoarsely.

“I am not accustomed, Carker, as you know,” said Mr Dombey, “to give
such close reasons for any course of conduct I think proper to adopt,
but I will gainsay nothing of this. If you have any objection to found
upon it, that is indeed another thing, and the mere statement that you
have one will be sufficient. But I have not supposed, I confess, that
any confidence I could entrust to you, would be likely to degrade you—”

It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered and wiped the
perspiration from his brow.

“She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched
on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself
aloof,” said Sikes. “We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one
way or other, it’s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here
so long has made her restless—eh?”

‘Altro, altro! Not Ri----’ Before John Baptist could finish the name, his
comrade had got his hand under his chin and fiercely shut up his mouth.

"Most certainly," was the reply.

On the 11th of December, a friend came to his house as he was sitting
by his wife's bed, to which she was confined by illness, and when, with
much difficulty, he had descended to the parlour, told him with great
care and delicacy that his son was dead.

‘It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down
upon,’ said Blathers. ‘This here Conkey Chickweed--’

‘Did you remain long at Yarmouth, that time?’

The woman looked, first at Nicholas, and then at Mr. Mantalini, as
if uncertain on whom to visit this extraordinary behaviour; but Mr
Mantalini happening by ill-luck to thrust his nose from under the
bedclothes, in his anxiety to ascertain whether the visitors were gone,
she suddenly, and with a dexterity which could only have been acquired
by long practice, flung a pretty heavy clothes-basket at him, with so
good an aim that he kicked more violently than before, though without
venturing to make any effort to disengage his head, which was quite
extinguished. Thinking this a favourable opportunity for departing
before any of the torrent of her wrath discharged itself upon him,
Nicholas hurried Kate off, and left the unfortunate subject of this
unexpected recognition to explain his conduct as he best could.

“Oh, my dear Paul, no,” said Mrs Chick, who had much ado to keep her
teeth from chattering; “not for me.”

Lamps was beginning, “Not particular so”—when his daughter took him up.

There was a pewter inkstand on the chimney-piece, with some mildewed
remains of ink in the bottle.  There were two coarse china ornaments of
the commonest kind; and there was a square of embossed card, dirty and
fly-blown, with a collection of wretched riddles printed on it, in all
sorts of zig-zag directions, and in variously coloured inks.  He took the
card, and went away, to read it, to the table on which the candle was
placed; sitting down, with his back resolutely turned to the curtained
bed.

"--Will, I fear, madam, but create fresh sorrow. In fact----"

‘Oh, very well,’ rejoined Mr. Anthony Humm, retreating a few paces.

The old man, muttering some words softly, rose as if he would have gone
himself, but Jonas thrust him back into his chair with an impatient
imprecation, and sent a servant-girl to fetch her. When he had charged
her with her errand he walked to and fro again, and never stopped till
she came back, which she did pretty soon; the way being short, and the
woman having made good haste.

Consequently, the principal use to which the cookery-book was devoted,
was being put down in the corner for Jip to stand upon. But Dora was so
pleased, when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to
come off, and at the same time to hold the pencil-case in his mouth,
that I was very glad I had bought it.

Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of
firearms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over
uneven ground at a rapid pace.  And then, the noises grew confused in
the distance.  A cold deadly feeling crept over the boy's heart, and he
saw or heard no more.

‘To be sure,’ rejoined Daniel. ‘Why not?’

Trotty's first excess of fear was gone. But he had felt tenderly and
gratefully toward the Bells, as you have seen; and when he heard himself
arraigned as one who had offended them so weightily, his heart was
touched with penitence and grief.

‘Prime!’ said the young gentleman.

‘Let him see,’ said the irritated young lady, when she had regained her
own room, and eased her mind by committing an assault on Phib, ‘if I
don’t set mother against him a little more when she comes back!’

The coachman employs himself in twisting the lash of his whip into a
knot, and takes no more notice of the question: clearly signifying that
it is anybody’s business but his, and that the passengers would do well
to fix it, among themselves.  In this state of things, matters seem to be
approximating to a fix of another kind, when another inside passenger in
a corner, who is nearly suffocated, cries faintly, ‘I’ll get out.’

‘I don’t know, John.’

"Do you see him here, now?" said the judge.

Anne, Mrs. Dickens's maid, i. 72, 414; ii. 18, 25, 28, 343

‘I can’t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,’ said
Blathers; ‘but my opinion at once is,--I don’t mind committing
myself to that extent,--that this wasn’t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?’

As Mr Dombey acknowledged the compliment with a bend of his head, the
younger lady glancing at him, met his eyes.

"Your regulation is rather awkward to strangers," said Miss Murdstone.

Before I quit this Palace of the Popes, let me translate from the little
history I mentioned just now, a short anecdote, quite appropriate to
itself, connected with its adventures.

The lucky individual whose name was called, snapped up the morsel
thrown towards him, but none of the others moved a muscle.  In this
manner they were fed at the discretion of their master.  Meanwhile the
dog in disgrace ground hard at the organ, sometimes in quick time,
sometimes in slow, but never leaving off for an instant.  When the
knives and forks rattled very much, or any of his fellows got an
unusually large piece of fat, he accompanied the music with a short
howl, but he immediately checked it on his master looking round, and
applied himself with increased diligence to the Old Hundredth.

Faithfully yours ever.

"I should have thought," said I, smiling, "that that was a reason for
your being in here too, Ham."

He patronised Mechi's razor-strops and Hubert's roseate powder, in
consequence of which all the lower features of his face became a mass of
purulent offence.

‘Capital, madam, capital,’ urged Mr. Micawber, gloomily.

‘I thought you had settled, Mr Rugg,’ said Arthur, ‘that my
determination to remain here was a matter of taste.’

He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, lifted up his hands; and with
the same smooth smile, which was not a pleasant one to see, cast his
eyes upon the ground, and remained silent.

Such was my brother's harangue. Sick of his prosing I left his
house, comforting myself that I had, at least, as much chance of
the appointment as he had; nor was I altogether without my hopes of
supplanting him with Maria, though _he_ might be worthy of wedding her
at Marylebone; and I, even with her own special licence, would have to
journey on the same errand as far as Gretna.

‘Hallo!’ he said, standing on tip-toe on the window-sill, and looking
down into the room.  ‘Is there anybody at home?  Is there any of the
Devil’s ware here?  Is Brass at a premium, eh?’

‘With four horses I declare!’ said Kit, quite aghast at the
preparations.  ‘Well you ARE going to do it, mother!  Here she is, Sir.
Here’s my mother.  She’s quite ready, sir.’

He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that
he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very
first village through which he passed. He had walked no more than
twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his
legs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in
the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey
next morning he could hardly crawl along.

‘It’s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,’ replied Mr. Bumble,
‘who has been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young
Twist.’

“That was not my meaning,” returns Sir Leicester. “I am glad to hear
you say so. I would suggest that as you think her worthy of your
patronage, you should exert your influence to keep her from these
dangerous hands. You might show her what violence would be done in
such association to her duties and principles, and you might preserve
her for a better fate. You might point out to her that she probably
would, in good time, find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom she would
not be—” Sir Leicester adds, after a moment’s consideration,
“dragged from the altars of her forefathers.”

He was scarcely gone, leaving the Duke of York Regent in his absence,
when his cousin, Henry of Hereford, came over from France to claim the
rights of which he had been so monstrously deprived. He was immediately
joined by the two great Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland; and
his uncle, the Regent, finding the King’s cause unpopular, and the
disinclination of the army to act against Henry, very strong, withdrew
with the Royal forces towards Bristol. Henry, at the head of an army,
came from Yorkshire (where he had landed) to London and followed him.
They joined their forces—how they brought that about, is not distinctly
understood—and proceeded to Bristol Castle, whither three noblemen had
taken the young Queen. The castle surrendering, they presently put
those three noblemen to death. The Regent then remained there, and
Henry went on to Chester.

With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,
without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.

"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner," interrupted Scrooge's
niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have
been competent judges, because they had just had dinner, and with the
dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.

Edward, afterwards called by the monks The Confessor, succeeded; and
his first act was to oblige his mother Emma, who had favoured him so
little, to retire into the country; where she died some ten years
afterwards. He was the exiled prince whose brother Alfred had been so
foully killed. He had been invited over from Normandy by Hardicanute,
in the course of his short reign of two years, and had been handsomely
treated at court. His cause was now favoured by the powerful Earl
Godwin, and he was soon made King. This Earl had been suspected by the
people, ever since Prince Alfred’s cruel death; he had even been tried
in the last reign for the Prince’s murder, but had been pronounced not
guilty; chiefly, as it was supposed, because of a present he had made
to the swinish King, of a gilded ship with a figure-head of solid gold,
and a crew of eighty splendidly armed men. It was his interest to help
the new King with his power, if the new King would help him against the
popular distrust and hatred. So they made a bargain. Edward the
Confessor got the Throne. The Earl got more power and more land, and
his daughter Editha was made queen; for it was a part of their compact
that the King should take her for his wife.

Meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily. Isabella Wardle and
Mr. Trundle "went partners," and Emily Wardle and Mr. Snodgrass did
the same; and even Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt established a
joint-stock company of fish and flattery. Old Mr. Wardle was in the
very height of his jollity; and he was _so_ funny in his management of
the board, and the old ladies were _so_ sharp after their winnings,
that the whole table was in a perpetual roar of merriment and laughter.
There was one old lady who always had about half-a-dozen cards to pay
for, at which everybody laughed, regularly every round; and when the
old lady looked cross at having to pay, they laughed louder than ever;
on which the old lady's face gradually brightened up, till at last
she laughed louder than any of them. Then, when the spinster aunt got
"matrimony," the young ladies laughed afresh, and the spinster aunt
seemed disposed to be pettish; till, feeling Mr. Tupman squeezing
her hand under the table, _she_ brightened up too, and looked rather
knowing, as if matrimony in reality were not quite so far off as some
people thought for; whereupon everybody laughed again, and especially
old Mr. Wardle, who enjoyed a joke as much as the youngest. As to
Mr. Snodgrass, he did nothing but whisper poetical sentiments into
his partner's ear, which made one old gentleman facetiously sly,
about partnerships at cards and partnerships for life, and caused the
aforesaid old gentleman to make some remarks thereupon, accompanied
with divers winks and chuckles, which made the company very merry and
the old gentleman's wife especially so. And Mr. Winkle came out with
jokes which are very well known in town, but are not at all known in
the country: and as everybody laughed at them very heartily, and said
they were very capital, Mr. Winkle was in a state of great honour and
glory. And the benevolent clergyman looked pleasantly on; for the happy
faces which surrounded the table made the good old man feel happy too;
and though the merriment was rather boisterous, still it came from the
heart and not from the lips: and this is the right sort of merriment
after all.

‘I am glad to see your sister, Miss Dorrit. I did not remember that you
had a sister.’

“And I only wish we’d a jury of the independent sort in the house for a
week or two,” said the beadle; “the rules and regulations of the board
would soon bring their spirit down for them.”

"Why, _you_ have," returned Traddles.

‘But what can I do?’ said Rose. ‘To what use can I turn this
communication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to
companions you paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this
information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the
next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half
an hour’s delay.’

Ever most affectionately.

MY DEAR MACREADY,

“And Wal”r’s drownded,” said the Captain. “Ain’t he?”

‘Madam,’ said Mr Dorrit, recovering his breath by a great effort, as the
relict of the late Mr Finching stopped to take hers; ‘madam,’ said Mr
Dorrit, very red in the face, ‘if I understand you to refer to--ha--to
anything in the antecedents of--hum--a daughter of mine, involving--ha
hum--daily compensation, madam, I beg to observe that the--ha--fact,
assuming it--ha--to be fact, never was within my knowledge. Hum. I
should not have permitted it. Ha. Never! Never!’

It was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and
stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak,
or rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had
passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of
tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a
full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost
insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.

The short papers which are to be found at the beginning of the volume
were indispensable to the form of publication and the limited extent of
each number, as no story of length or interest could be begun until “The
Clock was wound up and fairly going.”

‘But you must bring only him, and none other. And though you wait at
his door a whole day and night, still you must wait, and not come back
without him.’

The dust has gathered on it--
There are so few who care
To read what Time has written
Of joy and sorrow there.

‘Companion? That’s just what I want to be to-day, Pa.’

Turning these things in his mind, as he mounted the narrow staircase
at the foot of which Roker had left him, Mr. Pickwick gradually worked
himself to the boiling-over point; and so excited was he with his
reflections on this subject, that he had burst into the room to which
he had been directed, before he had any distinct recollection, either
of the place in which he was, or of the object of his visit.

Number Three looked like a very short manuscript, and I said as much.
Jarber explained to me that we were to have some poetry this time.  In
the course of his investigations he had stepped into the Circulating
Library, to seek for information on the one important subject.  All the
Library-people knew about the House was, that a female relative of the
last tenant, as they believed, had, just after that tenant left, sent a
little manuscript poem to them which she described as referring to events
that had actually passed in the House; and which she wanted the
proprietor of the Library to publish.  She had written no address on her
letter; and the proprietor had kept the manuscript ready to be given back
to her (the publishing of poems not being in his line) when she might
call for it.  She had never called for it; and the poem had been lent to
Jarber, at his express request, to read to me.

‘Would you please to come directly, sir. We found that, lying on the
table.’

"'Oh!' said I, 'the cabin's well enough for a loose lad like me.
Everything here is rough and ready; and, as it's a bachelor's shop, you
must make allowances.'

"Who, Joe, who? None of the servants, I hope?"

We turn with sorrow to the other contents of the pamphlet. As the
pamphlet of the Association we are bound to show why it can only damage
the cause of the Association with the government and with the public;
we would have wholly spared the writer our present exposure of her
mistake, if we could.

Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at
heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small
ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her,
and retired.

But we must put an end to this agreeable conference,--though we think,
that if we could for ever listen to such vivid gossip, we should never
grow old. We had intended to have treated of the romantic intimacy,
and subsequent determined hatred, that existed between Lady Mary and
Pope; but our limits warn us that we must not indulge in a lengthy
discussion of the subject. She, it is clear, was flattered by his wit
and his mental beauty. In him real passion took root. His advances
she appears to have repulsed, and he was thus suddenly driven to the
galling contemplation of his own person, and he at once from the adoring
poet became the "Deformed Transformed" into hate itself. Byron never
forgave an allusion to his lameness. The separation of Mr. Wortley from
his accomplished wife still remains unexplained; but it is clear that
kindly and respectful feelings were preserved unblemished between them;
and there is a delicate tenderness in each towards the other in the
veriest trifles, which shows how feeble a thing is absence over sincere
affections. We are rather surprised that no letters from Lady Mary to
her grand-daughter Lady Jane, (one of the daughters of the Countess of
Bute,) have not straggled into print. How beautifully must she have
written to children, and particularly to such a child as Lady Jane
appears to have been! The letters, however, we fear are lost.

"Very well," said Tom; "where is it to be?"

His Majesty remarked, with some approach to severity, on the neglect of
delicacy and taste, gradually introduced into the trade by the new
school: a profligate and inferior race of impostors who took jobs at
almost any price, to the detriment of the old school, and the confusion
of their own misguided employers.  He considered that the trade was
overdone with competition, and observed speaking of his subjects, ‘There
are too many of ’em.’  He believed, still, that things were a little
better than they had been; adducing, as a proof, the fact that particular
posting places were now reserved, by common consent, for particular
posters; those places, however, must be regularly occupied by those
posters, or, they lapsed and fell into other hands.  It was of no use
giving a man a Drury Lane bill this week and not next.  Where was it to
go?  He was of opinion that going to the expense of putting up your own
board on which your sticker could display your own bills, was the only
complete way of posting yourself at the present time; but, even to effect
this, on payment of a shilling a week to the keepers of steamboat piers
and other such places, you must be able, besides, to give orders for
theatres and public exhibitions, or you would be sure to be cut out by
somebody.  His Majesty regarded the passion for orders, as one of the
most unappeasable appetites of human nature.  If there were a building,
or if there were repairs, going on, anywhere, you could generally stand
something and make it right with the foreman of the works; but, orders
would be expected from you, and the man who could give the most orders
was the man who would come off best.  There was this other objectionable
point, in orders, that workmen sold them for drink, and often sold them
to persons who were likewise troubled with the weakness of thirst: which
led (His Majesty said) to the presentation of your orders at Theatre
doors, by individuals who were ‘too shakery’ to derive intellectual
profit from the entertainments, and who brought a scandal on you.
Finally, His Majesty said that you could hardly put too little in a
poster; what you wanted, was, two or three good catch-lines for the eye
to rest on—then, leave it alone—and there you were!

‘What did you let her bring you for?  Couldn’t you knock her cap off, or
her tooth out, or scratch her, or do something or other to her?’ asked
Bounderby.

‘That’s my opinion, sir,’ said Mrs Gamp, ‘and I will not deceive you. I
believe as Mr Chuffey, sir, rekwires attention (if I may make so bold),
and should not have his liberty to wex and worrit your sweet lady as he
does.’

Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:

‘Well, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘then I wish the artists would come.
This is rather a public place.’

‘Tupman,’ said the old gentleman, ‘you singled out that particular
bird?’

Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the
girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of
the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both
the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which
had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was
trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those
schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were
her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and
deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;
still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some
relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp
he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last—richly as he merited
such a fate—by her hand.

As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address
in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child’s face, and
he sobbed bitterly.

THE PLAUSIBLE COUPLE

They journeyed on when the time came that they must wander forth again,
by pleasant country lanes. The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful
evening, when they came to a caravan drawn up by the road. It was a
smart little house upon wheels, and at the door sat a stout and
comfortable lady, taking tea. The tea-things were set out upon a drum,
covered with a white napkin. And there, as if at the most convenient
table in the world, sat this roving lady, taking her tea and enjoying
the prospect. Of this stout lady Nell ventured to ask how far it was to
the neighboring town. And the lady, noticing that the tired child could
hardly repress a tear at hearing that eight weary miles lay still before
them, not only gave them tea, but offered to take them on in the
caravan.

Another entry was made in the little books, with the gold pencil-cases;
and Mr. Simmery having, by this time, killed all the flies and taken
all the bets, strolled away to the Stock Exchange to see what was going
forward.

‘I don’t see it at all,’ blustered Wegg. ‘You’ll have as much as I
shall. And who are you?’

“Turn!” cried the old woman, “but why not hers as soon as my gal’s! The
mother must have changed—she looked as old as me, and full as wrinkled
through her paint—but she was handsome. What have I done, I, what have
I done worse than her, that only my gal is to lie there fading!”

“Ah! a little touched in the top-hamper.”

He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs.
Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless
state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one
hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath.

‘Yes, yes, Fanny. You said so, I know.’

Just as John had reached this point of painful interest, the heavy foot
of a man was heard to pass hastily over the bridge, and the next moment
the front-door was violently shaken. The two females instantly pinioned
John by clinging round him with all the tenacity of terror, while at
the same time they were loud in their demands for that protection
which, had they needed it, he was by them effectually disabled from
affording; while Master Tweasle, seizing the rattle, and aiding
its noise with his voice, in no small degree increased the family
distraction; above which, however, was plainly heard some one without,
using his best endeavours to force the entrance. Whoever that some one
was, he appeared wholly unmindful of secrecy; which palpable contempt
of caution, and open disregard of whatever resistance the inhabitants
might be able to make, greatly increased their fear of the villain's
intentions. At each shock the door sustained, shrieks were uttered by
the women, accompanied by a very spirited movement by the boy upon
the rattle; and the interval between these assaults Mrs. Tweasle
employed in murmuring prayers and complaints to Heaven and John for the
protection of her life and property.

‘A one-eyed calender, I think, sir,’ faltered Tom.

“And now,” said Polly, “while we are at dinner, you be good, and tell me
that story I taught you.”

PREFACE TO THE “CHARLES DICKENS” EDITION OF “AMERICAN NOTES”

‘Up with you,’ said the stranger, assisting Mr. Pickwick on to the roof
with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman’s
deportment very materially.

The Boylston boys, as may be readily supposed, have very much the
advantage of the others in point of personal appearance.  They were in
their school-room when I came upon them, and answered correctly, without
book, such questions as where was England; how far was it; what was its
population; its capital city; its form of government; and so forth.  They
sang a song too, about a farmer sowing his seed: with corresponding
action at such parts as ‘’tis thus he sows,’ ‘he turns him round,’ ‘he
claps his hands;’ which gave it greater interest for them, and accustomed
them to act together, in an orderly manner.  They appeared exceedingly
well-taught, and not better taught than fed; for a more chubby-looking
full-waistcoated set of boys, I never saw.

“What!” said the master at length, in a faint voice.

No man ever admits the unhealthiness of the place he dwells in (unless he
is going away from it), and I shall therefore, I have no doubt, be at
issue with the inhabitants of St. Louis, in questioning the perfect
salubrity of its climate, and in hinting that I think it must rather
dispose to fever, in the summer and autumnal seasons.  Just adding, that
it is very hot, lies among great rivers, and has vast tracts of undrained
swampy land around it, I leave the reader to form his own opinion.

I possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from my
quarterly allowance during several years. I had always thought that
some accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, without any
relation or any property, on the world and had always tried to keep
some little money by me that I might not be quite penniless. I told
Richard of my having this little store and having no present need of
it, and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole, while I should
be gone to fetch it, that we would have the pleasure of paying his
debt.

Mr. Pickwick changed colour.

‘I always will say,’ he resumed, ‘that when a rich relation having two
young people--sisters or brothers, or brother and sister--dependent on
him, attaches himself exclusively to one, and casts off the other, he
does wrong.’

"More than once?" repeated the notary, with great scorn.  "You don't know
my good friend, Tick-Tick!  He will open the door as often as I ask him.
All he wants is his directions, and he gets them here.  Look below the
dial.  Here is a half-circle of steel let into the wall, and here is a
hand (called the regulator) that travels round it, just as _my_ hand
chooses.  Notice, if you please, that there are figures to guide me on
the half-circle of steel.  Figure I. means: Open once in the four-and-
twenty hours.  Figure II. means: Open twice; and so on to the end.  I set
the regulator every morning, after I have read my letters, and when I
know what my day's work is to be.  Would you like to see me set it now?
What is to-day?  Wednesday.  Good!  This is the day of our rifle-club;
there is little business to do; I grant a half-holiday.  No work here to-
day, after three o'clock.  Let us first put away this portfolio of
municipal papers.  There!  No need to trouble Tick-Tick to open the door
until eight to-morrow.  Good!  I leave the dial-hand at eight; I put back
the regulator to I.; I close the door; and closed the door remains, past
all opening by anybody, till to-morrow morning at eight."

"Do you purpose to take _my_ word for it when I inform you that I have
doubled my income?" asked Vendale.  "If my memory does not deceive me,
you stipulated, a minute since, for plain proofs?"

“You _don’t_ know the sort of nose, Rosa,” with some warmth; “because
it’s nothing of the kind.”

We will frankly own that we have been much troubled with the harlequin.
We see harlequins of so many kinds in the real living pantomime, that we
hardly know which to select as the proper fellow of him of the theatres.
At one time we were disposed to think that the harlequin was neither
more nor less than a young man of family and independent property, who
had run away with an opera-dancer, and was fooling his life and his
means away in light and trivial amusements. On reflection, however,
we remembered that harlequins are occasionally guilty of witty, and
even clever acts, and we are rather disposed to acquit our young men
of family and independent property, generally speaking, of any such
misdemeanours. On a more mature consideration of the subject, we have
arrived at the conclusion, that the harlequins of life are just ordinary
men, to be found in no particular walk or degree, on whom a certain
station, or particular conjunction of circumstances, confers the magic
wand; and this brings us to a few words on the pantomime of public and
political life, which we shall say at once, and then conclude; merely
premising in this place, that we decline any reference whatever to the
columbine: being in no wise satisfied of the nature of her connexion
with her parti-coloured lover, and not feeling by any means clear
that we should be justified in introducing her to the virtuous and
respectable ladies who peruse our lucubrations.

"Oh!  You are the young lady, are you?" said the man, surveying the
small figure and uplifted face.

‘I don’t see what you have to do with her, for all that,’ said the boy.

(_Which we received from a Correspondent, and could not
               possibly insert in a more appropriate place than this._)

Ever affectionately yours.

‘I did not,’ said Nicholas, firmly. ‘Although I found that the necessity
for self-command and restraint became every day more imperious, and the
difficulty greater, I never, for one instant, spoke or looked but as I
would have done had you been by. I never, for one moment, deserted my
trust, nor have I to this instant. But I find that constant association
and companionship with this sweet girl is fatal to my peace of mind, and
may prove destructive to the resolutions I made in the beginning, and up
to this time have faithfully kept. In short, sir, I cannot trust myself,
and I implore and beseech you to remove this young lady from under the
charge of my mother and sister without delay. I know that to anyone but
myself--to you, who consider the immeasurable distance between me and
this young lady, who is now your ward, and the object of your peculiar
care--my loving her, even in thought, must appear the height of rashness
and presumption. I know it is so. But who can see her as I have seen,
who can know what her life has been, and not love her? I have no excuse
but that; and as I cannot fly from this temptation, and cannot repress
this passion, with its object constantly before me, what can I do but
pray and beseech you to remove it, and to leave me to forget her?’

The past night, the day before, and many other days and nights beside,
all mingled themselves up in one unintelligible and senseless whirl; he
could not separate the transactions of one time from those of another.
Now, the noise of the wheels resolved itself into some wild tune in
which he could recognise scraps of airs he knew; now, there was nothing
in his ears but a stunning and bewildering sound, like rushing water.
But his companion rallied him on being so silent, and they talked and
laughed boisterously. When they stopped, he was a little surprised to
find himself in the act of smoking; but, on reflection, he remembered
when and where he had taken the cigar.

NEAR to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe
abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels
on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of
close-built low-roofed houses, there exists, at the present day, the
filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities
that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great
mass of its inhabitants.

“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.

Nicholas laughed, and entering no further into the subject of this
lengthened harangue, reverted to the pleasant tone of the little
birthday party. And as Mrs. Nickleby instantly became very curious
respecting it, and made a great number of inquiries touching what they
had had for dinner, and how it was put on table, and whether it was
overdone or underdone, and who was there, and what ‘the Mr. Cherrybles’
said, and what Nicholas said, and what the Mr. Cherrybles said when he
said that; Nicholas described the festivities at full length, and also
the occurrences of the morning.

“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with a
majestic glance at that innocent little offender. “I hope I know my
poor grandpapa’s position. Jane, indeed!”

Oh, what a busy day was that which followed! I entered Skelton's (the
tailor's) shop with the journeymen. I ordered three complete suits!

"Don't you be afraid of that," returned the woman. "I an't so fond of
his company that I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah!
You may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't
find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a
fine one too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me."

They will please to believe, by way of an easy beginning, all the stories
of good and evil demons, ghosts, prophecies, communication with spirits,
and practice of magic, that ever obtained, or are said to have ever
obtained, in the North, in the South, in the East, in the West, from the
earliest and darkest ages, as to which we have any hazy intelligence,
real or supposititious, down to the yet unfinished displacement of the
red men in North America.  They will please to believe that nothing in
this wise was changed by the fulfilment of our Saviour’s mission upon
earth; and further, that what Saint Paul did, can be done again, and has
been done again.  As this is not much to begin with, they will throw in
at this point rejection of Faraday and Brewster, and “poor Paley”, and
implicit acceptance of those shining lights, the Reverend Charles
Beecher, and the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher (“one of the most vigorous
and eloquent preachers of America”), and the Reverend Adin Ballou.

"Señorita," said I, eager to take advantage of the favourable
impression the vision of the fowl had made on my beloved; "this bird
is a proof of the warm interest which I take in your welfare. I have
heard that you were suffering from the severe affliction that has
fallen on this city; and, though I risk my character and the safety of
his Britannic Majesty's fleet by bringing into Oporto any part of the
provision allotted for the crews, I could not resist the impulse of
stealing this bird, which I now have the honour to lay at your feet."

Mr. Jobling said “Certainly” and withdrew a little from the elbow of
Mr Guppy’s mother.

Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both
of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:

(_Scrooge crosses stage, as if following Spirit to tormentor entrance,
and remains while the scene changes._)

“Yes, yes,” replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. “I’m coming.”

‘They are only clothes,’ returned the guest, ‘such as we wear; hanging
on those lines to dry, and fluttering in the wind.’

_Barnaby Rudge._

Morning rather misty; St. Paul's striking
            eleven, as the curtain rises to hurried music,
            and discovers a haberdasher's shop with plate-glass
            windows. _Snags_, _Mags_, and _Poppleton_ with sundry
            assistants, their hair in papers; but evidently
            preparing for business. Enter _Jeremiah Scout_ with
            a watering-pot; he sprinkles the floor, while the
            apprentices are arranging their neckcloths. _Snags_
            coughs, evincing a recent recovery from influenza. He
            comes forward, and sings.

“I have said, my child, that what I do, I do for your sake, not my
own. It is done. What I am towards you, Rosa, is what I am now—not
what I shall be a little while hence. Remember this, and keep my
confidence. Do so much for my sake, and thus all ends between us!”

Mr. Pickwick took up his hat, and repaired to the Peacock, but Mr.
Winkle had conveyed the intelligence of the fancy-ball there, before
him.

"Adieu!  At four."

She only shook her head; through her tears I saw the same sad quiet
smile.

This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops,
and such shops as Mr. Dolloby's, in preference to the regular dealers.
At last I found one that I thought looked promising, at the corner of a
dirty lane, ending in an inclosure full of stinging nettles, against the
palings of which some second-hand sailors' clothes, that seemed to have
overflowed the shop, were fluttering among some cots, and rusty guns,
and oilskin hats, and certain trays full of so many old rusty keys of so
many sizes that they seemed various enough to open all the doors in the
world.

‘I say it’s very hard I should be made so now,’ returned my mother,
pouting; ‘and it is--very hard--isn’t it?’

A filthy channel of mud and refuse meanders down the centre of the
miserable streets, fed by obscene rivulets that trickle from the abject
houses.  There is not a door, a window, or a shutter; not a roof, a wall,
a post, or a pillar, in all Fondi, but is decayed, and crazy, and rotting
away.  The wretched history of the town, with all its sieges and pillages
by Barbarossa and the rest, might have been acted last year.  How the
gaunt dogs that sneak about the miserable streets, come to be alive, and
undevoured by the people, is one of the enigmas of the world.

This spot proved to the Cannon family a second baptismal fount, for,
as they passed by, they all received cognominations according to their
external appearance, which ever after have stuck to them. Commodus
Cannon, a short, plump, dapper man, was called the Mortar; Mrs. Cannon,
also of respectable _embonpoint_, and of a _tournure_ between an apple
dumpling and a raspberry bolster-pudding, was named the Howitzer; Miss
Molly, a tall slight figure, was favoured with the appellation of the
Culverin; Biddy, a squat cherub-looking girl, was basely named the
Pateraro; Lucy, who had rather a cast in each eye, which had induced
the wits of Muckford to christen her Miss Wednesday (as they pretended
that she looked both ways to Sunday,)--Miss Lucy, those pernicious
sponsors called the Swivel; Kitty, a stout, short, beautiful creature,
in whose form graceful undulations made up for length, they nicknamed
the Carronade. The senior of the junior Cannons was a Short Nine;
George, a Four Pounder; Cornelius, a Cohorn; Peter, a Long Six; and
Oliver, a Pétard, the most horrible and degrading patronymic that could
be bestowed upon any poor traveller in France.

‘You’re first of the lot, Mas’r Davy!’ said Mr. Peggotty with a happy
face. ‘Doen’t keep in that coat, sir, if it’s wet.’

‘Yes,’ said Nicholas, ‘Mr. Lillyvick is there.’

‘Stay!’ cried Mr Tigg, who had watched this proceeding keenly. ‘I was
just about to say, that for the convenience of posting you had better
make it gold. Thank you. A general direction, I suppose, to Mr Pinch at
Mr Pecksniff’s--will that find you?’

The nurse don’t remember what old man is referred to.  There has been
such a many old men.  The well-spoken old man is doubtful.  The spectral
old man who has come to life in bed, says, ‘Billy Stevens.’  Another old
man who has previously had his head in the fireplace, pipes out,

The Captain, who had become cautious of reading the news, lest he
should find himself advertised at full length by Mrs MacStinger, shook
his head.

CHAPTER 46

‘Suppose that lad,’ pursued Fagin, ‘was to peach--to blow upon us
all--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then
having a meeting with ‘em in the street to paint our likenesses,
describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where
we might be most easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and
besides to blow upon a plant we’ve all been in, more or less--of his
own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and
brought to it on bread and water,--but of his own fancy; to please
his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested
against us, and peaching to them. Do you hear me?’ cried the Jew,
his eyes flashing with rage. ‘Suppose he did all this, what then?’

Poor Clemency, with her apron to her eyes, came slowly in, escorted by
her husband; the latter doleful with the presentiment, that if she
abandoned herself to grief, the Nutmeg-Grater was done for.

‘How could you, Tom, how could you suffer me to thank you so fervently
and sincerely for your friendship; and not tell me, like a man, that you
had deserted me! Was it true, Tom! Was it honest! Was it worthy of what
you used to be--of what I am sure you used to be--to tempt me, when you
had turned against me, into pouring out my heart! Oh, Tom!’

I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner
party.

‘When Gabriel Grub had had time to fetch his breath, which the rapidity
of his descent had for the moment taken away, he found himself in what
appeared to be a large cavern, surrounded on all sides by crowds of
goblins, ugly and grim; in the centre of the room, on an elevated seat,
was stationed his friend of the churchyard; and close behind him stood
Gabriel Grub himself, without power of motion.

He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up
the hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across
the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into
the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.

"My dear, good aunt!"

But, when we halted for the night, I found that Miss Maryon had spoken to
Captain Carton concerning me.  For, the Captain came straight up to me,
and says he, "My brave fellow, you have been Miss Maryon's body-guard all
along, and you shall remain so.  Nobody shall supersede you in the
distinction and pleasure of protecting that young lady."  I thanked his
honour in the fittest words I could find, and that night I was placed on
my old post of watching the place where she slept.  More than once in the
night, I saw Captain Carton come out into the air, and stroll about
there, to see that all was well.  I have now this other singular
confession to make, that I saw him with a heavy heart.  Yes; I saw him
with a heavy, heavy heart.

‘Well, so I did,’ was the reply.

"You imagine you'll get your costs, don't you, gentlemen?" said Mr.
Pickwick.

What books are these? You’ve been a stealing ‘em, have you? Give ‘em
here.’ With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp,
and struck him on the head.

"Ha ha ha!" laughed the Doctor thoughtfully, with his hands in his
pockets. "The great farce in a hundred acts!"

Thus aroused, the men prepared to give chase. The evidence was,
indeed, though circumstantial, so convincing, that but little argument
was needed to show the shepherd's guests that after what they had seen
it would look very much like connivance if they did not instantly
pursue the unhappy third stranger, who could not as yet have gone more
than a few hundred yards over such uneven country.

‘A malignant,’ returned the secretary, folding up his papers. ‘Unworthy
such a wife. He remains in outer darkness and steadily refuses.’

After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, the Jew beat down the
amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
and sixpence, protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would
only leave him eighteenpence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly
remarking that if he couldn’t get any more he must be content with
that, Nancy prepared to accompany him home; while the Dodger and Master
Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then, taking leave of
his affectionate friend, returned homewards, attended by Nancy and the
boys, Mr. Sikes meanwhile flinging himself on the bed, and composing
himself to sleep away the time until the young lady’s return.

“And who,” said Barbox Brothers, quite as much embarrassed by his part in
the dialogue as the child could possibly be by his, “is Phœbe?”

The servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me, and
so, as you see, mine was a pleasant life. There could not be a happier
dog than I was, nor a gratefuller one. I will say this for myself, for
it is only the truth: I tried in all ways to do well and right, and
honor my mother's memory and her teachings, and earn the happiness
that had come to me, as best I could.

Our eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as he
gave me his hand.

Genius; or, the Dog's-meat Dog, a sonnet, 214.

Had Mr Nadgett appointed the man who never came, to meet him upon London
Bridge that morning? He was certainly looking over the parapet, and
down upon the steamboat-wharf at that moment. It could not have been
for pleasure; he never took pleasure. No. He must have had some business
there.

Although the General Theatrical Fund Association, unlike many other
public societies and endowments, is represented by no building, whether
of stone, or brick, or glass, like that astonishing evidence of the skill
and energy of my friend Mr. Paxton, which all the world is now called
upon to admire, and the great merit of which, as you learn from the best
authorities, is, that it ought to have fallen down long before it was
built, and yet that it would by no means consent to doing so—although, I
say, this Association possesses no architectural home, it is nevertheless
as plain a fact, rests on as solid a foundation, and carries as erect a
front, as any building, in the world.  And the best and the utmost that
its exponent and its advocate can do, standing here, is to point it out
to those who gather round it, and to say, “judge for yourselves.”

In what I am going to relate, I have no intention of setting up,
opposing, or supporting, any theory whatever.  I know the history of the
Bookseller of Berlin, I have studied the case of the wife of a late
Astronomer Royal as related by Sir David Brewster, and I have followed
the minutest details of a much more remarkable case of Spectral Illusion
occurring within my private circle of friends.  It may be necessary to
state as to this last, that the sufferer (a lady) was in no degree,
however distant, related to me.  A mistaken assumption on that head might
suggest an explanation of a part of my own case,—but only a part,—which
would be wholly without foundation.  It cannot be referred to my
inheritance of any developed peculiarity, nor had I ever before any at
all similar experience, nor have I ever had any at all similar experience
since.

I am most sincerely and affectionately grateful to you, and am full of
pleasure and delight.

This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;
especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that
the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a
comfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly
and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his
friend’s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and
protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, this society administers its benefits
sometimes by way of loan; sometimes by way of gift; sometimes by way of
assurance at very low premiums; sometimes to members, oftener to
non-members; always expressly, remember, through the hands of a secretary
or committee well acquainted with the wants of the applicants, and
thoroughly versed, if not by hard experience at least by sympathy, in the
calamities and uncertainties incidental to the general calling.  One must
know something of the general calling to know what those afflictions are.
A lady who had been upon the stage from her earliest childhood till she
was a blooming woman, and who came from a long line of provincial actors
and actresses, once said to me when she was happily married; when she was
rich, beloved, courted; when she was mistress of a fine house—once said
to me at the head of her own table, surrounded by distinguished guests of
every degree, “Oh, but I have never forgotten the hard time when I was on
the stage, and when my baby brother died, and when my poor mother and I
brought the little baby from Ireland to England, and acted three nights
in England, as we had acted three nights in Ireland, with the pretty
creature lying upon the only bed in our lodging before we got the money
to pay for its funeral.”

He had been crouching on the step for some time, gazing listlessly at
the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed
that they could do with ease in a few hours what it had taken him a
whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish,
when he was roused by observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly
some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most
earnestly from the opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this
at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation
so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon
this, the boy crossed over, and, walking close up to Oliver, said,

“What now?” said Lady Dedlock. “Two!”

"What money have you got, Copperfield?" he said, walking aside with me
when he had disposed of my affair in these terms.

The little barber hastened to explain that she was neither a young
woman, nor a handsome woman, but a nurse, who had been acting as a kind
of house-keeper to a gentleman for some weeks past, and left her place
that night, in consequence of being superseded by another and a more
legitimate house-keeper--to wit, the gentleman’s bride.

I replied that such was the fact.

Mr. Pickwick looked round him. The attachment and fervour of his
followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him. He was their
leader, and he felt it.

The infection of the Station was this:—When it was in its raving state,
the Apprentices found it impossible to be there, without labouring under
the delusion that they were in a hurry.  To Mr. Goodchild, whose ideas of
idleness were so imperfect, this was no unpleasant hallucination, and
accordingly that gentleman went through great exertions in yielding to
it, and running up and down the platform, jostling everybody, under the
impression that he had a highly important mission somewhere, and had not
a moment to lose.  But, to Thomas Idle, this contagion was so very
unacceptable an incident of the situation, that he struck on the fourth
day, and requested to be moved.

‘Good night. And a pleasant ride!’

“Will you let me kiss you?”

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Thursday, May 24th, 1855._

‘There was no city where Bath stands, then. There was no vestige of
human habitation, or sign of man’s resort, to bear the name; but there
was the same noble country, the same broad expanse of hill and dale, the
same beautiful channel stealing on, far away, the same lofty mountains
which, like the troubles of life, viewed at a distance, and partially
obscured by the bright mist of its morning, lose their ruggedness and
asperity, and seem all ease and softness. Moved by the gentle beauty of
the scene, the prince sank upon the green turf, and bathed his swollen
feet in his tears.

‘I am sure if there’s anything we can do,--Varden, or I, or Dolly
either,--to serve you, sir, at any time, you have only to say it, and it
shall be done,’ said Mrs V.

‘Talking of business,’ interposed Mr. Barton, from the centre of the
table. ‘A gentleman whom you knew very well, Malderton, before you made
that first lucky spec of yours, called at our shop the other day, and—’

Gabriel returned no answer, but looked on in silence while Peak (who had
entered with the hot chocolate) ran to a drawer, and returning with
a bottle, sprinkled his master’s dressing-gown and the bedding; and
besides moistening the locksmith himself, plentifully, described a
circle round about him on the carpet. When he had done this, he again
retired; and Sir John, reclining in an easy attitude upon his pillow,
once more turned a smiling face towards his visitor.

At last the time came when the old man's feeble frame could bear up no
longer against his hidden care. A raging fever seized him, and, as he
lay delirious or insensible through many weeks, Nell learned that the
house which sheltered them was theirs no longer; that in the future they
would be very poor; that they would scarcely have bread to eat. At
length the old man began to mend, but his mind was weakened.

The hysterics called up Peggotty. The moment my aunt was restored, she
flew at Peggotty, and calling her a silly old creature, hugged her with
all her might. After that, she hugged Mr. Dick (who was highly honored,
but a good deal surprised); and after that, told them why. Then, we were
all happy together.

‘By the Lord, he’s done me!’

‘Are there any witnesses?’ inquired Mr. Fang.

the lines immediately conjured up the image of poor Charles in the midst
of his dumps and spectres at the end of his own long gallery.

‘Very true,’ said Nicholas. ‘I beg your pardon. Then I don’t know what
it is, I am sure.’

'He, too, will have a companion,' resumed Mr. Pickwick, 'a lively
    one, who'll teach him, I'll be bound, more tricks in a week than he
    would ever learn in a year.'  And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly.

"Missus"--roared the man with the red head, emerging from the garden,
and looking very hard at the horse--"Missus!"

“She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would
only add to her trouble. Don’t speak of me to her. As I said to you when
I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.
You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.”

After dinner I had to tell my story all over again to my aunt and Mr.
Dick. Miss Trotwood again asked Mr. Dick's advice, and was delighted
when that gentleman suggested I should be put to bed. I knelt down to
say my prayers that night in a pleasant room facing the sea, and as I
lay in the clean, snow-white bed, I felt so grateful and comforted that
I prayed earnestly I might never be homeless again, and might never
forget the homeless.

Hours are golden links, God's token,
Reaching Heaven; but one by one
Take them, lest the chain be broken
Ere the pilgrimage be done.

‘Waiting?’ says Eugene over his shoulder, in confidence, with the
Analytical.

"The two houses adjoining!" I exclaimed. "You must have had a great
deal of trouble."

"So I have always heard," replied Grimaldi: "but so it is; I have not
heard a syllable."

VERSE: A DEAD PAST

‘Come!  How should I know who kept the house?  When I sent my servant on
to you, I strolled in here because the place was new to me; and I had a
natural curiosity in everything new and old, in these old scenes; and it
was outside the town.  I wanted to communicate with you, first, before
appearing there.  I wanted to know what people would say to me.  I see by
your manner that you can tell me.  If it were not for your confounded
caution, I should have been possessed of everything long ago.’

She asks all her questions as if she were repeating them from memory
or calling them over in her sleep.

CHAPTER VI.
The Shoemaker

I would not by any means consent to this, for it occurred to me that I
really ought to have a little house-warming, and that there never
could be a better opportunity. I had a new pride in my rooms after
his approval of them, and burned with a desire to develop their utmost
resources. I therefore made him promise positively in the names of his
two friends, and we appointed six o’clock as the dinner-hour.

Did she repent?  O Sorrow!
Why do we linger still
To take thy loving message,
And do thy gentle will?
See, her tears fall more slowly;
The passionate murmurs cease,
And back upon her spirit
Flow strength, and love, and peace.

Haste is made a remarkable characteristic of Romeo,--because it is at
once the parent and the child of uniform misfortune. As from the acorn
springs the oak, and from the oak the acorn, so does the temperament
that inclines to haste predispose to misadventure, and a continuance
of misadventure confirms the habit of haste. A man whom his rashness
has made continually unlucky, is strengthened in the determination to
persevere in his rapid movements by the very feeling that the "run"
is against him, and that it is of no use to think. In the case of
Romeo, he leaves it all to the steerage of Heaven, _i. e._ to the heady
current of his own passions; and he succeeds accordingly. All through
the play care is taken to show his impatience. The very first word he
speaks indicates that he is anxious for the quick passage of time.

Nothing had ever appeared so beautiful in his sight. He took them up and
inhaled their fragrance, and he lifted them to his hot head, and he put
them down and opened his parched hands to them, as cold hands are opened
to receive the cheering of a fire. It was not until he had delighted in
them for some time, that he wondered who had sent them; and opened his
door to ask the woman who must have put them there, how they had come
into her hands. But she was gone, and seemed to have been long gone; for
the tea she had left for him on the table was cold. He tried to drink
some, but could not bear the odour of it: so he crept back to his chair
by the open window, and put the flowers on the little round table of
old.

My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—I
had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,—when Mr.
Pumblechook interposed with “No! Don’t lose your temper. Leave this lad
to me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr. Pumblechook then turned me
towards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,—

“Mrs. Frank, is there any reason why we two should not put up our horses
together?”

‘My dear love,’ said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl
to her bosom, ‘do you think I would harm a hair of his head?’

Yielding to a certain sullen doggedness, which it seemed to be a part of
his condition to struggle with, he argued for remaining.

‘Clerks,’ replied Sam.

I am larger than I thought!
     I did not know I held so much goodness!

“Assuredly,” replied Herbert.

SCENE III.--_Fezziwig's Ball, full depth of stage,
      representing a wareroom. Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig
      L., the former standing and clapping his hands, and
      the latter seated in an arm-chair, manifesting
      delight. Old bald-headed fiddler, on an elevated seat,
      at the back. Dick Wilkins, with two Miss Fezziwigs,
      forward to right and back. Scrooge's former self
      advances and retires to the partners, with fancy
      steps: hands around; right and left; ladies change;
      balance; promenade. Other characters to fill up the
      picture. Laughter and merriment to follow Scrooge's
      speech._

"As long as the novelty should last," said I, laughing.

‘Never,’ said Mr. Pickwick, with great energy, ‘never.’

“It has afforded the Author great amusement and satisfaction, during the
progress of this work, to learn, from country friends and from a variety
of ludicrous statements concerning himself in provincial newspapers,
that more than one Yorkshire schoolmaster lays claim to being the
original of Mr. Squeers. One worthy, he has reason to believe, has
actually consulted authorities learned in the law, as to his having good
grounds on which to rest an action for libel; another, has meditated a
journey to London, for the express purpose of committing an assault and
battery on his traducer; a third, perfectly remembers being waited on,
last January twelve-month, by two gentlemen, one of whom held him
in conversation while the other took his likeness; and, although Mr.
Squeers has but one eye, and he has two, and the published sketch does
not resemble him (whoever he may be) in any other respect, still he
and all his friends and neighbours know at once for whom it is meant,
because--the character is SO like him.

Mr Garland and the Notary walked in, looking very grave; and, drawing up
two chairs, one on each side of the single gentleman, formed a kind of
fence round the gentle Sarah, and penned her into a corner.  Her brother
Sampson under such circumstances would certainly have evinced some
confusion or anxiety, but she--all composure--pulled out the tin box,
and calmly took a pinch of snuff.

[Illustration]

We find a let of two hundred stalls here, which is very large for this
place. The evening being fine too, and blue being to be seen in the sky
beyond the smoke, we expect to have a very full hall. Tell Mamey and
Katey that if they had been with us on the railway to-day between
Leamington and this place, they would have seen (though it is only an
hour and ten minutes by the express) fires and smoke indeed. We came
through a part of the Black Country that you know, and it looked at its
blackest. All the furnaces seemed in full blast, and all the coal-pits
to be working.

‘Hush, Dick!’ said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust
his thin arm between the rails to greet him. ‘Is any one up?’

"Where are you?"

"We're going on to the races," said the little man. "If that's your way
and you like to have us for company, let us travel together. If you
prefer going alone, only say the word and you'll find that we sha'n't
trouble you."

‘It is really,’ returned my host, ‘quite a coincidence, that Traddles
should be here at all: as Traddles was only invited this morning, when
the place at table, intended to be occupied by Mrs. Henry Spiker’s
brother, became vacant, in consequence of his indisposition. A very
gentlemanly man, Mrs. Henry Spiker’s brother, Mr. Copperfield.’

“Ned,” said the old man, drawing Walter to his side, and taking his arm
tenderly through his, “I know. I know. Of course I know that Wally
considers me more than himself always. That’s in my mind. When I say he
is glad to go, I mean I hope he is. Eh? look you, Ned and you too,
Wally, my dear, this is new and unexpected to me; and I’m afraid my
being behind the time, and poor, is at the bottom of it. Is it really
good fortune for him, do you tell me, now?” said the old man, looking
anxiously from one to the other. “Really and truly? Is it? I can
reconcile myself to almost anything that advances Wally, but I won’t
have Wally putting himself at any disadvantage for me, or keeping
anything from me. You, Ned Cuttle!” said the old man, fastening on the
Captain, to the manifest confusion of that diplomatist; “are you
dealing plainly by your old friend? Speak out, Ned Cuttle. Is there
anything behind? Ought he to go? How do you know it first, and why?”

"'Well,' said the widow, laughing outright this time. '_When_ I do, I
hope I shall have as good a husband as you describe.'

With the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to
the outside of the iron gate. It holds the gate with its hands and
looks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.

“They had better not!” said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. “Let me see
any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I
can tell him that he wouldn’t do it a second time!”

“I decline to answer, if in my judgment thought has the limit you would
fix to it. But proceed; you have a special question you wish to put.”

‘Ah Mr. Sapsea!’ exclaimed the young man. ‘Disguise from you is
impossible. You know already that I come from somewhere, and am going
somewhere else. If I was to deny it, what would it avail me?’

Boots assures me that when they clapped their hands, and jumped for
joy again, and called him "Good Cobbs!" and "Dear Cobbs!" and bent
across him to kiss one another in the delight of their confiding
hearts, he felt himself the meanest rascal for deceiving 'em that ever
was born.

“That fusion of the graces of the imagination with the realities of life,
which is vital to the welfare of any community, and for which I have
striven from week to week as honestly as I could during the last nine
years, will continue to be striven for “all the year round”.  The old
weekly cares and duties become things of the Past, merely to be assumed,
with an increased love for them and brighter hopes springing out of them,
in the Present and the Future.

I said I should be glad to come.

‘And I beg leave to ask you, Mr Rokesmith,’ said Bella, ‘why you took
that liberty?—I hope there is no offence in the phrase; it is your own,
remember.’

‘Mr. Nickleby,’ said Nicholas in explanation.

“Why should I tell Florence?” she returned, so suddenly and harshly,
that Florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice.

"Misther Dick," said Andy, lowering his voice, "wouldn't it be an
iligant thing to put two balls into the pistle instid o' one, and give
the masther a chance over the 'torney?"

Well. There was not much in well. It was not a long speech. ‘I thought
you gave an order,’ said the landlord, after a pause of two or three
minutes for consideration.

‘And what was the repentance that was extorted from the hardness of her
heart and the blackness of her depravity? I, vindictive and implacable?
It may be so, to such as you who know no righteousness, and no
appointment except Satan’s. Laugh; but I will be known as I know
myself, and as Flintwinch knows me, though it is only to you and this
half-witted woman.’

“Possibly, but indeed I don’t know, although they stood whispering very
near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
they looked at papers.”

These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little
daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her
child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always active
and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not be told.
Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet
in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is
the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
have too much to do?”

‘Well! so I did,’ was the reply.

There were more trucks near Todgers' than you would suppose a whole city
could ever need; not trucks at work but a vagabond race, forever
lounging in the narrow lanes before their masters' doors and stopping up
the pass; so that when a stray hackney-coach or lumbering wagon came
that way, they were the cause of such an uproar as enlivened the whole
neighborhood, and made the very bells in the next church-tower ring
again. In the narrow dark streets near Todgers', wine-merchants and
wholesale dealers in grocery-ware had perfect little towns of their own;
and, deep among the very foundations of these buildings, the ground was
undermined and burrowed out into stables, where cart-horses, troubled by
rats, might be heard on a quiet Sunday, rattling their halters, as
disturbed spirits in tales of haunted houses are said to clank their
chains.

‘You don’t happen to know any good of him, do you?’ said Mr.
Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble’s
features.

“Mine,” replied Monks.

Both father and son salute the trooper heartily. He saying, in due
season, that he has come to advise with Mr. Bagnet, Mr. Bagnet
hospitably declares that he will hear of no business until after
dinner and that his friend shall not partake of his counsel without
first partaking of boiled pork and greens. The trooper yielding to
this invitation, he and Mr. Bagnet, not to embarrass the domestic
preparations, go forth to take a turn up and down the little street,
which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms, as if it
were a rampart.

‘Thank you, sir,’ said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply,
the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious
instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great
attention to.

I knew well--better perhaps than he thought, as far as my poor mother
was concerned--and I obeyed him to the letter. I retreated to my own
room no more; I took refuge with Peggotty no more; but sat wearily in
the parlour day after day, looking forward to night, and bedtime.

"No. It's because you are like no one else. You are so good, and so
sweet-tempered. You have such a gentle nature, and you are always
right."

Miss La Creevy had got up early to put a fancy nose into a miniature of
an ugly little boy, destined for his grandmother in the country, who was
expected to bequeath him property if he was like the family.

“Exactly,” said Cousin Feenix, bending forward to see the mild man, and
smile encouragement at him down the table. “That was Jack. Joe wore—”

"Pretty well, thankee, master; I was just going to call up at your
place."

The bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth. How
England can get on through four long summer months without its
bar—which is its acknowledged refuge in adversity and its only
legitimate triumph in prosperity—is beside the question; assuredly
that shield and buckler of Britannia are not in present wear. The
learned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the
unprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his client by the
opposite party that he never seems likely to recover it is doing
infinitely better than might be expected in Switzerland. The learned
gentleman who does the withering business and who blights all
opponents with his gloomy sarcasm is as merry as a grig at a French
watering-place. The learned gentleman who weeps by the pint on the
smallest provocation has not shed a tear these six weeks. The very
learned gentleman who has cooled the natural heat of his gingery
complexion in pools and fountains of law until he has become great in
knotty arguments for term-time, when he poses the drowsy bench with
legal “chaff,” inexplicable to the uninitiated and to most of the
initiated too, is roaming, with a characteristic delight in aridity
and dust, about Constantinople. Other dispersed fragments of the same
great palladium are to be found on the canals of Venice, at the
second cataract of the Nile, in the baths of Germany, and sprinkled
on the sea-sand all over the English coast. Scarcely one is to be
encountered in the deserted region of Chancery Lane. If such a lonely
member of the bar do flit across the waste, and come upon a prowling
suitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of his anxiety,
they frighten one another and retreat into opposite shades.

His friend nodded again, with a cunning look which seemed to hint that
Mr Brass held stronger opinions on the subject than his sister; and
seeming to recollect herself, added imploringly, ‘But don’t you ever
tell upon me, or I shall be beat to death.’

It has just occurred to our reflective mind, that the imaginative
people before-mentioned must have been figurative also; and meant by
earth, human clay,--and by the fire therein, love. We should like to
know what love will _not_ do; and, until we are told, we shall deem it
capable, as the ancients did fire, of producing everything.

‘Mr Wrayburn,’ proceeded the boy, ‘we not only know this that I have
charged upon you, but we know more. It has not yet come to my sister’s
knowledge that we have found it out, but we have. We had a plan, Mr
Headstone and I, for my sister’s education, and for its being advised
and overlooked by Mr Headstone, who is a much more competent authority,
whatever you may pretend to think, as you smoke, than you could produce,
if you tried. Then, what do we find? What do we find, Mr Lightwood? Why,
we find that my sister is already being taught, without our knowing
it. We find that while my sister gives an unwilling and cold ear to our
schemes for her advantage—I, her brother, and Mr Headstone, the most
competent authority, as his certificates would easily prove, that could
be produced—she is wilfully and willingly profiting by other schemes.
Ay, and taking pains, too, for I know what such pains are. And so does
Mr Headstone! Well! Somebody pays for this, is a thought that naturally
occurs to us; who pays? We apply ourselves to find out, Mr Lightwood,
and we find that your friend, this Mr Eugene Wrayburn, here, pays. Then
I ask him what right has he to do it, and what does he mean by it, and
how comes he to be taking such a liberty without my consent, when I
am raising myself in the scale of society by my own exertions and Mr
Headstone’s aid, and have no right to have any darkness cast upon my
prospects, or any imputation upon my respectability, through my sister?’

"Faith, I wouldn't doubt you, sir: but, sure, how could I help that
divil of a mare runnin' away wid me, and thramplin' the dogs?"

Indeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable
scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers;
and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up;
bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear
of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage
kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which,
following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl,
shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest
purpose lay working at his heart.

On the opening of Covent Garden Theatre in October,[38] he became first
acquainted with Mr. Farley, between whom and himself a very warm and
sincere friendship ever after existed. This gentleman inquired in what
character he would wish, to make his first appearance. He mentioned
Scaramouch in "Don Juan," which had been one of his most successful
parts at the other house; but Mr. Farley suggested Orson, in "Valentine
and Orson," urging that the drama, which had not been acted for several
years, had been very popular with the town, and that Orson was a
character well suited to his abilities, in which it was very probable
he would make a great hit. Grimaldi at once consented to play the part,
merely requesting that Mr. Farley would be good enough to give him some
instruction in it, as he had never seen any portion of the piece, and
was at some loss how to study the character. Mr. Farley readily agreed
to do so, and faithfully kept his word.

This market of Covent Garden was quite out of the creature’s line of
road, but it had the attraction for him which it has for the worst of
the solitary members of the drunken tribe. It may be the companionship
of the nightly stir, or it may be the companionship of the gin and
beer that slop about among carters and hucksters, or it may be the
companionship of the trodden vegetable refuse which is so like their own
dress that perhaps they take the Market for a great wardrobe; but be
it what it may, you shall see no such individual drunkards on doorsteps
anywhere, as there. Of dozing women-drunkards especially, you shall come
upon such specimens there, in the morning sunlight, as you might
seek out of doors in vain through London. Such stale vapid rejected
cabbage-leaf and cabbage-stalk dress, such damaged-orange countenance,
such squashed pulp of humanity, are open to the day nowhere else. So,
the attraction of the Market drew Mr Dolls to it, and he had out his two
fits of trembles and horrors in a doorway on which a woman had had out
her sodden nap a few hours before.

‘You will find,’ said Mr Haredale, calmly, ‘your trusty go-between in
waiting at the gate by which you entered. I have played no spy’s part,
sir. I chanced to see you pass the gate, and followed. You might have
heard me knocking for admission, had you been less swift of foot,
or lingered in the garden. Please to withdraw. Your presence here is
offensive to me and distressful to my niece.’ As he said these words,
he passed his arm about the waist of the terrified and weeping girl, and
drew her closer to him; and though the habitual severity of his manner
was scarcely changed, there was yet apparent in the action an air of
kindness and sympathy for her distress.

“Yes, sir,” he replied. “Going to London.”

At the crisis of the conspiracy the hopes of the disaffected almost
centred in this individual, who has left a memory behind which commands
the admiration of many--the pity, I believe, of all. His earlier history
we have already sketched, and the more painful duty of describing its
hurried and unhappy close now devolves upon us. Meanwhile Lord Edward,
as a military leader, devoted himself to arming and disciplining the
people whose grievances he was preparing to redress by force.

Nobody executing this order, the old gentleman, after a short pause,
raised his voice again and demanded a thunder sandwich. This article not
being forthcoming either, he requested to be served with a fricassee of
boot-tops and goldfish sauce, and then laughing heartily, gratified his
hearers with a very long, very loud, and most melodious bellow.

‘I wish to get back as quickly as I can, and you walk too near me,
answered Dolly.’

The formal couple are always sticklers for what is rigidly proper, and
have a great readiness in detecting hidden impropriety of speech or
thought, which by less scrupulous people would be wholly unsuspected.
Thus, if they pay a visit to the theatre, they sit all night in a
perfect agony lest anything improper or immoral should proceed from the
stage; and if anything should happen to be said which admits of a
double construction, they never fail to take it up directly, and to
express by their looks the great outrage which their feelings have
sustained. Perhaps this is their chief reason for absenting themselves
almost entirely from places of public amusement. They go sometimes to
the Exhibition of the Royal Academy;—but that is often more shocking
than the stage itself, and the formal lady thinks that it really is
high time Mr. Etty was prosecuted and made a public example of.

‘I tell you I am not rich,’ repeated Mr Boffin, ‘and I won’t have it.’

As he stood there, trying to quench his fiery face with his drink of
water, the comparison between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces
turned towards him, was extremely to his disadvantage.  Judging him by
Nature’s evidence, he was above the mass in very little but the stage on
which he stood.  In many great respects he was essentially below them.
He was not so honest, he was not so manly, he was not so good-humoured;
he substituted cunning for their simplicity, and passion for their safe
solid sense.  An ill-made, high-shouldered man, with lowering brows, and
his features crushed into an habitually sour expression, he contrasted
most unfavourably, even in his mongrel dress, with the great body of his
hearers in their plain working clothes.  Strange as it always is to
consider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the
dreariness of some complacent person, lord or commoner, whom
three-fourths of it could, by no human means, raise out of the slough of
inanity to their own intellectual level, it was particularly strange, and
it was even particularly affecting, to see this crowd of earnest faces,
whose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could
doubt, so agitated by such a leader.

"A quarter past," said Scrooge, counting.

‘Then the authorities out there—’ I began, when Pangloss cut me short
again.

One of our most remarkable Insularities is a tendency to be firmly
persuaded that what is not English is not natural. In the Fine Arts
department of the French Exhibition, recently closed, we repeatedly
heard, even from the more educated and reflective of our countrymen,
that certain pictures which appeared to possess great merit--of which
not the lowest item was, that they possessed the merit of a vigorous
and bold Idea--were all very well, but were “theatrical.” Conceiving
the difference between a dramatic picture and a theatrical picture,
to be, that in the former case a story is strikingly told, without
apparent consciousness of a spectator, and that in the latter case the
groups are obtrusively conscious of a spectator, and are obviously
dressed up, and doing (or not doing) certain things with an eye to the
spectator, and not for the sake of the story; we sought in vain for
this defect. Taking further pains then, to find out what was meant by
the term theatrical, we found that the actions and gestures of the
figures were not English. That is to say,--the figures expressing
themselves in the vivacious manner natural in a greater or less degree
to the whole great continent of Europe, were overcharged and out of
the truth, because they did not express themselves in the manner
of our little Island--which is so very exceptional, that it always
places an Englishman at a disadvantage, out of his own country, until
his fine sterling qualities shine through his external formality and
constraint. Surely nothing can be more unreasonable, say, than that
we should require a Frenchman of the days of Robespierre, to be taken
out of his jail to the guillotine with the calmness of Clapham or
the respectability of Richmond Hill, after a trial at the Central
Criminal Court in eighteen hundred and fifty-six. And yet this exactly
illustrates the requirement of the particular Insularity under
consideration.

Her ladyship and the ward of the FIZ-ZISH-UN send their best loves, in
which I heartily join. If you and your dear husband come to town before
we bring out Bulwer's comedy, I think we must have a snug reading of it.

"'Emma, it is unnecessary now to tell you how I employed myself during
seventeen years, and how much I thought of those days when my beautiful
cousin would gaze fondly in my eyes, and call me 'her dear Randolph!'
Need I say what unexpected delight I experienced when once I was
enabled to save her child, then a very cherub, and still beautiful
as herself, from destruction? You know all this; and how, after this
transaction, blessed with her gratitude, I departed for Ceylon. Was I
not loaded also with the knowledge and the misery that she, my beloved
one, was not happy? I could not stay to witness her regrets.

‘Yes, sir,’ replied the little old gentleman. ‘Well, Sir, what have you
got to say to me?’

I hope you may have met with the little touch of Radicalism I gave them
at Birmingham in the words of Buckle? With pride I observe that it makes
the regular political traders, of all sorts, perfectly mad. Such was my
intentions, as a grateful acknowledgment of having been misrepresented.

Except that the house had an immensely large rambling loft at top, I made
no other discoveries.  It was moderately well furnished, but sparely.
Some of the furniture—say, a third—was as old as the house; the rest was
of various periods within the last half-century.  I was referred to a
corn-chandler in the market-place of the county town to treat for the
house.  I went that day, and I took it for six months.

‘I hope so, dearest Lizzie,’ said Eugene, wistfully, and yet somewhat
whimsically. ‘I hope so. But I can’t summon the vanity to think so. How
can I think so, looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine! I
humbly hope it; but I daren’t believe it. There is a sharp misgiving
in my conscience that if I were to live, I should disappoint your good
opinion and my own—and that I ought to die, my dear!’

Chapter 15

“You did,” said Wemmick. “How dare you? You’re not in a fit state to
come here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.
What do you mean by it?”

The speech of Cousin Feenix is received with great applause, and Mr
Dombey returns thanks on behalf of himself and Mrs Dombey. J. B.
shortly afterwards proposes Mrs Skewton. The breakfast languishes when
that is done, the violated hatchments are avenged, and Edith rises to
assume her travelling dress.

‘And I wish it was in Jonadge’s belly, I do,’ cried Mrs Gamp; appearing
to confound the prophet with the whale in this miraculous aspiration.

“‘What do you think of _that_?’ said the goblin, turning his large face
towards Gabriel Grub.

"Then you shall know her," said Steerforth, "for she is one of the seven
wonders of the world. When Miss Mowcher comes, show her in."

‘Arthur?’ exclaimed Blandois, taking off his hat at arm’s length,
and bringing his heels together from a great stride in making him a
flourishing bow. ‘The son of my lady? I am the all-devoted of the son of
my lady!’

‘But I don’t understand; I don’t see my way,’ Twemlow stammers, as he
falters over the book with his glass at his eye. ‘How warn her father,
and not tell him? Tell him how much? Tell him how little? I—I—am
getting lost.’

"One moment, Mr. Snitchey," said that lady. "It is not in my nature to
rake up the ashes of the departed."

“When was Fagin took then?”

In those early days, the turnkey first began profoundly to consider
a question which cost him so much mental labour, that it remained
undetermined on the day of his death. He decided to will and bequeath
his little property of savings to his godchild, and the point arose how
could it be so ‘tied up’ as that only she should have the benefit of
it? His experience on the lock gave him such an acute perception of the
enormous difficulty of ‘tying up’ money with any approach to tightness,
and contrariwise of the remarkable ease with which it got loose, that
through a series of years he regularly propounded this knotty point to
every new insolvent agent and other professional gentleman who passed in
and out.

“Oh! Ah!” said Mr Chick. “Toor-ru!—such is life, I mean. I hope you are
suited, my dear.”

[Illustration: "_My name is Winkle, sir_"]

‘Certainly,’ said Nicholas. ‘I can easily inquire.’

Into this scene Nanny entered with great spirit. Shaking hands all
round, and introducing Fanny, she hastily threw off her bonnet and
shawl, and bidding Viny unpack the things, she set about dressing in
good earnest.

Having uttered these words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone,
to the immeasurable delight of her hearers, Miss Nancy paused, winked
to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.

The audience would have gone over to Mr Pancks, as one man, woman, and
child, but for the long, grey, silken locks, and the broad-brimmed hat.

‘Not if you are ready, Cinderella, my dear.’

"I remained for some time at a short distance from the great man, who
occasionally addressed a few words to Lord Fitzroy Somerset, Sir E.
Barnes, De Lancey, and others of his principal officers. He was then
awaiting the return of Sir Alexander Gordon, who had gone off by the
Namur road, some time between 6 and 7 o'clock, escorted by a squadron
of the 10th Hussars. I had seen this detachment start at a round trot,
but of course knew not the object of despatching it; which, as we
learned afterwards, was to gain intelligence of Blücher's operations,
whose defeat at Ligny we, that is, the army generally, were ignorant
of, though the Duke was aware of it.

Mrs. Micawber said it must be very little; but we couldn’t allow that,
so it was a glassful.

“To-night’s paper says that Fagin’s taken. Is it true, or a lie?”

“Altogether?  Well.  Altogether, since 1841, I’ve killed seven men and
boys.  It ain’t many in all those years.”

‘Don’t say so,’ retorted Fledgeby, secretly exultant as the old man
stretched out his hands, with a shrinking action of defending himself
against the sharp construction of the two observers. ‘Don’t play the
tune of the trade, Mr Riah. You’ve a right to get in your debts, if
you’re determined to do it, but don’t pretend what every one in your
line regularly pretends. At least, don’t do it to me. Why should you, Mr
Riah? You know I know all about you.’

‘By the Barnacles?’ interrupted Gowan, laughing.

"Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, reproachfully, "I am sorry to find that you
have so little respect for this young man's feelings."

“And here he is,” says the Dean.

‘He is a member of your club, or I am mistaken?’ said the lieutenant
inquiringly.

"Yes, to-night," she replied.  "To-morrow night will be too late.  The
dream will have come again.  Nothing but flight can save us.  Up!"

‘A strange story!’ said the man who had been the cause of the
narration.--‘Stranger still if it comes about as you predict. Is that
all?’

‘What will she do there?’ inquired Ham.

‘No,’ said Merry, almost crying. ‘You had better go away, please!’

‘Asleep! Aye, aye.’ The man appeared surprised by his unexpected
irritability, and saying no more, smoked his pipe in silence. They had
not sat very long, when there was a knocking within.

“In nothing else?”

COMMITTEE'S OFFICE, GALLERY OF ILLUSTRATION,
                           REGENT STREET, _Thursday, July 30th, 1857._

“Is there any path by which I can come down and speak to you?”

‘I am never to leave him, AM I, dear? I could never leave Tom. I am sure
you know that.’

‘I want to speak to you, who spoke to me this morning,’ said Ralph,
pointing out with his finger the man whom he addressed.

She was gone. Nicholas, staggering from the house, thought of the
hurried scene which had just closed upon him, as if it were the phantom
of some wild, unquiet dream. The day wore on; at night, having been
enabled in some measure to collect his thoughts, he issued forth again.

After the first glance, there were slight features in the midst of this
crowd of objects, which sprung out from the mass without any reason, as
it were, and took hold of the attention whether the spectator would or
no. Thus, the revolving chimney-pots on one great stack of buildings
seemed to be turning gravely to each other every now and then, and
whispering the result of their separate observation of what was going on
below. Others, of a crooked-back shape, appeared to be maliciously
holding themselves askew, that they might shut the prospect out and
baffle Todgers'. The man who was mending a pen at an upper window over
the way became of vast importance in the scene, and made a blank in it,
ridiculously large in its size, when he went away. The fluttering of a
piece of cloth upon the dyer's pole had far more interest for the moment
than all the changing motion of the crowd. Yet even while the looker-on
felt angry with himself for this, and wondered how it was the tumult
swelled into a roar; the hosts of objects seemed to thicken and expand a
hundredfold; and after gazing round him, quite scared, he turned into
Todgers' again, much more rapidly than he came out; and ten to one he
told M. Todgers afterwards that if he hadn't done so, he would certainly
have come into the street by the shortest cut: that is to say,
head-foremost.

‘If you seek to recall any particular dashing man to my recollection
by such a trait as that,’ said Ralph, shrugging his shoulders, ‘I shall
confound him with nine-tenths of the dashing men I have ever known.’

"Which is Mr. Tupman?" inquired Mr. Grummer. He had an intuitive
perception of Mr. Pickwick; he knew _him_ at once.

II

All disguise was now useless; the company staggered on deck; the
gentlemen tried to see nothing but the clouds; and the ladies, muffled
up in such shawls and cloaks as they had brought with them, lay about
on the seats, and under the seats, in the most wretched condition.
Never was such a blowing, and raining, and pitching, and tossing,
endured by any pleasure party before. Several remonstrances were sent
down below, on the subject of Master Fleetwood, but they were totally
unheeded in consequence of the indisposition of his natural protectors.
That interesting child screamed at the top of his voice, until he had
no voice left to scream with; and then, Miss Wakefield began, and
screamed for the remainder of the passage.

It is not until they are gone, that Mr. Jasper moves. But then he turns
to Durdles, and bursts into a fit of laughter. Durdles, who still has
that suspended something in his cheek, and who sees nothing to laugh
at, stares at him until Mr. Jasper lays his face down on his arms to
have his laugh out. Then Durdles bolts the something, as if desperately
resigning himself to indigestion.

‘You know where it took place.  Yonder!’

He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and
table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.

‘Let us know all about it first,’ said the surgeon, continuing his
examination with a businesslike delight in it, ‘before we pronounce.’

‘Oh, you cruel, cruel boy, to say I am a disagreeable wife!’ cried Dora.

But in this reckoning they were cruelly mistaken, for in half an hour,
or less, as though the setting in of night had been their preconcerted
signal, the rioters having previously, in small parties, prevented the
lighting of the street lamps, rose like a great sea; and that in so many
places at once, and with such inconceivable fury, that those who had the
direction of the troops knew not, at first, where to turn or what to do.
One after another, new fires blazed up in every quarter of the town,
as though it were the intention of the insurgents to wrap the city in a
circle of flames, which, contracting by degrees, should burn the whole
to ashes; the crowd swarmed and roared in every street; and none but
rioters and soldiers being out of doors, it seemed to the latter as if
all London were arrayed against them, and they stood alone against the
town.

The elder lady by the stove, with the glove stretched on her left hand,
like a glover's sign, half got up, half looked over her broad shoulder,
and wholly plumped down again and rubbed away.

When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.
Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and
shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out,
wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the
two 'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices
died away, and the lads were left to their beds, which were under a
counter in the back shop.

I happened to arrive at the first factory just as the dinner hour was
over, and the girls were returning to their work; indeed the stairs of
the mill were thronged with them as I ascended.  They were all well
dressed, but not to my thinking above their condition; for I like to see
the humbler classes of society careful of their dress and appearance, and
even, if they please, decorated with such little trinkets as come within
the compass of their means.  Supposing it confined within reasonable
limits, I would always encourage this kind of pride, as a worthy element
of self-respect, in any person I employed; and should no more be deterred
from doing so, because some wretched female referred her fall to a love
of dress, than I would allow my construction of the real intent and
meaning of the Sabbath to be influenced by any warning to the
well-disposed, founded on his backslidings on that particular day, which
might emanate from the rather doubtful authority of a murderer in
Newgate.

In October, 1791, when the Revolution was at its height here, sixty
persons: men and women (‘and priests,’ says Goblin, ‘priests’): were
murdered, and hurled, the dying and the dead, into this dreadful pit,
where a quantity of quick-lime was tumbled down upon their bodies.  Those
ghastly tokens of the massacre were soon no more; but while one stone of
the strong building in which the deed was done, remains upon another,
there they will lie in the memories of men, as plain to see as the
splashing of their blood upon the wall is now.

Both the sisters listened keenly.

‘And so, Pa,’ said Bella, moving coaxingly to his side instead of
remaining opposite, ‘you sometimes have a quiet tea here all alone? I
am not in the tea’s way, if I draw my arm over your shoulder like this,
Pa?’

“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of her
intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon
her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would
look true—even to him—and even to her. To return to the man and make an
end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were
bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were
invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter—”

There was a kind of awe about the place, which would have rendered it
difficult to speak in any other manner. Gabriel whispered ‘Yes,’ and
followed him upstairs.

He repaired to her chamber, straight.  Not finding what he had left
there, he returned with distracted looks to the room in which they were
assembled.  From that, he rushed into the schoolmaster’s cottage,
calling her name.  They followed close upon him, and when he had vainly
searched it, brought him home.

It chanced to be a subtle string to sound, in her who had so spoken to
her brother within the hour. It sounded far more forcibly, because of
the change in the speaker for the moment; the passing appearance of
earnestness, complete conviction, injured resentment of suspicion,
generous and unselfish interest. All these qualities, in him usually so
light and careless, she felt to be inseparable from some touch of their
opposites in her own breast. She thought, had she, so far below him
and so different, rejected this disinterestedness, because of some vain
misgiving that he sought her out, or heeded any personal attractions
that he might descry in her? The poor girl, pure of heart and purpose,
could not bear to think it. Sinking before her own eyes, as she
suspected herself of it, she drooped her head as though she had done him
some wicked and grievous injury, and broke into silent tears.

‘Yer don’t know who I am, I suppose, Work’us?’ said the charity-boy,
in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile,
with edifying gravity.

I was there, as I have mentioned, at all hours. When I was there at
night, I generally went home with Charley in a coach; sometimes my
guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood, and we would walk home
together. One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o’clock. I
could not leave, as I usually did, quite punctually at the time, for
I was working for my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to
finish what I was about; but it was within a few minutes of the hour
when I bundled up my little work-basket, gave my darling my last kiss
for the night, and hurried downstairs. Mr. Woodcourt went with me, as
it was dusk.

‘Yes, Ma,’ returned Bella; ‘that is precisely the state of the case.’

As I approached this spot in the evening about half an hour before
sunset, I was surprised to hear the hum of voices, and occasionally a
shout of merriment from the meadow beyond the churchyard; which I found,
when I reached the stile, to be occasioned by a very animated game of
cricket, in which the boys and young men of the place were engaged, while
the females and old people were scattered about: some seated on the grass
watching the progress of the game, and others sauntering about in groups
of two or three, gathering little nosegays of wild roses and hedge
flowers.  I could not but take notice of one old man in particular, with
a bright-eyed grand-daughter by his side, who was giving a sunburnt young
fellow some instructions in the game, which he received with an air of
profound deference, but with an occasional glance at the girl, which
induced me to think that his attention was rather distracted from the old
gentleman’s narration of the fruits of his experience.  When it was his
turn at the wicket, too, there was a glance towards the pair every now
and then, which the old grandfather very complacently considered as an
appeal to his judgment of a particular hit, but which a certain blush in
the girl’s face, and a downcast look of the bright eye, led me to believe
was intended for somebody else than the old man,—and understood by
somebody else, too, or I am much mistaken.

‘Hollo!’ said Sam, picking up his hat, which had been knocked off, and
rubbing his temple. ‘Hollo, sir! if you comes it this vay, you’ll fill
one o’ them bags, and something to spare, at one fire.’

"_I_ know," muttered Mr. Tugby, looking at the till, and round the shop,
and at his wife; and rolling his head with immense intelligence.

The satellite was gone; and Mr Inspector, becoming once again the quiet
Abbot of that Monastery, dipped his pen in his ink and resumed
his books. The two friends who had watched him, more amused by the
professional manner than suspicious of Mr Julius Handford, inquired
before taking their departure too whether he believed there was anything
that really looked bad here?

‘We are going to move into a nice house,’ said Mrs Boffin, who was woman
enough to compromise Mr Boffin on that point, when he couldn’t very well
contest it; ‘and we are going to set up a nice carriage, and we’ll go
everywhere and see everything. And you mustn’t,’ seating Bella beside
her, and patting her hand, ‘you mustn’t feel a dislike to us to begin
with, because we couldn’t help it, you know, my dear.’

‘Upon my soul, if you like,’ said Jonas. ‘What do you say to next week,
now?’

The real name of the little man was Harris, but it had gradually merged
into the less euphonious one of Trotters, which, with the prefatory
adjective, Short, had been conferred upon him by reason of the small
size of his legs.  Short Trotters however, being a compound name,
inconvenient of use in friendly dialogue, the gentleman on whom it had
been bestowed was known among his intimates either as ‘Short,’ or
‘Trotters,’ and was seldom accosted at full length as Short Trotters,
except in formal conversations and on occasions of ceremony.

‘I won’t go so far as to say everything,’ returned Mr Boffin, on whom
his manner seemed to grate, ‘because there’s some things that I never
found among the dust. Well, sir. So Mrs Boffin and me grow older and
older in the old man’s service, living and working pretty hard in it,
till the old man is discovered dead in his bed. Then Mrs Boffin and me
seal up his box, always standing on the table at the side of his bed,
and having frequently heerd tell of the Temple as a spot where lawyer’s
dust is contracted for, I come down here in search of a lawyer to
advise, and I see your young man up at this present elevation, chopping
at the flies on the window-sill with his penknife, and I give him a Hoy!
not then having the pleasure of your acquaintance, and by that
means come to gain the honour. Then you, and the gentleman in the
uncomfortable neck-cloth under the little archway in Saint Paul’s
Churchyard—’

‘I told you before,’ replied Nancy, ‘that I was afraid to speak to
you there. I don’t know why it is,’ said the girl, shuddering, ‘but
I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly
stand.’

‘And yet,’ said Eugene, ‘I should like to see the fellow (Mortimer
excepted) who would undertake to tell me that this was not a real
sentiment on my part, won out of me by her beauty and her worth,
in spite of myself, and that I would not be true to her. I should
particularly like to see the fellow to-night who would tell me so, or
who would tell me anything that could be construed to her disadvantage;
for I am wearily out of sorts with one Wrayburn who cuts a sorry figure,
and I would far rather be out of sorts with somebody else. “Eugene,
Eugene, Eugene, this is a bad business.” Ah! So go the Mortimer
Lightwood bells, and they sound melancholy to-night.’

‘As an exquisite embodiment of the poet’s visions, and a realisation of
human intellectuality, gilding with refulgent light our dreamy moments,
and laying open a new and magic world before the mental eye, the drama
is gone, perfectly gone,’ said Mr. Curdle.

‘Now, Betsy,’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer, with great suavity, and dispersing,
at the same time, the tumultuous little mob of glasses the girl had
collected in the centre of the table--‘now, Betsy, the warm water; be
brisk, there’s a good girl.’

"Certainly," said Mr. Benjamin Allen; "and the cigars were not bad, or
the pork chops either: were they, Bob?"

‘If the real man feels as guilty as I do,’ said Eugene, ‘he is
remarkably uncomfortable.’

The man on the floor, then turning his head round again, said
morosely, “Well! You’ve done, have you?”

‘Happy to see you.’

‘Fashionable Society, my dear?’

Not at all disputing this position, John went out to see that the boy
with the lantern, which had been dancing to and fro before the door and
window, like a Will of the Wisp, took due care of the horse; who was
fatter than you would quite believe, if I gave you his measure, and so
old that his birthday was lost in the mists of antiquity. Boxer, feeling
that his attentions were due to the family in general, and must be
impartially distributed, dashed in and out with bewildering inconstancy;
now describing a circle of short barks round the horse, where he was
being rubbed down at the stable door; now feigning to make savage rushes
at his mistress, and facetiously bringing himself to sudden stops; now
eliciting a shriek from Tilly Slowboy, in the low nursing-chair near the
fire, by the unexpected application of his moist nose to her
countenance; now exhibiting an obtrusive interest in the baby; now going
round and round upon the hearth, and lying down as if he had established
himself for the night; now getting up again, and taking that nothing of
a fag-end of a tail of his out into the weather, as if he had just
remembered an appointment, and was off at a round trot, to keep it.

“Where is it?”

‘If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of
witnesses,’ said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, ‘I am ready to
make one.’

Thus they parted, for that time; but the worst had not come yet.

She always _would_ sit on that little stool.  I think she must have had a
kind of notion that it was a coaxing, wheedling little stool.

Meantime, Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigor, at the
cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity, as related by Mrs. Sowerberry
and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature that Mr. Bumble judged it
prudent to parley before opening the door. With this view he gave a kick
at the outside, by way of prelude; and then, putting his mouth to the
keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:

It was now holiday-time at the schools, and the young ladies had gone
home, and Miss Monflathers was reported to be flourishing in London,
and damaging the hearts of middle-aged gentlemen, but nobody said
anything about Miss Edwards, whether she had gone home, or whether she
had any home to go to, whether she was still at the school, or anything
about her.  But one evening, as Nell was returning from a lonely walk,
she happened to pass the inn where the stage-coaches stopped, just as
one drove up, and there was the beautiful girl she so well remembered,
pressing forward to embrace a young child whom they were helping down
from the roof.

‘They’ve parted.’

"Mysterious!" she cried. "Oh! really? Do you consider me so?"

In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former
seat, Mr. Brownlow returned accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig
received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had
been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver’s behalf,
Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.

Mr. Watkins Tottle flung himself into an arm-chair, and indulged in the
most delicious reveries of future bliss, in which the idea of ‘Five
hundred pounds per annum, with an uncontrolled power of disposing of it
by her last will and testament,’ was somehow or other the foremost. He
had gone through the interview so well, and it had terminated so
admirably, that he almost began to wish he had expressly stipulated for
the settlement of the annual five hundred on himself.

‘You have a free and manly temper, I know,’ said Pinch; ‘and therefore,
your being so ungenerous in this one solitary instance, only grieves
me the more. It’s not my pardon you have to ask, John. You have done ME
nothing but kindnesses.’

"What does this mean?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, looking at Perker with
astonishment. "What has put Sam into this most extraordinary state?"

As they struck the bargain, Mr. Pickwick surveyed him with a painful
interest. He was a tall, gaunt, cadaverous man, in an old greatcoat and
slippers, with sunken cheeks, and a restless, eager eye. His lips were
bloodless, and his bones sharp and thin. God help him! the iron teeth of
confinement and privation had been slowly filing him down for twenty
years.

‘Men are so often mistaken on those points,’ returned Mrs Gowan, shaking
her head, ‘that I candidly confess to you I feel anything but sure of
it, even now; though it is something to have Henry corroborated with so
much gravity and emphasis. He picked the people up at Rome, I think?’

Mr. Pickwick paused, bottled up his vengeance, and corked it down.

‘I hope you don’t think good looks a disqualification for the business,
my lord,’ said Madame Mantalini, simpering.

‘Ah!’ said Mr Brass, breaking the silence, and raising his eyes to the
ceiling with a sigh, ‘Who knows but he may be looking down upon us now!
Who knows but he may be surveying of us from--from somewheres or
another, and contemplating us with a watchful eye!  Oh Lor!’

"I know that well," said I. "But tell me now."

‘His feelings?’ repeated Steerforth disdainfully. ‘His feelings will
soon get the better of it, I’ll be bound. His feelings are not like
yours, Miss Traddles. As to his situation--which was a precious one,
wasn’t it?--do you suppose I am not going to write home, and take care
that he gets some money? Polly?’

CHAPTER III.

[Footnote 5:

‘They are making speeches, and playing at parliament,’ said Mrs.
Alicumpaine to Mrs. Orange.

Mr Pecksniff brought up to the top of the pew, by slow degrees, his
hair, his forehead, his eyebrow, his eye. She was sitting on a bench
beside the door with her hands before her face; and Tom was bending over
her.

‘But you’ll break my heart one of these days,’ added Mrs Varden, with
more resignation, ‘and then we shall both be happy. My only desire is
to see Dolly comfortably settled, and when she is, you may settle ME as
soon as you like.’

3.

‘Not come in search of you, you see; but still seeking some one. He
wants that Blandois man.’

We made a little feast for the children upstairs, and we put Peepy at
the head of the table, and we showed them Caddy in her bridal dress,
and they clapped their hands and hurrahed, and Caddy cried to think
that she was going away from them and hugged them over and over again
until we brought Prince up to fetch her away—when, I am sorry to
say, Peepy bit him. Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop downstairs, in
a state of deportment not to be expressed, benignly blessing Caddy
and giving my guardian to understand that his son’s happiness was his
own parental work and that he sacrificed personal considerations to
ensure it. “My dear sir,” said Mr. Turveydrop, “these young people
will live with me; my house is large enough for their accommodation,
and they shall not want the shelter of my roof. I could have
wished—you will understand the allusion, Mr. Jarndyce, for you
remember my illustrious patron the Prince Regent—I could have
wished that my son had married into a family where there was more
deportment, but the will of heaven be done!”

‘I know what a change papa will feel at first, and I know that at first
I cannot be to him anything like what I have been these many years.
And it is then, Mr Clennam, then more than at any time, that I beg and
entreat you to remember him, and sometimes to keep him company when you
can spare a little while; and to tell him that you know I was fonder
of him when I left him, than I ever was in all my life. For there is
nobody--he told me so himself when he talked to me this very day--there
is nobody he likes so well as you, or trusts so much.’

“Why, I was thinking,” said Barbox Brothers, “—but are you fond of
horses, Polly?”

The looker-on was a round, red-faced, sturdy yeoman, with a double chin,
and a voice husky with good living, good sleeping, good humour, and good
health. He was past the prime of life, but Father Time is not always a
hard parent, and, though he tarries for none of his children, often lays
his hand lightly upon those who have used him well; making them old men
and women inexorably enough, but leaving their hearts and spirits young
and in full vigour. With such people the grey head is but the impression
of the old fellow’s hand in giving them his blessing, and every wrinkle
but a notch in the quiet calendar of a well-spent life.

Mark thanked him for the compliment.

‘No. You would not. I know you would not. You wouldn’t suppose him to be
a public offender; would you?’

‘Why, I really thought she looked as if she would rather have seen
somebody else,’ replied Tottle.

“Here I am,” says Bart.

King Arthur, compassionating the bishop's perturbation, said, "Whenever
in relating your adventure any one doubts it, you shall afford him
sufficient autopsy of its verity by sending, at all seasons of the
year, a butterfly from your hand, in memorial of me and of your
virtuous resolution."

‘That’s a fine fellow,’ said the doctor; ‘you shall come and see
me when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any
communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on
your part to be gone?’

[Illustration]

'Very,' said his three friends.

CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE FINE ARTS.

There, the table was laid for his supper, and his old grey gown was
ready for him on his chair-back at the fire. His daughter put her
little prayer-book in her pocket--had she been praying for pity on all
prisoners and captives!--and rose to welcome him.

‘I don’t grudge it to you,’ returned Jeremiah.

‘Oh, dear,’ said all the ladies, ‘so they are! it’s very natural you
should feel proud of that; but don’t give way, don’t.’

But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a
rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and
plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed
and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who
came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys
and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and
the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!
The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his
pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight
by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,
and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of
wonder and delight with which the development of every
package was received! The terrible announcement that the
baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan
into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having
swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!
The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,
and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.
It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions
got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the
top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.

“Going, Walter!” said Florence. “Where?”

‘Any more reasons to ask for?’ said the fairy.

He then called down a little break-neck range of steps behind a door:
‘Bring up that tea and bread-and-butter!’ which, after some time,
during which I sat looking about me and thinking, and listening to the
stitching in the room and the tune that was being hammered across the
yard, appeared on a tray, and turned out to be for me.

“Come to take you home to-morrow,” replied Benjamin.

‘Very well. Clear the stage,’ cries the manager, hastily packing every
member of the company into the little space there is between the wings
and the wall, and one wing and another. ‘Places, places. Now then,
Witches—Duncan—Malcolm—bleeding officer—where’s the bleeding
officer?’—‘Here!’ replies the officer, who has been rose-pinking for
the character. ‘Get ready, then; now, White, ring the second
music-bell.’ The actors who are to be discovered, are hastily arranged,
and the actors who are not to be discovered place themselves, in their
anxiety to peep at the house, just where the audience can see them. The
bell rings, and the orchestra, in acknowledgment of the call, play
three distinct chords. The bell rings—the tragedy (!) opens—and our
description closes.

Christmas greetings, i. 167

‘Eight o’ clock, Bill,’ said Nancy, when the bell ceased.

The state of the case having been formally explained to Mr. Snodgrass,
and a case of satisfactory pistols, with the satisfactory accompaniments
of powder, ball, and caps, having been hired from a manufacturer in
Rochester, the two friends returned to their inn; Mr. Winkle to ruminate
on the approaching struggle, and Mr. Snodgrass to arrange the weapons of
war, and put them into proper order for immediate use.

He began at times to listen with sullen and horrible pleasure to
the cries of his miserable companions.  He became squalid,
listless, torpid, and disgusting in his appearance.

“—that I was changed. I was surprised to hear you say so, but I
understand, now, that I am. Don’t be angry with me, Walter. I was too
much overjoyed to think of it, then.”

I have received a most flattering message from the head turnkey of the
jail this morning, intimating that "there warn't a genelman in all
London he'd be gladder to show his babies to, than Muster Dickins, and
let him come wenever he would to that shop he wos welcome." But as the
Governor (who is a very nice fellow and a gentleman) is not at home this
morning, and furthermore as the morning itself has rather gone out of
town in respect of its poetical allurements, I think we had best
postpone our visit for a day or two.

Overbury is aware that he has been betrayed and entrapped, and is left
by his treacherous patron to languish in a dungeon. He addresses him
in the bitterest and most indignant language, and threatens him with a
desperate and fatal revenge. He remembers, too, the threat which had
been applied to himself; knows himself to be in the power of the man
who used it; feels himself to be dying by inches, of maladies which the
most rigorous confinement could not have produced; and yet it never
enters his mind that his unscrupulous enemy may have determined, by his
death, to get rid of him and his dangerous secrets!

"I kep it from her arter I heerd on't," said Mr. Peggotty, "going on
nigh a year. We was living then in a solitary place, but among the
beautifullest trees, and with the roses a covering our Beein to the
roof. Theer come along one day, when I was out a working on the land, a
traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England (I doen't rightly
mind which), and of course we took him in, and giv him to eat and drink,
and made him welcome. We all do that, all the colony over. He'd got an
old newspaper with him, and some other account in print of the storm.
That's how she know'd it. When I come home at night, I found she know'd
it."

‘Won’t you stay—and have something?’ said Timson.

"You are punctual, Master Marsh," squeaked the shrill voice of the
Doctor, issuing from the thicket as the first silvery gleam trembled on
the aspens above. "'Tis well; now follow me, and in silence."

He smiled as I looked at these contrivances to while away the time; but
when I looked from them to him, I saw that his lip trembled, and could
have counted the beating of his heart.  I forget how it came about, but
some allusion was made to his having a wife.  He shook his head at the
word, turned aside, and covered his face with his hands.

He dined with me on the next day. His powers of conversation were
certainly much improved since we had last talked together. He could turn
the most superficial reading to admirable account; and so minute was
his observation, and so faithfully and graphically could he describe
manners, and the surface motives of men, that it almost appeared like a
profound knowledge of mankind. Isabella was pleased with his society;
and after she had retired to the drawing-room, my friend expatiated
somewhat at large upon her beauty and elegance, and, above all, upon
the good sense which characterised her. I need hardly say that I also
was delighted with him, and when we shook hands for the night, I could
have hugged the man for his glowing eulogy. I almost loved every one who
admired her. I was too weak--too weak.

I do not think that the best embodiment of chivalry, the realisation of
the handsomest and most romantic figure ever imagined by painter, could
have said this, with a more impressive and affecting dignity than the
plain old Doctor did.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

‘Your only business, my good fellow,’ pursued Sir Joseph, looking
abstractedly at Toby; ‘your only business in life is with me.  You
needn’t trouble yourself to think about anything.  I will think for you;
I know what is good for you; I am your perpetual parent.  Such is the
dispensation of an all-wise Providence!  Now, the design of your creation
is—not that you should swill, and guzzle, and associate your enjoyments,
brutally, with food; Toby thought remorsefully of the tripe; ‘but that
you should feel the Dignity of Labour.  Go forth erect into the cheerful
morning air, and—and stop there.  Live hard and temperately, be
respectful, exercise your self-denial, bring up your family on next to
nothing, pay your rent as regularly as the clock strikes, be punctual in
your dealings (I set you a good example; you will find Mr. Fish, my
confidential secretary, with a cash-box before him at all times); and you
may trust to me to be your Friend and Father.’

"No; nor that neither," said the groom.

‘Cheer up, sir!’ said the apothecary.

"No," said Mr. Creakle. "He knows better. He knows me. Let him keep
away. I say let him keep away," said Mr. Creakle, striking his hand upon
the table, and looking at Mrs. Creakle, "for he knows me. Now you have
begun to know me too, my young friend, and you may go. Take him away."

The day following, Joe saw his mistress, Mr. Wardle's aged mother,
sitting in the arbor. Without saying a word he walked up to her, stood
perfectly still and said nothing.

‘Tom and the Gifted, gentlemen, as you may believe, looked at each other
in a very awkward manner, and with thoughts not at all complimentary to
the two young ladies.  As to the Gifted, I have heard Tom say often, that
he was certain he was in a fit, and had it inwardly.

‘Well, well, my dear,’ said the Jew, ‘I know all that; we--we--have
a mutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.’

‘Mine indeed!’ cried Miggs, with a burst of bitterness--and as she said
it, she glanced towards Dolly. ‘MINE, good gentleman!’

He folded his arms and sat looking at me with an air of the
profoundest astonishment, awaiting what I should say next. I did not
know how to prepare him.

The question of length may be easily adjusted.

‘And was killed?’ interposed Ralph with gleaming eyes. ‘Was he? Is he
dead?’

Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.

‘And he’ll cut you.’

Thou of the sunny hair,
    And brow more sunny and more fair;
    The upraised heaven-blue eye,
    That borrows from the sky
    Its tint, its brightness, and its majesty;
    A lip half pouting and half curl'd,--
    Mercy and Justice met
    To speak thy dictates to the world!
        A form, nor tall,
        Nor small,
    But bearing up the casket of thy mind,
    Like to a classic pillar 'neath an altar set,
    For elegance, and not for gorgeousness design'd.

‘Don’t mention it,’ answered Fledgeby. ‘It’s a failure so far, but I’ll
stay behind, and take another touch at Mr Riah.’

‘But for this faithful man,’ said Martin, turning towards Mark, ‘whom
I first knew in this place, and who went away with me voluntarily, as
a servant, but has been, throughout, my zealous and devoted friend; but
for him, I must have died abroad. Far from home, far from any help or
consolation; far from the probability even of my wretched fate being
ever known to any one who cared to hear it--oh, that you would let me
say, of being known to you!’

As though she felt relieved at having said so much, and had nerved
herself to the remainder of her task, she spoke from this time with a
firmer voice and heightened courage.

“Ponies eating pie in pinafores!” said Polly.  “What a story-teller you
are, ain’t you?”

Mr Venus, with a glance at his friend, replied in the affirmative.

‘If you’ll have the goodness, sir,’ replied Squeers, ‘that’ll be the
very thing. Mr. Nickleby, take three of them boys between you and the
gentleman. Belling and the youngest Snawley can sit between me and the
guard. Three children,’ said Squeers, explaining to the stranger, ‘books
as two.’

Discreetly done, I see no difficulty in this. But it can only be
honourably and hopefully done by having the men together. And I would
not have them at The Falstaff, but in the hall or dining-room--the
servants' hall, an excellent place. Whatever you do, let the men ratify;
and let them feel their little importance, and at once perceive how much
better the business begins to be done.

"We shall never forget it, sir," rejoined Nell; "nor ever forget to be
grateful to you for your kindness to us."

‘Of Mr Casby?’ said Clennam. ‘He’s a fine old fellow.’

‘Go in. You may get to bed now,’ said Wegg, with a grin.

“Did it wave its arm?”

I looked at her earnestly.

The guileless, simple way in which she said it, and in which she put her
hands before her eyes and wept for very happiness, was as touching as it
was delightful.

‘I asked you, simply, if you found all these yourself?’

* *  This song has been set to music
   *   by Mr. Lover, and is published.

"Spirit!" said Scrooge, "show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you
delight to torture me?"

As Mr. Smangle pronounced the last three words, he stopped suddenly,
re-closed the door which he had opened, and, walking softly back to Mr.
Pickwick, stepped close up to him on tip-toe, and said in a very soft
whisper:

Well, one September, as I told you, young Arthur comes to Doncaster,
having decided all of a sudden, in his harebrained way, that he would go
to the races.  He did not reach the town till towards the close of the
evening, and he went at once to see about his dinner and bed at the
principal hotel.  Dinner they were ready enough to give him; but as for a
bed, they laughed when he mentioned it.  In the race-week at Doncaster,
it is no uncommon thing for visitors who have not bespoken apartments, to
pass the night in their carriages at the inn doors.  As for the lower
sort of strangers, I myself have often seen them, at that full time,
sleeping out on the doorsteps for want of a covered place to creep under.
Rich as he was, Arthur’s chance of getting a night’s lodging (seeing that
he had not written beforehand to secure one) was more than doubtful.  He
tried the second hotel, and the third hotel, and two of the inferior inns
after that; and was met everywhere by the same form of answer.  No
accommodation for the night of any sort was left.  All the bright golden
sovereigns in his pocket would not buy him a bed at Doncaster in the
race-week.

‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Snitchey, confidently, ‘and you know it—to beware of
that man—to observe his eye—and now to tell me whether I was right, and
whether at that moment he knew secrets which he didn’t choose to tell.’

_Extract._

The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces.
Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the
rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest
corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man--Fagin.
Before him and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left:
he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with
gleaming eyes.

Meanwhile Kate, left wholly to herself, had, in some degree, recovered
her composure. She had learnt from a female attendant, that her uncle
wished to see her before she left, and had also gleaned the satisfactory
intelligence, that the gentlemen would take coffee at table. The
prospect of seeing them no more, contributed greatly to calm her
agitation, and, taking up a book, she composed herself to read.

‘I think I do,’ said the gentleman, breaking silence. ‘I should by
your description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each
other. It may not be the same.’

Pending the conveyance of this request to some person in authority, we
walked into a grim room, where several grim hats were hanging on grim
pegs, and the time was grimly told by a grim clock which uttered every
tick with a kind of struggle, as if it broke the grim silence
reluctantly, and under protest.  Ranged against the wall were six or
eight stiff, high-backed chairs, and they partook so strongly of the
general grimness that one would much rather have sat on the floor than
incurred the smallest obligation to any of them.

As Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets where the high
church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning
light that the city itself seems renewed by rest, Allan revolves in
his mind how and where he shall bestow his companion. “It surely is a
strange fact,” he considers, “that in the heart of a civilized world
this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of
than an unowned dog.” But it is none the less a fact because of its
strangeness, and the difficulty remains.

Our readers may now form some estimate of the strange weakness and
unreasonableness of the pamphlet, issued by the Factory Association
to refute us. There is not one strong point in it that affects the
question; there is only one that seems strong, and to that the writer
had in her own hands a most conclusive answer. Mr. Fairbairn, in
December 1853, reported against the practicability or safety of fencing
horizontal shafts. The answer to this is repeatedly contained in the
Inspector’s reports for the half-year ending on the thirtieth of April
last, cited at the head of Miss Martineau’s pamphlet. Their joint
report states, “that a considerable amount of horizontal shafting under
seven feet from the floor has been securely cased over in various parts
of the country, and that strap-hooks and other contrivances for the
prevention of accidents from horizontal shafts above seven feet from
the floor, have been and are now being extensively employed in all
our districts, excepting in that of Lancashire, and in places mainly
influenced by that example.” And Mr. Howell is to be found reporting
that in the west of England much new fencing had been done, and that
the experiment had “been tried on a sufficiently large scale, and for
a sufficiently long period to prove the fallacy of the apprehensions
that were expressed, as to the practicability and success of fencing
securely horizontal shafts. It has proved also that the doing so is
unaccompanied by danger.” He gives illustration of this from the
west of England, adding, however, that “in many instances, and more
especially in the cotton factories in that part of my district which is
situate in Cheshire and on the borders of Lancashire, little or nothing
has yet been done, with some few conspicuous and honourable exceptions,
to satisfy the requirements of the law in this respect.”

The first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their
unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset--a process which
gave them the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had
sustained no injury, beyond sundry rents in their garments, and various
lacerations from the brambles. The next thing to be done was, to
unharness the horse. This complicated process having been effected,
the party walked slowly forward, leading the horse among them, and
abandoning the chaise to its fate.

BLACK DRIVER (to the horses).  ‘Hi!’

‘Lord, my darling,’ said Fanny, tartly. ‘You might as well ask me how
I know when a man is struck with myself! But, of course I do know. It
happens pretty often: but I always know it. I know this in much the same
way, I suppose. At all events, I know it.’

All here send kindest love to your dear good sister and all the house.

Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did
lift himself some inches out of his chair. “Hear this!” he helplessly
exclaimed to the elements. “Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for
people’s poor grandpapa’s positions!” Then he let himself down again,
and became silent.

I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more
about it. So I said as much. I said it lightly, because I felt her
trembling.

‘Now, get up, Mrs Lammle, and let us speak reasonably.’

CHAPTER 45

"Lord bless my soul!" cried Mr. Spiker.

The visitor was standing in the doorway, but turned a little into the
gloom of the house as Mr Flintwinch turned, and pursued him with his
eyes into the little room, where he groped about for a phosphorus box.
When he found it, it was damp, or otherwise out of order; and match
after match that he struck into it lighted sufficiently to throw a dull
glare about his groping face, and to sprinkle his hands with pale little
spots of fire, but not sufficiently to light the candle. The stranger,
taking advantage of this fitful illumination of his visage, looked
intently and wonderingly at him. Jeremiah, when he at last lighted
the candle, knew he had been doing this, by seeing the last shade of
a lowering watchfulness clear away from his face, as it broke into the
doubtful smile that was a large ingredient in its expression.

CHAPTER I.
TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH

“It must have been something, love,” urged Mr. Bumble. “Won’t you tell
your own B.?”

IT was profoundly observed by a witty member of the Court of Common
Council, in Council assembled in the City of London, in the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty, that the French are a
frog-eating people, who wear wooden shoes.

While she was speaking, Redlaw had come in, and, after pausing for a
moment to observe the group of which she was the centre, had silently
ascended the stairs. Upon those stairs he now appeared again; remaining
there, while the young student passed him, and came running down.

Symbolic Education, by Susan E. Blow.

Wherever Agnes was, some agreeable token of her noiseless presence
seemed inseparable from the place. When I came back, I found my aunt’s
birds hanging, just as they had hung so long in the parlour window of
the cottage; and my easy-chair imitating my aunt’s much easier chair in
its position at the open window; and even the round green fan, which my
aunt had brought away with her, screwed on to the window-sill. I knew
who had done all this, by its seeming to have quietly done itself; and I
should have known in a moment who had arranged my neglected books in the
old order of my school days, even if I had supposed Agnes to be miles
away, instead of seeing her busy with them, and smiling at the disorder
into which they had fallen.

Nepho now lurked=> Nephelo now lurked {pg 321}

While he said this in tones of the greatest indignation, he handed us
into the little phaeton with the utmost gentleness and was all smiles
and pleasure.

The Captain then withdrew to his former place, where he stood arranging
his scattered locks with the air of a man who had given the finishing
touch to a difficult performance.

Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about
me. Now that the state of doubt was over, I felt, for many days, like
one in a dream. I never thought that I had a curious couple of
guardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick. I never thought of anything about
myself, distinctly. The two things clearest in my mind were, that a
remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life--which seemed to lie
in the haze of an immeasurable distance; and that a curtain had for ever
fallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby's. No one has ever raised that
curtain since. I have lifted it for a moment, even in this narrative,
with a reluctant hand, and dropped it gladly. The remembrance of that
life is fraught with so much pain to me, with so much mental suffering
and want of hope, that I have never had the courage even to examine how
long I was doomed to lead it. Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or
less, I do not know. I only know that it was, and ceased to be; and that
I have written, and there I leave it.

BOB. Unfortunate! Think of Tiny Tim's disappointment--no goose--no
pudding--no nothing!

I thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, I
recollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with his
handsome face turned up, and his head reclining easily on his arm. He
was a person of great power in my eyes; that was of course the reason of
my mind running on him. No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the
moonbeams. There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps, in the garden
that I dreamed of walking in all night.

Mr Lammle sparkled at him, but frowned at him too.

‘Mrs. Sanders is going, she is,’ replied Tommy; ‘I’m going too, I am.’

“Hark!” cried the young lady, listening. “Did she call! I thought I
heard her voice.”

"Take care, then, that you never open your mouth to mortal about it, or
you'll be hanged, as sure as your name is Andy Rooney."

"Will _she_ go with me?" he inquired.

In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence,--an
inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble
and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy,--an excessive
nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been
prepared, no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish
traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical
conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and
sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the
animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic
concision,--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding
enunciation,--that leaden, self-balanced, and perfectly modulated
guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the
irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense
excitement.

‘Improving company!’ said Mr. Rogers, for that, it seemed, was the name
of the red-faced man. ‘You may say I am improving company, for I’ve
improved you all to some purpose; though as to my conversation being as
my friend Mr. Ellis here describes it, that is not for me to say
anything about. You, gentlemen, are the best judges on that point; but
this I will say, when I came into this parish, and first used this
room, ten years ago, I don’t believe there was one man in it, who knew
he was a slave—and now you all know it, and writhe under it. Inscribe
that upon my tomb, and I am satisfied.’

When a church clock strikes, on houseless ears in the dead of the night,
it may be at first mistaken for company and hailed as such.  But, as the
spreading circles of vibration, which you may perceive at such a time
with great clearness, go opening out, for ever and ever afterwards
widening perhaps (as the philosopher has suggested) in eternal space, the
mistake is rectified and the sense of loneliness is profounder.  Once—it
was after leaving the Abbey and turning my face north—I came to the great
steps of St. Martin’s church as the clock was striking Three.  Suddenly,
a thing that in a moment more I should have trodden upon without seeing,
rose up at my feet with a cry of loneliness and houselessness, struck out
of it by the bell, the like of which I never heard.  We then stood face
to face looking at one another, frightened by one another.  The creature
was like a beetle-browed hair-lipped youth of twenty, and it had a loose
bundle of rags on, which it held together with one of its hands.  It
shivered from head to foot, and its teeth chattered, and as it stared at
me—persecutor, devil, ghost, whatever it thought me—it made with its
whining mouth as if it were snapping at me, like a worried dog.
Intending to give this ugly object money, I put out my hand to stay
it—for it recoiled as it whined and snapped—and laid my hand upon its
shoulder.  Instantly, it twisted out of its garment, like the young man
in the New Testament, and left me standing alone with its rags in my
hands.

‘True,’ assented Jeremiah. ‘I was going to do so. Please to stand where
you are while I get one.’

‘All lost, spent, wasted, pawned, borrowed, and sold, eh?’ said the
client, looking up.

"Well, he is just the size I want," said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.

Section D.  Statistics

Sir Leicester feels it to be right and fitting that the housekeeper
of Chesney Wold should be a remarkable person. Apart from that, he
has a real regard for Mrs. Rouncewell and likes to hear her praised.
So he says, “You are right, Volumnia,” which Volumnia is extremely
glad to hear.

“Why, Wal”r,” said the Captain, turning his eyes upon him with a faint
approach to a severe expression, “ain’t I been on the look-out for any
tidings of that man o’ science, old Sol Gills, your Uncle, day and
night, ever since I lost him? Ain’t my heart been heavy and watchful
always, along of him and you? Sleeping and waking, ain’t I been upon my
post, and wouldn’t I scorn to quit it while this here Midshipman held
together!”

Some of our readers will think we are about to publish the works of
_Head_ in the usual popular monthly series; but we see no reason why old
Burton should have it all to himself, and why a pleasant anatomy (which
must be an anatomy of pleasure) should not compete with the Anatomy of
Melancholy!

My "lost character" was one of those awful documents occasionally to be
met with, which WILL be everywhere. It glared upon me from every drawer
I had, fell out of books, lurked under keys, hid in empty inkstands, got
into portfolios, frightened me by inscrutably passing into locked
despatch-boxes, and was not one character, but a thousand. This was when
I didn't want it. I look for it this morning, and it is nowhere!
Probably will never be beheld again.

My dear old Parr, I don't believe a word you write about King John! That
is to say, I don't believe you take into account the enormous difference
between the energy summonable-up in your study at Sherborne and the
energy that will fire up in you (without so much as saying "With your
leave" or "By your leave") in the Town Hall at Birmingham. I know you,
you ancient codger, I know you! Therefore I will trouble you to be so
good as to do an act of honesty after you have been to Birmingham, and
to write to me, "Ingenuous boy, you were correct. I find I could have
read 'em 'King John' with the greatest ease."

But never in all his life had the Captain’s face so shone and
glistened, as when, at last, he sat stationary at the tea-board,
looking from Florence to Walter, and from Walter to Florence. Nor was
this effect produced or at all heightened by the immense quantity of
polishing he had administered to his face with his coat-sleeve during
the last half-hour. It was solely the effect of his internal emotions.
There was a glory and delight within the Captain that spread itself
over his whole visage, and made a perfect illumination there.

‘Wanted to see what it was like,’ returned Louisa, shortly.

“_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”

I am exceedingly sorry to find, from the letter you have addressed to
me, that you had just cause of complaint in being excluded from my
reading here last night. It will now and then unfortunately happen when
the place of reading is small (as in this case), that some confusion
and inconvenience arise from the local agents over-estimating, in
perfect good faith and sincerity, the capacity of the room. Such a
mistake, I am assured, was made last night; and thus all the available
space was filled before the people in charge were at all prepared for
that circumstance.

“My dear,” said Caddy, delighted, “you can’t think how you cheer me.
I shall owe you, you don’t know how much. What changes, Esther, even
in my small world! You recollect that first night, when I was so
unpolite and inky? Who would have thought, then, of my ever teaching
people to dance, of all other possibilities and impossibilities!”

‘Sir?’ replied a man with a dirty complexion, and a towel of the same,
emerging from the kennel before mentioned.

"Dead, Mr. Peggotty?" I hinted, after a respectful pause.

‘ALTRO!’ returned John Baptist, closing his eyes and giving his head a
most vehement toss. The word being, according to its Genoese emphasis,
a confirmation, a contradiction, an assertion, a denial, a taunt,
a compliment, a joke, and fifty other things, became in the present
instance, with a significance beyond all power of written expression,
our familiar English ‘I believe you!’

‘Are you really serious, Mr Clennam? Don’t you see?’

“Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,” said Mr. Kenge.

Like a dingy London bird among the birds at roost in these pleasant
fields, where the sheep are all made into parchment, the goats into
wigs, and the pasture into chaff, the lawyer, smoke-dried and faded,
dwelling among mankind but not consorting with them, aged without
experience of genial youth, and so long used to make his cramped nest
in holes and corners of human nature that he has forgotten its
broader and better range, comes sauntering home. In the oven made by
the hot pavements and hot buildings, he has baked himself dryer than
usual; and he has in his thirsty mind his mellowed port-wine half a
century old.

‘Yes, I paid it, every farthing,’ replied Squeers, who seemed to know
the man he had to deal with, too well to suppose that any blinking of
the question would induce him to subscribe towards the expenses; ‘I
wasn’t out of pocket by it after all, either.’

Chapter 25

Joe walked into the room. A group of half-a-dozen fellows had gathered
together in the taproom, and were listening with greedy ears. One of
them, a carter in a smockfrock, seemed wavering and disposed to enlist.
The rest, who were by no means disposed, strongly urged him to do so
(according to the custom of mankind), backed the serjeant’s arguments,
and grinned among themselves. ‘I say nothing, boys,’ said the serjeant,
who sat a little apart, drinking his liquor. ‘For lads of spirit’--here
he cast an eye on Joe--‘this is the time. I don’t want to inveigle you.
The king’s not come to that, I hope. Brisk young blood is what we
want; not milk and water. We won’t take five men out of six. We want
top-sawyers, we do. I’m not a-going to tell tales out of school, but,
damme, if every gentleman’s son that carries arms in our corps, through
being under a cloud and having little differences with his relations,
was counted up’--here his eye fell on Joe again, and so good-naturedly,
that Joe beckoned him out. He came directly.

My dear Sir, very faithfully yours.

‘At all events,’ said Clennam--‘this sounds as if we were exchanging
compliments, but we know we are not--I shall have the advantage of as
plain an explanation as can be given.’

_Belle._ It matters little to you. To you very little. Another idol has
displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I
would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.

“Ah, Richards!” said Mrs Chick, with a sigh. “It would have been much
more satisfactory to those who wish to think well of their fellow
creatures, and much more becoming in you, if you had shown some proper
feeling, in time, for the little child that is now going to be
prematurely deprived of its natural nourishment.

“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “My opinion is, it’s a
sedan-chair. She’s flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flighty
enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”

"_I_ consent," replied George Vendale, readily.

The apartments which Mr Dombey reserved for his own inhabiting, were
attainable from the hall, and consisted of a sitting-room; a library,
which was in fact a dressing-room, so that the smell of hot-pressed
paper, vellum, morocco, and Russia leather, contended in it with the
smell of divers pairs of boots; and a kind of conservatory or little
glass breakfast-room beyond, commanding a prospect of the trees before
mentioned, and, generally speaking, of a few prowling cats. These three
rooms opened upon one another. In the morning, when Mr Dombey was at
his breakfast in one or other of the two first-mentioned of them, as
well as in the afternoon when he came home to dinner, a bell was rung
for Richards to repair to this glass chamber, and there walk to and fro
with her young charge. From the glimpses she caught of Mr Dombey at
these times, sitting in the dark distance, looking out towards the
infant from among the dark heavy furniture—the house had been inhabited
for years by his father, and in many of its appointments was
old-fashioned and grim—she began to entertain ideas of him in his
solitary state, as if he were a lone prisoner in a cell, or a strange
apparition that was not to be accosted or understood. Mr Dombey came to
be, in the course of a few days, invested in his own person, to her
simple thinking, with all the mystery and gloom of his house. As she
walked up and down the glass room, or sat hushing the baby there—which
she very often did for hours together, when the dusk was closing in,
too—she would sometimes try to pierce the gloom beyond, and make out
how he was looking and what he was doing. Sensible that she was plainly
to be seen by him, however, she never dared to pry in that direction
but very furtively and for a moment at a time. Consequently she made
out nothing, and Mr Dombey in his den remained a very shade.

‘Often,’ answered the first woman.

“Bad!” says Mr. Bagnet. “Not my opinion.”

There was a short silence, during which the two spectators approached
the bed. The sick man drew a hand of his old fellow-prisoner towards
him, and pressing it affectionately between both his own, retained it
in his grasp.

‘Because, my dear,’ returned Eugene, ‘there’s nobody who makes it worth
my while. Have you considered my suggestion, Lizzie?’ This in a lower
voice, but only as if it were a graver matter; not at all to the
exclusion of the person of the house.

On one of the door-posts at this inn, was a tin plate, whereon was
inscribed in characters of gold, ‘Doctor Crocus;’ and on a sheet of
paper, pasted up by the side of this plate, was a written announcement
that Dr. Crocus would that evening deliver a lecture on Phrenology for
the benefit of the Belleville public; at a charge, for admission, of so
much a head.

As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits, and as I
always associated something ludicrous with the visitor, it fell out
that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old
proposal and his subsequent retraction. “After that,” said my
guardian, “we will certainly receive this hero.” So instructions were
given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again, and they
were scarcely given when he did come again.

Ever faithfully yours.

‘There’s not enough there,’ said the girl. ‘I want it in the
street.’

Marguerite did not answer, but allowed him to enter, and closed the door
behind him. He was going to pass from the narrow and gloomy ante-chamber
into an inner room--whence now proceeded a sound of loud coughing--when
the old woman laid her hand on his arm, and raising herself on tip-toe
to reach his ear, whispered:

Jonas stopped to listen. Then said, hurriedly:

Trotty turned to look upon his guide. But, the Spirit of the child had
taken flight. Was gone.

‘Eh!’ growled Ralph, whose quick ears had caught the inquiry. ‘Do you
wish to be introduced to Mr. Squeers, my dear?’

How the time wears, I know not; until I am recalled by my child-wife's
old companion. More restless than he was, he crawls out of his house,
and looks at me, and wanders to the door, and whines to go up-stairs.

It must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,
when one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was
reading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o’clock
as I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St.
John how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the
dust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.

Scrooge lay in this state until he remembered, on a sudden, that the
Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled One. He
resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and considering that he
could not go to sleep, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his
power.

‘I hate you!’ cried Bella, turning suddenly upon him, with a stamp of
her little foot—‘at least, I can’t hate you, but I don’t like you!’

"Very," replied Grimaldi, helping himself again; "they are delicious."

"Yes, I know I am wrong," she pleaded timidly, "don't think any worse of
me; it has grown up with me here."

One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that
evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to
evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (which, to
do him justice, was by no means an habitual weakness with him;) and,
with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist
him in his toilet straightway.

“No, no, to be sure,” replied the Jew; “you were too stout-hearted for
that. A deal too stout, my dear!”

Leibnitz being every way superior to Malebranche, one might, _a
fortiori_, have counted on _his_ being murdered; which, however, was not
the case. I believe he was nettled at this neglect, and felt himself
insulted by the security in which he passed his days. In no other way
can I explain his conduct at the latter end of his life, when he chose
to grow very avaricious, and to hoard up large sums of gold, which he
kept in his own house. This was at Vienna, where he died; and letters
are still in existence, describing the immeasurable anxiety which he
entertained for his throat. Still his ambition, for being _attempted_ at
least, was so great, that he would not forego the danger. A late English
pedagogue, of Birmingham manufacture, namely, Dr. Parr, took a more
selfish course, under the same circumstances. He had amassed a
considerable quantity of gold and silver plate, which was for some time
deposited in his bedroom at his parsonage house, Hatton. But growing
every day more afraid of being murdered, which he knew that he could not
stand, and to which, indeed, he never had the slightest pretension, he
transferred the whole to the Hatton blacksmith; conceiving, no doubt,
that the murder of a blacksmith would fall more lightly on the _salus
reipublicæ_ than that of a pedagogue. But I have heard this greatly
disputed; and it seems now generally agreed that one good horseshoe is
worth about two and one fourth Spital sermons.

Just as the clock struck three, there was blown into the crescent a
sedan-chair with Mrs. Dowler inside, borne by one short fat chairman,
and one long thin one, who had much ado to keep their bodies
perpendicular: to say nothing of the chair. But on that high ground,
and in the crescent, which the wind swept round and round, as if it
were going to tear the paving stones up, its fury was tremendous.
They were very glad to set the chair down, and give a good round loud
double-knock at the street door.

"Yes, he did, indeed," replied the other: "and more than that, I heard
him say to another man beside him, that 'he could lay hold of you
whenever he wanted you.'"

We give a letter to Mr. Forster on one of his books on the Commonwealth,
the "Impeachment of the Five Members;" which, as with other letters
which we are glad to publish on the subject of Mr. Forster's own works,
was not used by himself for obvious reasons.

Time and place cannot bind Mr. Bucket. Like man in the abstract, he
is here to-day and gone to-morrow—but, very unlike man indeed, he is
here again the next day. This evening he will be casually looking
into the iron extinguishers at the door of Sir Leicester Dedlock’s
house in town; and to-morrow morning he will be walking on the leads
at Chesney Wold, where erst the old man walked whose ghost is
propitiated with a hundred guineas. Drawers, desks, pockets, all
things belonging to him, Mr. Bucket examines. A few hours afterwards,
he and the Roman will be alone together comparing forefingers.

OFFICE OF "ALL THE YEAR ROUND,"
                                         _Wednesday, Aug. 28th, 1861._

"'Cobbs,' says Master Harry, one evening, when Cobbs was watering the
flowers, 'I am going on a visit, this present mid-summer, to my
grandmamma's at York.'

‘You had better say he won’t,’ replied the chairman.

As they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart
of the turmoil, the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more
forcibly on the senses. The streets were thronged with working-people.
The hum of labour resounded from every house, lights gleamed from the
long casement windows in the attic stories, and the whirl of wheels and
noise of machinery shook the trembling walls. The fires, whose lurid,
sullen light had been visible for miles, blazed fiercely up, in the
great works and factories of the town. The din of hammers, the rushing
of steam, and the dead heavy clanking of engines, was the harsh music
which arose from every quarter.

“Yes,” said I.

"'Ooded woman with a howl," said Ikey, in a state of great
freshness.

‘Really--’ Ralph began in his usual tones.

"What is it, love?"

Susannah Sanders was then called, and examined by Serjeant Buzfuz,
and cross-examined by Serjeant Snubbin. Had always said and believed
that Pickwick would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew that Mrs. Bardell's
being engaged to Pickwick was the current topic of conversation in
the neighbourhood, after the fainting in July; had been told it
herself by Mrs. Mudberry which kept a mangle, and Mrs. Bunkin which
clear-starched, but did not see either Mrs. Mudberry or Mrs. Bunkin in
court. Had heard Pickwick ask the little boy how he should like to have
another father. Did not know that Mrs. Bardell was at that time keeping
company with the baker, but did know that the baker was then a single
man and is now married. Couldn't swear that Mrs. Bardell was not very
fond of the baker, but should think that the baker was not very fond
of Mrs. Bardell, or he wouldn't have married somebody else. Thought
Mrs. Bardell fainted away on the morning in July, because Pickwick
asked her to name the day: knew that she (witness) fainted away stone
dead when Mr. Sanders asked _her_ to name the day, and believed that
everybody as called herself a lady would do the same, under similar
circumstances. Heard Pickwick ask the boy the question about the
marbles, but upon her oath did not know the difference between an alley
tor and a commoney.

MY DEAR MRS. GASKELL,

‘Talking of a siege,’ said Tibbs, with a mouthful of bread—‘when I was
in the volunteer corps, in eighteen hundred and six, our commanding
officer was Sir Charles Rampart; and one day, when we were exercising
on the ground on which the London University now stands, he says, says
he, Tibbs (calling me from the ranks), Tibbs—’

“Would you though?” returned Krook, grinning. “You’re bearing hard
upon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, sir, though
perhaps it is but nat’ral in a Jarndyce. The burnt child, sir! What,
you’re looking at my lodger’s birds, Mr. Jarndyce?” The old man had
come by little and little into the room until he now touched my
guardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his
spectacled eyes. “It’s one of her strange ways that she’ll never tell
the names of these birds if she can help it, though she named ’em
all.” This was in a whisper. “Shall I run ’em over, Flite?” he asked
aloud, winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away,
affecting to sweep the grate.

"You see," said Mr. Peggotty, "knowing as you was partial to a little
relish with your wittles when you was along with us, we took the
liberty. The old Mawther biled 'em, she did. Mrs. Gummidge biled 'em.
Yes," said Mr. Peggotty slowly, who I thought appeared to stick to the
subject on account of having no other subject ready, "Mrs. Gummidge, I
do assure you, she biled 'em."

“Yes, sir”; replied the servant. “The old gentleman, the housekeeper,
and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow’s, all went together.”

‘Are there many of them?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick dubiously.

Then they'll play up a tune in the Royal Saloon,
    And the people will dance by the light of the moon,
    And keep up the ball till the next day at noon;
    And the peer and the peasant, the lord and the loon,
    The haughty grandee, and the low picaroon,
    The six-foot life-guardsman, and little gossoon,
    Will all join in three cheers for the "monstre" balloon.

‘I am glad this man has entered,’ observed Sir Joseph, looking round
serenely.  ‘Don’t disturb him.  It appears to be Ordained.  He is an
example: a living example.  I hope and trust, and confidently expect,
that it will not be lost upon my Friends here.’

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

"What! Where!" exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter, starting up, in an affected
rapture of surprise.

3. I suppose ---- to be, as Mr. Samuel Weller expresses it somewhere in
"Pickwick," "ravin' mad with the consciousness o' willany." Under their
advertisement in _The Times_ to-day, you will see, without a word of
comment, the shorthand writer's verbatim report of the judgment.

Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to
raise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.

And have we lost thee!--has the monarch grim
    To his dull court borne off the child of whim!
    And art thou gone, _Oldboy_?[26] thou brave and good
    _Protector_[27] of the _Children in the Wood_?

The day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even against the flaming
lights within.  The lights were turned out, and the work went on.  The
rain fell, and the Smoke-serpents, submissive to the curse of all that
tribe, trailed themselves upon the earth.  In the waste-yard outside, the
steam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the
shining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of
mist and rain.

"Never mind," said the one-eyed man, calling after the girl as she left
the room. "I'll step out by-and-by, Mary. Keep your spirits up, dear."
Here he went through the not very difficult process of winking upon
the company with his solitary eye, to the enthusiastic delight of an
elderly personage with a dirty face and a clay pipe.

WHAT WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAPS THAT WERE SET

Little Jacob stemmed the course of two tears which he was squeezing out
of his eyes, and instantly subsided into a silent horror.

"Mr. Vendale," repeated the notary.  "Just so.  I have heard and read of
the name, several times within these two months.  The name of the
unfortunate English gentleman who was killed on the Simplon.  When you
got that scar upon your cheek and neck."

‘On board serving as third mate was George Radfoot. I knew nothing of
him. His name first became known to me about a week before we sailed,
through my being accosted by one of the ship-agent’s clerks as
“Mr Radfoot.” It was one day when I had gone aboard to look to my
preparations, and the clerk, coming behind me as I stood on deck, tapped
me on the shoulder, and said, “Mr Rad-foot, look here,” referring to
some papers that he had in his hand. And my name first became known to
Radfoot, through another clerk within a day or two, and while the ship
was yet in port, coming up behind him, tapping him on the shoulder and
beginning, “I beg your pardon, Mr Harmon—.” I believe we were alike
in bulk and stature but not otherwise, and that we were not strikingly
alike, even in those respects, when we were together and could be
compared.

‘Now listen, you young limb,’ whispered Sikes, drawing a dark
lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver’s
face; ‘I’m a going to put you through there. Take this light; go
softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall,
to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.’

MY DEAR MR. CHAPPELL,

Andy made a bow and a scrape, and left the squire, who hoped the secret
was safe. He then took a ruminating walk round the pleasure-grounds,
revolving plans of retaliation upon his false friend O'Grady; and
having determined to put the most severe and sudden measure of the law
in force against him for the monies in which he was indebted to him,
he only awaited the arrival of Murtough Murphy from Dublin to execute
his vengeance. Having settled this in his own mind, he became more
contented, and said, with a self-satisfied nod of the head, "We'll see
who's the _bladdher_."

The most current and probable story, however, observes that Tom Walker
grew so anxious about the fate of his wife and his property that he
set out at length to seek them both at the Indian fort. During a long
summer's afternoon he searched about the gloomy place, but no wife was
to be seen. He called her name repeatedly, but she was nowhere to be
heard. The bittern alone responded to his voice, as he flew screaming
by; or the bull-frog croaked dolefully from a neighboring pool. At
length, it is said, just in the brown hour of twilight, when the owls
began to hoot and the bats to flit about, his attention was attracted
by the clamor of carrion crows hovering about a cypress-tree. He
looked up and beheld a bundle tied in a check apron and hanging in
the branches of the tree, with a great vulture perched hard by, as
if keeping watch upon it. He leaped with joy, for he recognized his
wife's apron, and supposed it to contain the household valuables.

1838.

I took one of these opportunities of mentioning my doubts of Mr.
Skimpole as a good adviser for Richard.

These directions were not issued without a previous knowledge of the
enemy’s tactics, for when Walter got downstairs, Mrs MacStinger glided
out of the little back kitchen, like an avenging spirit. But not
gliding out upon the Captain, as she had expected, she merely made a
further allusion to the knocker, and glided in again.

"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the gentlemen,
referring to his list. "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge,
or Mr. Marley?"

Fagin nodded yes.

‘Very well, thankee, uncle,’ returned Mr. Sempronius, who had just
appeared, looking something like a ringdove, with a small circle round
each eye: the result of his constant corking. ‘Of course we see you on
Thursday.’

With our united kind regard to yourself and Dr. Storrar, I entreat your
pity and compassion for an unfortunate wretch whom a too-confiding
disposition has brought to this pass. If I had not allowed my "cheeild"
to pledge me to all manner of fellow-creatures, I and my digestion might
have been in a state of honourable independence this day.

There, too, is _Minto Hill_, as modest and shapely and smooth as
Clytie's shoulders, and _Earlston Black Hill_, with Cowdenknowes at its
foot; and there, standing stark and upright as a warder, is the stout
old _Smailholme Tower_, seen and seeing all around. It is quite curious
how unmistakable and important it looks at what must be twenty and more
miles. It is now ninety years since that "lonely infant," who has sung
its awful joys, was found in a thunderstorm, as we all know, lying on
the soft grass at the foot of the grey old Strength, clapping his hands
at each flash, and shouting, "Bonny! bonny!"

It was Saturday night, and most of the people belonging to the place
where we were going were drinking elsewhere. We found it quieter than
I had previously seen it, though quite as miserable. The kilns were
burning, and a stifling vapour set towards us with a pale-blue glare.

“Tongues in the trees, books in the running brooks,
    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”

Henry, Prince, eldest son of James I. of England, character of, 336;
    suspicions respecting his death, 338.

‘No, Pa. On the contrary, I am worse.’

"Can you come this evening?"

“My good fellow, what should I do there?  However, be that as it may, I
never was there, you may swear.”

And s’pose he won’t come back, Sir?’ said Sam.

‘Why, though I am a lawyer, Master Copperfield,’ he replied, with a dry
grin, ‘I mean, just at present, what I say.’

The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped
to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not
nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the
river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the
beacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon a
pole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with
some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was
limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,
and come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a
terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their
heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I
looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of
him. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.

“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you
are to take care of me the while.”

PRESTON, _Thursday Evening, April 22nd, 1869._

"Then, as sure as your honour's standing there, I saw him; and why
wouldn't I, when Miss _Pauline_ was to the fore as well as meself,
and----"

"Oh! That fellow!" said Steerforth, beating a lump of coal on the top of
the fire, with the poker. "Is he as soft as ever? And where the deuce
did you pick _him_ up?"

‘You think this thumped head of mine is excited?’ Eugene went on, with a
high look; ‘not so, believe me. I can say to you of the healthful music
of my pulse what Hamlet said of his. My blood is up, but wholesomely up,
when I think of it. Tell me! Shall I turn coward to Lizzie, and sneak
away with her, as if I were ashamed of her! Where would your friend’s
part in this world be, Mortimer, if she had turned coward to him, and on
immeasurably better occasion?’

There are many faces that I know, among the little crowd; faces that I
knew in church, when mine was always wondering there; faces that first
saw my mother, when she came to the village in her youthful bloom. I do
not mind them--I mind nothing but my grief--and yet I see and know them
all; and even in the background, far away, see Minnie looking on, and
her eye glancing on her sweetheart, who is near me.

"Miserum? quem minus credere 'st?
    Quid reliqui 'st, quin habeat, quæ quidem in homine dicuntur bona?
    Parentes, patriam incolumem, amicos, genu', cognatos, divitias:
    Atque hæc perinde sunt ut illius animus qui ea possidet;
    Qui uti scit, ei bona; illi, qui non utitur rectè, mala."[97]

"I came to nurse you. We have nursed you many weeks. You were moved here
long ago. Do you remember nothing?"

The little head sunk into the pillow, and Dolly recited her usual
liturgy of "Our Father who art in heaven," and "I pray God to bless my
dear father and mother and all my dear friends and relations, and make
me a good girl," and ending with

‘The elder brother, grandfather to these two children, was now a broken
man; crushed and borne down, less by the weight of years than by the
heavy hand of sorrow.  With the wreck of his possessions, he began to
trade--in pictures first, and then in curious ancient things.  He had
entertained a fondness for such matters from a boy, and the tastes he
had cultivated were now to yield him an anxious and precarious
subsistence.

In his homeward way stood the Market Cross; a fine mediæval structure,
supported on a series of circular steps by a groined arch, which served
as a canopy to the stone figure of an ancient burgess. This was the
effigies of Wynkyn de Vokes, once Mayor of Beetlebury, and a great
benefactor to the town; in which he had founded alms-houses and a
grammar-school, A. D. 1440. The post was formerly occupied by St.
Wulfstan; but De Vokes had been removed from the Town Hall in
Cromwell’s time, and promoted to the vacant pedestal, _vice_ Wulfstan,
demolished. Mr. Blenkinsop highly revered this work of art, and he now
stopped to take a view of it by moonlight. In that doubtful glimmer, it
seemed almost life-like. Mr. Blenkinsop had not much imagination, yet he
could well nigh fancy he was looking upon the veritable Wynkyn, with his
bonnet, beard, furred gown, and staff, and his great book under his arm.
So vivid was this impression, that it impelled him to apostrophize the
Statue.

As she died, the Spirit of the child returning, innocent and radiant,
touched the old man with its hand, and beckoned him away.

“Into the tunnel?” said I.

Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind’s bosom friend, as a
man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual
relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment.  So near
was Mr. Bounderby—or, if the reader should prefer it, so far off.

‘She must be newly rigged,’ said Steerforth, ‘and I shall leave Littimer
behind to see it done, that I may know she is quite complete. Did I tell
you Littimer had come down?’

‘I hope so,’ replied Montague.

It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she
would come home.

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Saturday Evening, Dec. 13th_, 1856.

His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”

‘Oh Lor!’ tittered the client. ‘THAT won’t do. Read another, young man,
will you?’

Anielka opened the door of the cabin; all was silent and deserted. The
arm-chair on which the poor old woman used to sit, was overturned in a
corner. Anielka was chilled by a fearful presentiment. She went with a
slow step towards the bee-hives; there she saw a little boy tending the
bees, whilst the old man was stretched on the ground beside him. The
rays of the sun, falling on his pale and sickly face, showed that he was
very ill. Anielka stooped down over him, and said, “It is I, it is
Anielka, your own Anielka, who always loves you.”

‘He was not at Duke Street, or at Warwick Street, G. Varden,’ said
Simon, sternly; ‘but he WAS at Westminster. Perhaps, sir, he kicked a
county member, perhaps, sir, he tapped a lord--you may stare, sir, I
repeat it--blood flowed from noses, and perhaps he tapped a lord. Who
knows? This,’ he added, putting his hand into his waistcoat-pocket,
and taking out a large tooth, at the sight of which both Miggs and Mrs
Varden screamed, ‘this was a bishop’s. Beware, G. Varden!’

The big man's face grew instantly blanched; he put his hands to his
head, made a step, or rather stagger back, and instantly disappeared,
having either fallen or thrown himself upon the floor. The friend put
his pistol in his pocket without the most remote approach to a smile
or the slightest change of countenance, and Grimaldi sank down to the
bottom of the chaise nearly suffocated with laughter.

We blush to tell it; but his youthful spirits and vivacity getting,
for the time, the better of his sad thoughts, he no sooner formed
this resolution than he saluted Miss Squeers and the friend with great
gallantry, and drawing a chair to the tea-table, began to make himself
more at home than in all probability an usher has ever done in his
employer’s house since ushers were first invented.

CHAPTER 45. — MR. DICK FULFILS MY AUNT’S PREDICTIONS

‘Is it a nice boy?’ demanded the collector.

‘No doubt of it!’ said the remainder of the company, whose attention
was now pretty well engrossed by the serious business of eating,
carving, taking wine, and so forth.

‘Ha! ha! ha!’ laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this
concession. ‘You’re like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like
yourself.’

Such was the end of the pretended Duke of York, whose shadowy history
was made more shadowy—and ever will be—by the mystery and craft of the
King. If he had turned his great natural advantages to a more honest
account, he might have lived a happy and respected life, even in those
days. But he died upon a gallows at Tyburn, leaving the Scottish lady,
who had loved him so well, kindly protected at the Queen’s Court. After
some time she forgot her old loves and troubles, as many people do with
Time’s merciful assistance, and married a Welsh gentleman. Her second
husband, Sir Matthew Cradoc, more honest and more happy than her first,
lies beside her in a tomb in the old church of Swansea.

Chapter 66

‘Oh!’ said Mrs Milvey, reassured for her own little boys.

‘Good-night,’ he said, after having sunk into a moody silence, with
his hands clasped behind him, and his eyes suspiciously wandering about
Wegg.—‘No! stop there. I know the way out, and I want no light.’

“This,” he said, again laying his hand upon my arm, and glancing over his
shoulder with hollow eyes, “was just a year ago.  Six or seven months
passed, and I had recovered from the surprise and shock, when one
morning, as the day was breaking, I, standing at the door, looked towards
the red light, and saw the spectre again.”  He stopped, with a fixed look
at me.

‘Take a glass of wine, Mr. Cripps,’ said Firebras, filling a bumper,
and handing it to the new-comer. ‘It is Beau Villiers’s chief valet,’
he added, in an undertone, to Sir Norfolk, who had made a polite though
formal bow to the stranger.

As it was not his humour to be often sought, Captain Cuttle decided not
to go or send to him next day, or until he should make his gracious
pleasure known in such wise, or failing that, until some little time
should have lapsed. The Captain, therefore, renewed his solitary life
next morning, and thought profoundly, many mornings, noons, and nights,
of old Sol Gills, and Bunsby’s sentiments concerning him, and the hopes
there were of his return. Much of such thinking strengthened Captain
Cuttle’s hopes; and he humoured them and himself by watching for the
Instrument-maker at the door—as he ventured to do now, in his strange
liberty—and setting his chair in its place, and arranging the little
parlour as it used to be, in case he should come home unexpectedly. He
likewise, in his thoughtfulness, took down a certain little miniature
of Walter as a schoolboy, from its accustomed nail, lest it should
shock the old man on his return. The Captain had his presentiments,
too, sometimes, that he would come on such a day; and one particular
Sunday, even ordered a double allowance of dinner, he was so sanguine.
But come, old Solomon did not; and still the neighbours noticed how the
seafaring man in the glazed hat, stood at the shop-door of an evening,
looking up and down the street.

Little Dorrit, in her watchful love, would have remembered the lightest
thing he said or did that night, though she had had no subsequent reason
to recall that night. She always remembered that, when he looked about
him under the strong influence of the old association, he tried to
keep it out of her mind, and perhaps out of his own too, by immediately
expatiating on the great riches and great company that had encompassed
him in his absence, and on the lofty position he and his family had to
sustain. Nor did she fail to recall that there were two under-currents,
side by side, pervading all his discourse and all his manner; one
showing her how well he had got on without her, and how independent
he was of her; the other, in a fitful and unintelligible way almost
complaining of her, as if it had been possible that she had neglected
him while he was away.

“There is a kind of pride, Sir,” she returned, after a moment’s
silence, “or what may be supposed to be pride, which is mere duty. I
hope I cherish no other.”

“That’s just it,” says Trottle, catching her up short in desperation, and
seeing his way, by the help of those last words of hers, to slipping
cleverly through her fingers.  “What should you say, if I told you that
Mr. Forley was nothing like so far from thinking about that little matter
as you fancy?  You would be disappointed, now, if I told you that I had
come to-day without the money?”—(her lank old jaw fell, and her
villainous old eyes glared, in a perfect state of panic, at that!)—“But
what should you say, if I told you that Mr. Forley was only waiting for
my report, to send me here next Monday, at dusk, with a bigger bit of
business for us two to do together than ever you think for?  What should
you say to that?”

‘It was charming, Tom!’

He had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door in
the back part of it, leading to the house-entry. As he stood with his
hand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously observed to him
before passing out, “That will do, Krook. You mean well, but are
tiresome. My young friends are pressed for time. I have none to spare
myself, having to attend court very soon. My young friends are the
wards in Jarndyce.”

When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and
the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was
performed in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box
in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch
in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and
sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight
round him, and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his
pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of
the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour
in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at
the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into
shop-windows. At such times, he would look constantly round him, for
fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to
see that he hadn’t lost anything, in such a very funny and natural
manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. All
this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out
of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was
impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon
his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates
stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they
took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box,
note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even
the spectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of
his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all
over again.

You may think, my dear friend, that I could not occupy myself with
subjects, without endeavouring to analyse my own portion of courage;
for who can undertake to study mankind without beginning and ending
with himself? Are you curious to be informed on this point? It is a
ticklish thing; but you know that I have a pleasure in being candid, and
therefore willingly withdraw, at times, the curtains of my most secret
chamber, to afford my good friends a glimpse. Listen, then: the result
will be found in that admired _juste milieu_, which certain well-known
governments have discovered without knowing it, and find that it answers
admirably well, because it may be translated by the German word _mittel
mässigkeit_ (moderation, or mediocrity.) This is just the case with me
also: in the first place, I must own to the feminine temperament No. 2,
although I would rather have belonged to No. 1; however, laws are not to
be prescribed to the Creator; and to say of myself what I think, without
maintaining it as certainly demonstrated, would be too vain on my part:
fortunately, in addition to my mediocre No. 2, I possess _a_, _b_, _c_,
thoroughly, at least in a high, if not in the highest degree.

"Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation," continued Mr.
Pickwick.

Turgesius did not sleep at the castle that night. He was summoned on a
sudden to a distance: oppression had produced reaction. In the place of
the slave, the man had started up; and the air all at once was thick
with weapons, where for months the glare of brass or of steel had not
been seen, except in the hand of the foreigner. Outposts had been driven
in; large bands were retracing steps which they had no right to take;
the sway of the freebooter was tottering. His presence saved it, and the
native again bowed sullenly to resume the yoke.

Joe paced up and down the path, sometimes stopping in affected
contemplation of the building or the prospect, sometimes leaning against
a tree with an assumed air of idleness and indifference, but always
keeping an eye upon the window he had singled out at first. After some
quarter of an hour’s delay, a small white hand was waved to him for an
instant from this casement, and the young man, with a respectful bow,
departed; saying under his breath as he crossed his horse again, ‘No
errand for me to-day!’

Don’t you remember (says the plate) how you steamed away, yesterday
morning, in the bright sun and the east wind, along the valley of the
sparkling Trent?  Don’t you recollect how many kilns you flew past,
looking like the bowls of gigantic tobacco-pipes, cut short off from the
stem and turned upside down?  And the fires—and the smoke—and the roads
made with bits of crockery, as if all the plates and dishes in the
civilised world had been Macadamised, expressly for the laming of all the
horses?  Of course I do!

LIVERPOOL, _Friday, Feb. 15th, 1867._

In this deplorable condition he remembered Mr Pinch’s book; more
because it was rather troublesome to carry, than from any hope of being
comforted by that parting gift. He looked at the dingy lettering on the
back, and finding it to be an odd volume of the ‘Bachelor of Salamanca,’
in the French tongue, cursed Tom Pinch’s folly twenty times. He was on
the point of throwing it away, in his ill-humour and vexation, when he
bethought himself that Tom had referred him to a leaf, turned down;
and opening it at that place, that he might have additional cause
of complaint against him for supposing that any cold scrap of the
Bachelor’s wisdom could cheer him in such circumstances, found!--

Mr and Mrs Boffin sat after breakfast, in the Bower, a prey to
prosperity. Mr Boffin’s face denoted Care and Complication. Many
disordered papers were before him, and he looked at them about as
hopefully as an innocent civilian might look at a crowd of troops whom
he was required at five minutes’ notice to manoeuvre and review. He had
been engaged in some attempts to make notes of these papers; but being
troubled (as men of his stamp often are) with an exceedingly distrustful
and corrective thumb, that busy member had so often interposed to
smear his notes, that they were little more legible than the various
impressions of itself; which blurred his nose and forehead. It is
curious to consider, in such a case as Mr Boffin’s, what a cheap article
ink is, and how far it may be made to go. As a grain of musk will scent
a drawer for many years, and still lose nothing appreciable of its
original weight, so a halfpenny-worth of ink would blot Mr Boffin to the
roots of his hair and the calves of his legs, without inscribing a line
on the paper before him, or appearing to diminish in the inkstand.

The countenance of Sampson fell, and anxiety overspread his features.
Instead of passionately bewailing the loss of his money, as Miss Sally
had expected, he walked on tiptoe to the door, opened it, looked
outside, shut it softly, returned on tiptoe, and said in a whisper,

‘Nothing, Sissy?’

But previously, as they were going along, Jenny twisted her venerable
friend aside to a brilliantly-lighted toy-shop window, and said: ‘Now
look at ’em! All my work!’

"What can we do, Trotwood?" said Mr. Dick. "There's the Memorial--"

“Why?”

‘My station, Mas’r Davy,’ he returned, ‘ain’t there no longer; and if
ever a boat foundered, since there was darkness on the face of the deep,
that one’s gone down. But no, sir, no; I doen’t mean as it should be
deserted. Fur from that.’

‘And this,’ said Mr Swiveller, with a kind of bantering composure, ‘is
life, I believe.  Oh, certainly.  Why not!  I’m quite satisfied.  I
shall wear,’ added Richard, taking off his hat again and looking hard
at it, as if he were only deterred by pecuniary considerations from
spurning it with his foot, ‘I shall wear this emblem of woman’s
perfidy, in remembrance of her with whom I shall never again thread the
windings of the mazy; whom I shall never more pledge in the rosy; who,
during the short remainder of my existence, will murder the balmy.  Ha,
ha, ha!’

Now, King Henry being then on bad terms with France, the French King,
Charles the Eighth, saw that, by pretending to believe in the handsome
young man, he could trouble his enemy sorely. So, he invited him over
to the French Court, and appointed him a body-guard, and treated him in
all respects as if he really were the Duke of York. Peace, however,
being soon concluded between the two Kings, the pretended Duke was
turned adrift, and wandered for protection to the Duchess of Burgundy.
She, after feigning to inquire into the reality of his claims, declared
him to be the very picture of her dear departed brother; gave him a
body-guard at her Court, of thirty halberdiers; and called him by the
sounding name of the White Rose of England.

Stanley, Dean, ii. 448, 449

‘What the devil do you knock in that way for?’ inquired the clerk
angrily.

‘_She_ won’t get anything,’ said Mr Merdle.

“Not at all. I ought to apologise for looking in so late. But having
noticed (excuse me) that you generally walk out at night, I thought I
should inconvenience you least by awaiting your return. I am always
afraid of inconveniencing busy men, being an idle man.”

‘Good day, sir.’

Mr. Dolloby rolled it up again, and gave it me back. ‘I should rob my
family,’ he said, ‘if I was to offer ninepence for it.’

At that end of Minor Canon Corner the shadow is profound in the
existing state of the light: at that end, too, there is a piece of old
dwarf wall, breast high, the only remaining boundary of what was once a
garden, but is now the thoroughfare. Jasper and Durdles would have
turned this wall in another instant; but, stopping so short, stand
behind it.

Though I had long known that his servility was false, and all his
pretences knavish and hollow, I had had no adequate conception of the
extent of his hypocrisy, until I now saw him with his mask off. The
suddenness with which he dropped it, when he perceived that it was
useless to him; the malice, insolence, and hatred, he revealed; the leer
with which he exulted, even at this moment, in the evil he had done--all
this time being desperate too, and at his wits' end for the means of
getting the better of us--though perfectly consistent with the
experience I had of him, at first took even me by surprise, who had
known him so long, and disliked him so heartily.

‘I am in the oil and colour way. My name is Snawley, sir,’ said the
stranger.

"He has been _called_ mad," said my aunt. "I have a selfish pleasure in
saying he has been called mad, or I should not have had the benefit of
his society and advice for these last ten years and upwards--in fact,
ever since your sister, Betsey Trotwood, disappointed me."

HIS SISTER-IN-LAW AND HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER.

He laughed heartily and answered, “No.”

I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance, where the people
around me made me stay; urging, as I confusedly perceived, that he was
bent on going, with help or without, and that I should endanger the
precautions for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested. I
don’t know what I answered, or what they rejoined; but I saw hurry on
the beach, and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there, and
penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me. Then, I saw
him standing alone, in a seaman’s frock and trousers: a rope in his
hand, or slung to his wrist: another round his body: and several of the
best men holding, at a little distance, to the latter, which he laid out
himself, slack upon the shore, at his feet.

‘Done with you for a tanner!’ said the long-legged young man, and
directly got upon his cart, which was nothing but a large wooden tray on
wheels, and rattled away at such a rate, that it was as much as I could
do to keep pace with the donkey.

When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—

‘A very difficult thing,’ I thought, when the discourse began, ‘to speak
appropriately to so large an audience, and to speak with tact.  Without
it, better not to speak at all.  Infinitely better, to read the New
Testament well, and to let _that_ speak.  In this congregation there is
indubitably one pulse; but I doubt if any power short of genius can touch
it as one, and make it answer as one.’

“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can be
nothing left for me to say.”

‘Well, I don’t mind that; it’s only twopence a piece more,’ said Mr.
Martin. ‘What do you say, now? We’ll pay you out for three-and-sixpence
a week. Come!’

I thought this sentiment so incompatible with the establishment of any
system of check on Mary Anne, that I frowned a little.

She held up her muffled fingers that he might touch them with his,
according to their usual custom, and he stood over her wheeled chair to
touch her face with his lips. He thought, then, that her cheek was
more strained than usual, and that it was colder. As he followed the
direction of her eyes, in rising again, towards Mr Flintwinch’s good
friend, Mr Blandois, Mr Blandois snapped his finger and thumb with one
loud contemptuous snap.

The Starlight

‘What did you say?’ inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.

‘Leave off rattlin’ that ‘ere nob o’ yourn, if you don’t want it to come
off the springs altogether,’ said Sam impatiently, ‘and behave
reasonable. I vent all the vay down to the Markis o’ Granby, arter you,
last night.’

“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile.

“I remembered your name,” he said, “when it was mentioned to me down
stairs, just now; and I recollect your face. We have held but very
little personal communication together?”

I AM not used to writing for print.  What working-man, that never labours
less (some Mondays, and Christmas Time and Easter Time excepted) than
twelve or fourteen hours a day, is?  But I have been asked to put down,
plain, what I have got to say; and so I take pen-and-ink, and do it to
the best of my power, hoping defects will find excuse.

With distracting coolness and slowness—for he knows the curiosity of
the Charmer to be always devouring—Eugene makes a pretence of getting
out an eyeglass, polishing it, and reading the paper with difficulty,
long after he has seen what is written on it. What is written on it in
wet ink, is:

“What? You’ve been a-trying to do it, have you?” says the suspicious
Krook.

A malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor, as he
drew from his pocket the _Independent_ of that morning; and laying his
finger on a particular paragraph, threw the journal across the table to
Mr. Winkle.

"Sure, an' it's myself, an' no relation at all," shouted Darby from
below, indignantly.

There was nothing left for him to do.  He must face the world again; but
_anything_--he told himself--would be better than this.  So he packed up
a few clothes in a small valise, and, finding that nobody offered to
oppose him, he marched boldly out by the front door and struck into the
road which led to Greta Bridge.

"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig alive again!"

As this sounded mysterious to the children, and moreover was like the
beginning of a favorite story Agnes used to tell them, introductory to
the arrival of a wicked old Fairy in a cloak who hated every body, it
produced some commotion. One of our boys laid his head in his mother's
lap to be out of harm's way, and little Agnes (our eldest child) left
her doll in a chair to represent her, and thrust out her little heap of
golden curls from between the window-curtains, to see what happened
next.

So she tried to do. At times, and often too, wondering speculations on
the cause of this change in Edith, would obtrude themselves upon her
mind and frighten her; but in the calm of its abandonment once more to
silent grief and loneliness, it was not a curious mind. Florence had
only to remember that her star of promise was clouded in the general
gloom that hung upon the house, and to weep and be resigned.

"His Grace thought them excellent."

The Jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could
have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude, and,
seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant’s head. But
Charley Bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly
terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full
at that young gentleman.

Secondly, as to the absence of the comic element. I really do not see
how more of it could be got into the story, and I think Mr. Boucicault
underrates the pleasant effect of his own part. The very notion of a
sailor, whose life is not among those little courts and streets, and
whose business does not lie with the monotonous machinery, but with the
four wild winds, is a relief to me in reading the play. I am quite
confident of its being an immense relief to the audience when they see
the sailor before them, with an entirely different bearing, action,
dress, complexion even, from the rest of the men. I would make him the
freshest and airiest sailor that ever was seen; and through him I can
distinctly see my way out of "the Black Country" into clearer air. (I
speak as one of the audience, mind.) I should like something of this
contrast to be expressed in the dialogue between the sailor and Jew, in
the second scene of the second act. Again, I feel Widdicomb's part
(which is charming, and ought to make the whole house cry) most
agreeable and welcome, much better than any amount in such a story, of
mere comicality.

CHAPTER VII.

But, the old abhorrence grew stronger on her as she grew weaker, and
it found more sustaining food than she did in her wanderings. Now, she
would light upon the shameful spectacle of some desolate creature—or
some wretched ragged groups of either sex, or of both sexes, with
children among them, huddled together like the smaller vermin for
a little warmth—lingering and lingering on a doorstep, while the
appointed evader of the public trust did his dirty office of trying to
weary them out and so get rid of them. Now, she would light upon some
poor decent person, like herself, going afoot on a pilgrimage of
many weary miles to see some worn-out relative or friend who had been
charitably clutched off to a great blank barren Union House, as far from
old home as the County Jail (the remoteness of which is always its worst
punishment for small rural offenders), and in its dietary, and in
its lodging, and in its tending of the sick, a much more penal
establishment. Sometimes she would hear a newspaper read out, and would
learn how the Registrar General cast up the units that had within the
last week died of want and of exposure to the weather: for which that
Recording Angel seemed to have a regular fixed place in his sum, as if
they were its halfpence. All such things she would hear discussed, as
we, my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, in our unapproachable
magnificence never hear them, and from all such things she would fly
with the wings of raging Despair.

‘It’s a strange way of going,’ he said, glancing at Swiveller, ‘very
strange not to communicate with me who am such a close and intimate
friend of his!  Ah! he’ll write to me no doubt, or he’ll bid Nelly
write--yes, yes, that’s what he’ll do.  Nelly’s very fond of me.
Pretty Nell!’

There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had
been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against
society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed
by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the
appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to
spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than
in a musical instrument. He made no answer: being occupied mentally
bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the
use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked
there.

"My name, sir," replied the old man most unexpectedly, "is Dorrit."

The buxom female shook her head with a compassionate and sympathising
air; and, appealing to Sam, inquired whether his father really ought
not to make an effort to keep up, and not give way to that lowness of
spirits.

Changeless and barren, looking ignorantly at all the seasons with its
fixed, pinched face of poverty and care, the prison had not a touch of
any of these beauties on it. Blossom what would, its bricks and bars
bore uniformly the same dead crop. Yet Clennam, listening to the voice
as it read to him, heard in it all that great Nature was doing, heard in
it all the soothing songs she sings to man. At no Mother’s knee but hers
had he ever dwelt in his youth on hopeful promises, on playful fancies,
on the harvests of tenderness and humility that lie hidden in the
early-fostered seeds of the imagination; on the oaks of retreat from
blighting winds, that have the germs of their strong roots in nursery
acorns. But, in the tones of the voice that read to him, there were
memories of an old feeling of such things, and echoes of every merciful
and loving whisper that had ever stolen to him in his life.

‘Have you heard this opera of to-night, Fledgeby?’ he asked, stopping
very short, to prevent himself from running on into ‘confound you.’

There were foreign sailors, of all nations, in the streets; with red
shirts, blue shirts, buff shirts, tawny shirts, and shirts of orange
colour; with red caps, blue caps, green caps, great beards, and no
beards; in Turkish turbans, glazed English hats, and Neapolitan
head-dresses.  There were the townspeople sitting in clusters on the
pavement, or airing themselves on the tops of their houses, or walking up
and down the closest and least airy of Boulevards; and there were crowds
of fierce-looking people of the lower sort, blocking up the way,
constantly.  In the very heart of all this stir and uproar, was the
common madhouse; a low, contracted, miserable building, looking straight
upon the street, without the smallest screen or court-yard; where
chattering mad-men and mad-women were peeping out, through rusty bars, at
the staring faces below, while the sun, darting fiercely aslant into
their little cells, seemed to dry up their brains, and worry them, as if
they were baited by a pack of dogs.

‘Liverer indeed!’ said Dick thoughtfully.  ‘It’s well I am a liverer.
I strongly suspect I should have died, Marchioness, but for you.’

"What a happiness it is, I'm sure," said Trotty, "to be so esteemed. How
kind and neighborly you are! It's all along of my dear daughter. She
deserves it."

“To be sure,” says Mr. Bucket. “That makes a difference. Now I think
of it,” says Mr. Bucket, warming his hands and looking pleasantly at
the blaze, “she went out walking the very night of this business.”

"Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?" inquired Mr. Grimwig.

Tramp, tramp. Tramp, tramp. Heads erect, shoulders square, every man
stepping in exact time--all so orderly and regular--nobody looking at
him--nobody seeming conscious of his presence,--he could hardly believe
he was a Prisoner. But at the word, though only thought, not spoken, he
felt the handcuffs galling his wrists, the cord pressing his arms to
his sides: the loaded guns levelled at his head; and those cold, bright,
sharp, shining points turned towards him: the mere looking down at
which, now that he was bound and helpless, made the warm current of his
life run cold.

‘I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis.’

"Perhaps a fellow murdered?"

“I was doubtful,” he returned, “whether I had seen you before.”

Chattering away thus, according to custom, to prevent the possibility
of any thanks or acknowledgment being expressed on the other side, the
twins trotted off, arm-in-arm; having endowed Tim Linkinwater with a
costly gold snuff-box, enclosing a bank note worth more than its value
ten times told.

“It is obvious that in a work published with a view to such
considerations, no artfully interwoven or ingeniously complicated plot
can with reason be expected. The author ventures to express a hope that
he has successfully surmounted the difficulties of his undertaking. And
if it be objected to the Pickwick Papers, that they are a mere series of
adventure, in which the scenes are ever changing, and the characters
come and go like the men and women we encounter in the real world, he
can only content himself with the reflection that they claim to be
nothing else, and that the same objection has been made to the works of
some of the greatest novelists in the English language.”

‘No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,’ replied Sikes. ‘He says he’s
worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time
he’s been loitering down there, and it’s all of no use.’

There seems reason to suspect that the Dowager Queen—always a restless
and busy woman—had had some share in tutoring the baker’s son. The King
was very angry with her, whether or no. He seized upon her property,
and shut her up in a convent at Bermondsey.

As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had
walked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,
and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to
be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.

“Sir, I can do neither.”

“How little I have suspected this,” said John Carker, “when I have seen
you every day, Sir! If Harriet could have guessed your name—”

‘You shall have it in a minute,’ rejoined Thomas.  ‘My second
instance’—(Goodchild groaned, and sat down again)—‘My second instance is
more appropriate to the present time and place, for it refers to a
race-horse.  Two years ago an excellent friend of mine, who was desirous
of prevailing on me to take regular exercise, and who was well enough
acquainted with the weakness of my legs to expect no very active
compliance with his wishes on their part, offered to make me a present of
one of his horses.  Hearing that the animal in question had started in
life on the turf, I declined accepting the gift with many thanks; adding,
by way of explanation, that I looked on a race-horse as a kind of
embodied hurricane, upon which no sane man of my character and habits
could be expected to seat himself.  My friend replied that, however
appropriate my metaphor might be as applied to race-horses in general, it
was singularly unsuitable as applied to the particular horse which he
proposed to give me.  From a foal upwards this remarkable animal had been
the idlest and most sluggish of his race.  Whatever capacities for speed
he might possess he had kept so strictly to himself, that no amount of
training had ever brought them out.  He had been found hopelessly slow as
a racer, and hopelessly lazy as a hunter, and was fit for nothing but a
quiet, easy life of it with an old gentleman or an invalid.  When I heard
this account of the horse, I don’t mind confessing that my heart warmed
to him.  Visions of Thomas Idle ambling serenely on the back of a steed
as lazy as himself, presenting to a restless world the soothing and
composite spectacle of a kind of sluggardly Centaur, too peaceable in his
habits to alarm anybody, swam attractively before my eyes.  I went to
look at the horse in the stable.  Nice fellow! he was fast asleep with a
kitten on his back.  I saw him taken out for an airing by the groom.  If
he had had trousers on his legs I should not have known them from my own,
so deliberately were they lifted up, so gently were they put down, so
slowly did they get over the ground.  From that moment I gratefully
accepted my friend’s offer.  I went home; the horse followed me—by a slow
train.  Oh, Francis, how devoutly I believed in that horse I how
carefully I looked after all his little comforts!  I had never gone the
length of hiring a man-servant to wait on myself; but I went to the
expense of hiring one to wait upon him.  If I thought a little of myself
when I bought the softest saddle that could be had for money, I thought
also of my horse.  When the man at the shop afterwards offered me spurs
and a whip, I turned from him with horror.  When I sallied out for my
first ride, I went purposely unarmed with the means of hurrying my steed.
He proceeded at his own pace every step of the way; and when he stopped,
at last, and blew out both his sides with a heavy sigh, and turned his
sleepy head and looked behind him, I took him home again, as I might take
home an artless child who said to me, “If you please, sir, I am tired.”
For a week this complete harmony between me and my horse lasted
undisturbed.  At the end of that time, when he had made quite sure of my
friendly confidence in his laziness, when he had thoroughly acquainted
himself with all the little weaknesses of my seat (and their name is
Legion), the smouldering treachery and ingratitude of the equine nature
blazed out in an instant.  Without the slightest provocation from me,
with nothing passing him at the time but a pony-chaise driven by an old
lady, he started in one instant from a state of sluggish depression to a
state of frantic high spirits.  He kicked, he plunged, he shied, he
pranced, he capered fearfully.  I sat on him as long as I could, and when
I could sit no longer, I fell off.  No, Francis! this is not a
circumstance to be laughed at, but to be wept over.  What would be said
of a Man who had requited my kindness in that way?  Range over all the
rest of the animal creation, and where will you find me an instance of
treachery so black as this?  The cow that kicks down the milking-pail may
have some reason for it; she may think herself taxed too heavily to
contribute to the dilution of human tea and the greasing of human bread.
The tiger who springs out on me unawares has the excuse of being hungry
at the time, to say nothing of the further justification of being a total
stranger to me.  The very flea who surprises me in my sleep may defend
his act of assassination on the ground that I, in my turn, am always
ready to murder him when I am awake.  I defy the whole body of Natural
Historians to move me, logically, off the ground that I have taken in
regard to the horse.  Receive back your hat, Brother Francis, and go to
the chemist’s, if you please; for I have now done.  Ask me to take
anything you like, except an interest in the Doncaster races.  Ask me to
look at anything you like, except an assemblage of people all animated by
feelings of a friendly and admiring nature towards the horse.  You are a
remarkably well-informed man, and you have heard of hermits.  Look upon
me as a member of that ancient fraternity, and you will sensibly add to
the many obligations which Thomas Idle is proud to owe to Francis
Goodchild.’

“I can afford to be laughed at,” said the younger Fid, “because I have
gained immeasurably by the delusion, if it be one; but if ever there was
a ghost, I have seen the ghost of James Barber. I, like yourself and he,
was nearly ruined by love of amusement and intemperance, when he--or
whatever else it might have been--came to my aid.”

To enable this girl to earn her few weekly shillings, it was necessary
for the Child of the Marshalsea to go through a careful form with her

‘“Don’t,” said my uncle, interrupting her.

The windows stood open, and the twilight was gathering without.

‘Yes, sir, and puppies, and pug-dogs likewise,’ replied his uncle,
taking a chair. ‘You didn’t mention in your letter what my brother’s
complaint was, ma’am.’

“That is more like the composed look you comforted me with, my dear,

hair. “When you are mistress of Bleak House, you are to be as

Staggs’s Gardens was uncommonly incredulous. It was a little row of
houses, with little squalid patches of ground before them, fenced off
with old doors, barrel staves, scraps of tarpaulin, and dead bushes;
with bottomless tin kettles and exhausted iron fenders, thrust into the
gaps. Here, the Staggs’s Gardeners trained scarlet beans, kept fowls
and rabbits, erected rotten summer-houses (one was an old boat), dried
clothes, and smoked pipes. Some were of opinion that Staggs’s Gardens
derived its name from a deceased capitalist, one Mr Staggs, who had
built it for his delectation. Others, who had a natural taste for the
country, held that it dated from those rural times when the antlered
herd, under the familiar denomination of Staggses, had resorted to its
shady precincts. Be this as it may, Staggs’s Gardens was regarded by
its population as a sacred grove not to be withered by Railroads; and
so confident were they generally of its long outliving any such
ridiculous inventions, that the master chimney-sweeper at the corner,
who was understood to take the lead in the local politics of the
Gardens, had publicly declared that on the occasion of the Railroad
opening, if ever it did open, two of his boys should ascend the flues
of his dwelling, with instructions to hail the failure with derisive
cheers from the chimney-pots.

Some of the more vigorous-minded women, not seeing their minister
among the other people in the clearing in front of the log church,
went to look for him, but he was not to be found. His wife had ordered
him to be home early, and soon after the congregation had been
dismissed he departed by a short cut through the woods. That afternoon
an irate committee, composed principally of women, but including also
a few men who had expressed disbelief in the new doctrine, arrived
at the cabin of their preacher, but found there only his wife,
cross-grained old Aunt Rebecca. She informed them that her husband was
not at home.

There is something very affecting in this. It is still more affecting
to know, that such philanthropy is but imperfectly rewarded.
Bow-street, Newgate, and Millbank, are a poor return for general
benevolence, evincing itself in an irrepressible love for all created
objects. Mr. Barker felt it so. After a lengthened interview with the
highest legal authorities, he quitted his ungrateful country, with the
consent, and at the expense, of its Government; proceeded to a distant
shore; and there employed himself, like another Cincinnatus, in
clearing and cultivating the soil—a peaceful pursuit, in which a term
of seven years glided almost imperceptibly away.

Mr. Oakhurst received his sentence with philosophic calmness, none the
less coolly that he was aware of the hesitation of his judges. He was
too much of a gambler not to accept fate. With him life was at best an
uncertain game, and he recognized the usual percentage in favor of the
dealer.

“I understand you perfectly.”

But I had wounded Dora’s soft little heart, and she was not to be
comforted. She was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing, that I felt
as if I had said I don’t know what to hurt her. I was obliged to hurry
away; I was kept out late; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as
made me miserable. I had the conscience of an assassin, and was haunted
by a vague sense of enormous wickedness.

Mrs Hominy shook her head with a melancholy smile that said, not
inexpressively, ‘They corrupt even the language in that old country!’
and added then, as coming down a step or two to meet his low capacity,
‘Where was you rose?’

Tom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick
with sufficient unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage.
Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put
in a word.

‘Or possibly,’ said the man with the camp-stool, ‘the gentleman’s second
may feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at
an early period of this meeting; if so, I shall be happy to give him
satisfaction immediately.’

“Ah!” said Milly, with her pretty head inclining thoughtfully on one
side, as she looked down, following her busy fingers with her eyes.
“Even on me—and I am very different from you, Mr. Edmund, for I have no
learning, and don’t know how to think properly—this view of such things
has made a great impression, since you have been lying ill. When I have
seen you so touched by the kindness and attention of the poor people down
stairs, I have felt that you thought even that experience some repayment
for the loss of health, and I have read in your face, as plain as if it
was a book, that but for some trouble and sorrow we should never know
half the good there is about us.”

FOOTNOTES:

‘Snores deep?’ repeated Jonas. ‘Yes; let him alone for that. He’ll snore
for six, at any time.’

‘You know he meant all along to carry off that one!’ said Dennis,
indicating Dolly by the slightest possible jerk of his head:--‘And to
hand you over to somebody else.’

‘You were about to speak, young gentleman; what were you going to say?’

At any other time the Captain would have been overbalanced by such a
token of her affection and gratitude; but now, although he was very
sensible of it, he looked in her face with even more uneasiness than he
had testified before, and seemed unwilling to leave her.

Mr Sparkler had, undeniably, a weak appearance; with his eye in the
window like a knot in the glass, and no reason on earth for stopping his
bark suddenly, except the real reason.

“You seem to be sorry, Rosa.”

“And here I am,” he exclaimed, as he ended, “a cowardly scoundrel that
has not dared to die! Oh, Herbert! happy, happy, Herbert! Would I were
with you!”

He resumed his search, and in a moment more discovered the forged
receipt.  It was on the numbered and printed form, described by the Swiss
firm.  Vendale made a memorandum of the number and the date.  Having
replaced the receipt and locked up the iron chamber, he had leisure to
notice Obenreizer, reading the letter in the recess of a window at the
far end of the room.

‘Yes. Betwixt you and me, ma’am,’ returned Mr. Bumble, ‘that’s the
great principle; and that’s the reason why, if you look at any cases
that get into them owdacious newspapers, you’ll always observe that
sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese. That’s the
rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,’ said the
beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, ‘these are official secrets,
ma’am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the
porochial officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma’am,
that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port
wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no
sediment!’

There used, in that week, to come backward and forward to our lodging
to fence with Richard a person who had formerly been a cavalry
soldier; he was a fine bluff-looking man, of a frank free bearing,
with whom Richard had practised for some months. I heard so much
about him, not only from Richard, but from my guardian too, that I
was purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast
when he came.

To this, affecting modest reserve and diffidence, he made no answer,
but turned away his head.

“On your business, my dear,” replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his
companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. “On your business all
night.”

This may appear a long story, but its conclusion invests it with a
degree of interest which warrants the detail. The running away to sea
of a young man, and his return after a lapse of years, is, and ever has
been, no novelty in this island. This is not the burden of the tale. It
possessed an awful interest to those whom it immediately concerned, and
cannot fail to have some for the most indifferent reader.

‘Obliged?’

By desire of his hospitable master, Mr. Jukes invited the other couples
and their friends to take refreshments at his house, which, as they
delightedly availed themselves of the offer, were served to them in the
summer-house overlooking the river; where, while enjoying themselves,
they did not forget to drink long life and happiness to Randulph and his
bride.

She stood by the table so perfectly composed and still after this
acknowledgment of his remark that Mr Meagles stared at her under a sort
of fascination, and could not even look to Clennam to make another move.
After waiting, awkwardly enough, for some moments, Arthur said:

He touched the younger woman I have mentioned on the shoulder, and
Martha stood before me.

[Sidenote: Mr. Charles Dickens.]

‘Mr. Bounderby,’ said Jem, turning with a smile to Louisa, ‘is a noble
animal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in
which a conventional hack like myself works.’

"The widow began to think it was high time to cry, so she took out her
handkerchief, and inquired whether Tom wished to insult her; whether
he thought it like a gentleman to take away the character of another
gentleman behind his back; why, if he had got anything to say, he
didn't say it to the man, like a man, instead of terrifying a poor weak
woman in that way; and so forth.

“Tell it then, if you please,” returned the other, “to yourself. You
can’t repeat it too often, as a lesson to you to avoid the subject in
speaking to me. I know no Harriet Carker. There is no such person. You
may have a sister; make much of her. I have none.”

“Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,” replied Mrs.
Maylie.

‘Much!’ said Steerforth. ‘Much more than for any other. Here is Daisy,
too, loves music from his soul. Sing us an Irish song, Rosa! and let me
sit and listen as I used to do.’

"I don't know."

Most unexpected, the mystery came out one day at Egham races. The public
was shy of bein pulled in, and Chops was ringin his little bell out of
his drawin-room winder, and was snarlin to me over his shoulder as he
kneeled down with his legs out at the back door,--for he couldn’t be
shoved into his house without kneeling down, and the premises wouldn’t
accommodate his legs,--was snarlin: “Here’s a precious public for you;
why the devil don’t they tumble up?” when a man in the crowd holds up a
carrier-pigeon and cries out: “If there’s any person here as has got a
ticket, the Lottery’s just drawd, and the number as has come up for the
great prize is three, seven, forty-two! Three, seven, forty-two!” I was
givin the man to the furies myself, for calling of the public’s
attention,--for the public will turn away, at any time, to look at
anything in preference to the thing showed ’em; and if you doubt it, get
’em together for any individual purpose on the face of the earth, and
send only two people in late and see if the whole company ain’t far more
interested in taking particular notice of them two than you,--I say I
wasn’t best pleased with the man for callin out, wasn’t blessin him in
my own mind, when I see Chops’s little bell fly out of the winder at a
old lady, and he gets up and kicks his box over, exposin the whole
secret, and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to me:
“Carry me into the wan, Toby, and throw a pail of water over me, or I’m
a dead man, for I’m come into my property!”

‘You must be very gentle with him, if you please,’ said Kit, ‘or you’ll
find him troublesome.  You’d better not keep on pulling his ears,
please.  I know he won’t like it.’

"An excellent preventative against fermentation certainly," said the
captain half smiling. "But you answer the doctor like a fool."

CHAPTER XII

They laid him by the side of her whom he had loved so well; and, in the
church where they had often prayed and mused and lingered hand in hand,
the child and the old man slept together.

"It's not a stick, it's a sword," said Robin.

Now, it was quite impossible for Lord John to think of retrenchment.
Among the absolute necessaries of life he reckoned at least two pair of
primrose kid gloves a-day, at three shillings a-pair. Two guineas a-week
for gloves,--the price of a moderate bachelor's lodging! Life would be
intolerable without such things; so, in order that he might continue in
the land of the living, his fastidious lordship had deigned to smile
upon Miss Sophy Miggins, and had permitted the idea of marriage with a
plebeian to enter his aristocratic mind.

‘I didn’t go for to do it, my love,’ said Trotty, hastily repairing this
mistake.  ‘Meg, my dear?’

We transported the shell-fish, or the "relish" as Mr. Peggotty had
modestly called it, up into our room unobserved, and made a great supper
that evening. But Traddles couldn't get happily out of it. He was too
unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else. He was
taken ill in the night--quite prostrate he was--in consequence of Crab;
and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills, to an extent
which Demple (whose father was a doctor) said was enough to undermine a
horse's constitution, received a caning and six chapters of Greek
Testament for refusing to confess.

‘Words of purpose and meaning, as you will find,’ replied the other.
‘Lay them to heart.’

"They name ye before me,
      A knell to mine ear;
    A shudder comes o'er me.----"

THAT in the title page and preface to the said work, your Honourable sex
are described and classified as animals; and although your Dedicator is
not at present prepared to deny that you _are_ animals, still he humbly
submits that it is not polite to call you so.

“Ah I my poor little girl!” said Woodruffe. “Give my love to her, and
tell her it will be a happy day when we can send for her to come home
again. Be sure you observe particularly, to tell us how she looks; and,
mind, if she fancies anything in the cart,--any radishes, or whatever
else, because it comes out of our garden, be sure you give it her. I
wish I was going myself with the cart, for the sake of seeing Becky; but
I must go to work. Here have I been all the while, waiting to see you
off. Ah! here they come! you may always have notice now of who is coming
by that child’s crying.”

Presently Joe said to me in a quiet kind of whisper.  "Hulks, Pip;
prison ships.  They're firing because one of the thieves on the hulks is
got away."

_Edgar Allan Poe_ (1809-1849)

"Agnes," said Uriah, either not regarding him, or not knowing what the
nature of his action was, "Agnes Wickfield is, I am safe to say, the
divinest of her sex. May I speak out, among friends? To be her father is
a proud distinction, but to be her usband--"

So, pursuing the one course of thought, he had the one relentless
monster still before him. All things looked black, and cold, and deadly
upon him, and he on them. He found a likeness to his misfortune
everywhere. There was a remorseless triumph going on about him, and it
galled and stung him in his pride and jealousy, whatever form it took:
though most of all when it divided with him the love and memory of his
lost boy.

‘That she ain’t!’ said Mrs Gamp; ‘nor have I brought her, Mr Chuzzlewit.
I’ve brought another, which engages to give every satigefaction.’

"But a man in any station can do his duty," said the young Captain, "and,
in doing it, can earn his own respect, even if his case should be so very
unfortunate and so very rare that he can earn no other man's.  A common
soldier, poor brute though you called him just now, has this advantage in
the stormy times we live in, that he always does his duty before a host
of sympathising witnesses.  Do you doubt that he may so do it as to be
extolled through a whole regiment, through a whole army, through a whole
country?  Turn while you may yet retrieve the past, and try."

‘I came here,’ said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley--‘’pon
my soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for.  It would
puzzle me to tell you, it would by Gad.  I wanted a little inspiration,
a little freshening up, a little change of ideas, and-- ‘Pon my soul
and honour,’ said the military gentleman, checking himself and looking
round the room, ‘what a devilish classical thing this is! by Gad, it’s
quite Minervian.’

So we advanced into this ghostly city, continuing to hold our course
through narrow streets and lanes, all filled and flowing with water.
Some of the corners where our way branched off, were so acute and narrow,
that it seemed impossible for the long slender boat to turn them; but the
rowers, with a low melodious cry of warning, sent it skimming on without
a pause.  Sometimes, the rowers of another black boat like our own,
echoed the cry, and slackening their speed (as I thought we did ours)
would come flitting past us like a dark shadow.  Other boats, of the same
sombre hue, were lying moored, I thought, to painted pillars, near to
dark mysterious doors that opened straight upon the water.  Some of these
were empty; in some, the rowers lay asleep; towards one, I saw some
figures coming down a gloomy archway from the interior of a palace: gaily
dressed, and attended by torch-bearers.  It was but a glimpse I had of
them; for a bridge, so low and close upon the boat that it seemed ready
to fall down and crush us: one of the many bridges that perplexed the
Dream: blotted them out, instantly.  On we went, floating towards the
heart of this strange place—with water all about us where never water was
elsewhere—clusters of houses, churches, heaps of stately buildings
growing out of it—and, everywhere, the same extraordinary silence.
Presently, we shot across a broad and open stream; and passing, as I
thought, before a spacious paved quay, where the bright lamps with which
it was illuminated showed long rows of arches and pillars, of ponderous
construction and great strength, but as light to the eye as garlands of
hoarfrost or gossamer—and where, for the first time, I saw people
walking—arrived at a flight of steps leading from the water to a large
mansion, where, having passed through corridors and galleries
innumerable, I lay down to rest; listening to the black boats stealing up
and down below the window on the rippling water, till I fell asleep.

"What _do_ you advise?"

“You are right. Of course. Make the correction.”

His father coming and bending down to him—which he did quickly, and
without first pausing by the bedside—Paul held him round the neck, and
repeated those words to him several times, and very earnestly; and Paul
never saw him in his room again at any time, whether it were day or
night, but he called out, “Don’t be sorry for me! Indeed I am quite
happy!” This was the beginning of his always saying in the morning that
he was a great deal better, and that they were to tell his father so.

‘Try a little something green,’ said Young John, handing him the basket.

‘Oh dear, Mrs. Kenwigs,’ said Miss Petowker, ‘while Mr. Noggs is making
that punch to drink happy returns in, do let Morleena go through that
figure dance before Mr. Lillyvick.’

This groom is the pilot-fish before the nobler shark. Next evening,
down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue, and
down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass.
Thenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men
with no names, who fly about all those particular parts of the
country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an
auriferous and malty shower, but who are merely persons of a restless
disposition and never do anything anywhere.

At length, by a great effort, he detached himself from the subject
sufficiently to observe:

I asked if the brickmaker’s wife were ill, but Charley said no. It
was some one else. Some one in her cottage who had tramped down to
Saint Albans and was tramping he didn’t know where. A poor boy,
Charley said. No father, no mother, no any one. “Like as Tom might
have been, miss, if Emma and me had died after father,” said Charley,
her round eyes filling with tears.

"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!"

"I beg Mr. Craggs's pardon," said the client. "After all, my iron-headed
friends," he leaned forward in his chair, and dropped his voice a
little, "you don't know half my ruin yet."

He rises; she rises too. “Where,” she asks him, darkening her large
eyes until their drooping lids almost conceal them—and yet they
stare, “where is your false, your treacherous, and cursed wife?”

Having now none of those amusements which in former years had served
to employ his idle hours having lost his flies, given up his pigeons,
removed from Finchley, sold his house, and resigned his garden, he
devoted the whole of his leisure time to the society and improvement
of his son. As he could not bear to part with him, and was wholly
unable to make up his mind to send him to any great boarding-school,
he was partly educated at the same school at which his father had
been a pupil, and partly by masters who attended him at home. The
father appears to have bestowed great and praiseworthy care upon his
education. Although at this time he was only twelve years old, he had
not only quite mastered the common rudiments of learning, but had
become well acquainted with French literature, and wrote the language
with ease and propriety. He had at a very early age manifested a great
fondness for music, especially the violin, and had acquired great
proficiency on that instrument, under the tuition of one of the first
masters in the country.

“Has he followed us? You can look without seeming to. Is he behind?”

"Did it cry out?"

Ever faithfully yours.

CHAPTER XV-EARLY COACHES

‘Obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill, eh!’ repeated Mr Slyme,
after a sulky application to his glass. ‘Very pretty! And crowds of
impostors, the while, becoming famous; men who are no more on a level
with me than--Tigg, I take you to witness that I am the most persecuted
hound on the face of the earth.’

“Nothing bad, I hope?” said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a
startled look on his companion.

“My son!” said Mr. Turveydrop. “My children! I cannot resist your
prayer. Be happy!”

‘Very good. Tell my servant to bring me up some hot water at half-past
eight in the morning, and that I shall not want him any more to-night.’

“If you really suppose,” Rosa pleads with him, turning paler, “that I
favour Mr. Landless, or that Mr. Landless has ever in any way addressed
himself to me, you are wrong.”

[25] Anne, daughter of Sir W. Pulteney of Misterton, in the county of
Stafford; remarried to Philip Southcote, Esq. Died in 1746.

Mr Flintwinch lighted the candle briskly, and said as he put it down
upon the table:

[Sidenote: Mr. Charles Knight.]

"No."

CHAPTER XVIII.

Mrs. B. deliberately took it up, and appeared for a moment absorbed
in thought. "I have it!--I have it!" at length she exclaimed, as the
bewildered Richie stood staring at her abstraction.

‘Sir,’ said Mr Rugg, taking him by the hand, ‘you are a young man that
it does one good to come across. You are a young man that I should
like to put in the witness-box, to humanise the minds of the legal
profession. I hope you have brought your appetite with you, and intend
to play a good knife and fork?’

I will mention, in this place, two small changes that I made while
my sister and I were yet alone.  It occurring to me as not
improbable that Turk howled in the house at night, partly because
he wanted to get out of it, I stationed him in his kennel outside,
but unchained; and I seriously warned the village that any man who
came in his way must not expect to leave him without a rip in his
own throat.  I then casually asked Ikey if he were a judge of a
gun?  On his saying, "Yes, sir, I knows a good gun when I sees
her," I begged the favor of his stepping up to the house and
looking at mine.

The wretched object being much embarrassed by holding what remained
of his hat, Eugene airily tossed it to the door, and put him down in a
chair.

It was sad to see the child who had no name or lineage, watching the
other children as they played, not knowing how to talk with them, or
sport with them, and more strange to the ways of childhood than a rough
dog. It was sad, though in a different way, to see what an instinctive
knowledge the youngest children there had of his being different from all
the rest, and how they made timid approaches to him with soft words and
touches, and with little presents, that he might not be unhappy. But he
kept by Milly, and began to love her—that was another, as she said!—and,
as they all liked her dearly, they were glad of that, and when they saw
him peeping at them from behind her chair, they were pleased that he was
so close to it.

Our poor friend, the naval governor,[25] has lost his wife, I am sorry
to hear, since you and I spoke of his pleasant face. Do not let your
nieces forget me, if you can help it, and give my love to Count D'Orsay,
with many thanks to him for his charming letter. I was greatly amused by
his account of ----. There was a cold shade of aristocracy about it, and
a dampness of cold water, which entertained me beyond measure.

‘There is some unfortunate division between them,’ I replied. ‘Some
unhappy cause of separation. A secret. It may be inseparable from the
discrepancy in their years. It may have grown up out of almost nothing.’

‘Of that I am well assured,’ returned brother Charles, ‘well assured.
You will give me credit for thinking so, when I tell you that the object
of this mission is a young lady.’

The announcement of this event created a "sensation" at the foot of
Snow-hill; the Rubicon was past; the business _was_ to be disposed of;
and, that no time might be lost, Mr. Tweasle, without taking off his
gloves, began to scribble an advertisement, while Mrs. Tweasle waddled
into the shop and insulted a customer.

‘—His own deep way, in anything?’

_Little Dorrit._

‘Oh! I see,’ said the stranger, half aside, ‘negus too strong here--
liberal landlord--very foolish--very--lemonade much better--hot rooms--
elderly gentlemen--suffer for it in the morning--cruel--cruel;’ and he
moved on a step or two.

“We must put it to the vote,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “who may he be?”

"Yes, certainly," replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the water from his
head and face, and gasping for breath. "I fell upon my back. I couldn't
get on my feet at first."

CHAPTER XVII.   SHOWING THAT AN ATTACK OF RHEUMATISM

“Thank you, Ma’am,” said the steward hastily. “I can’t stop--I’m in a
hurry home, where I wanted to leave this brat to-night; but he _would_
follow me. Come, Billy; come this minute, you young rogue.”

The discovery turned me over, because I knew that a part of that
establishment where she had been was allotted to young men (some of them
well off), and I thought to myself, "If she favours him, where am I? and
where is all that I have worked and planned for?"  Hoping--I must confess
to the selfishness--that she might _not_ favour him, I set myself to find
out.  At last I was by accident present at a meeting between them in the
open air, looking on leaning behind a fir-tree without their knowing of
it.  It was a moving meeting for all the three parties concerned.  I knew
every syllable that passed between them as well as they did.  I listened
with my eyes, which had come to be as quick and true with deaf and dumb
conversation as my ears with the talk of people that can speak.  He was a-
going out to China as clerk in a merchant's house, which his father had
been before him.  He was in circumstances to keep a wife, and he wanted
her to marry him and go along with him.  She persisted, no.  He asked if
she didn't love him.  Yes, she loved him dearly, dearly; but she could
never disappoint her beloved, good, noble, generous, and I-don't-know-
what-all father (meaning me, the Cheap Jack in the sleeved waistcoat) and
she would stay with him, Heaven bless him! though it was to break her
heart.  Then she cried most bitterly, and that made up my mind.

Well, my darling, almost weary
Of my story?  Wait awhile;
For the rest is only joyful;
I can tell it with a smile.
One bright promise still was left me,
Wound so close about my soul,
That, as one by one had failed me,
This dream now absorbed the whole.

“You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest
creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,” said Mrs.
Maylie, embracing her tenderly. “Come, come, my love, remember who this
is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here—look, look,
my dear!”

Nearly three hours of silence passed away. Kate blushed to find, when
Nicholas returned, how long she had been sitting alone, occupied with
her own thoughts.

"Hush! Don't speak lightly of a true heart, which is all your own,
Marion," cried her sister, "even in jest. There is not a truer heart
than Alfred's in the world!"

“You don’t object to him, little woman?”

There was a Fair besides.  The double persuasion being irresistible, and
my sponge being left behind at the last Hotel, I made the tour of the
little town to buy another.  In the small sunny shops—mercers, opticians,
and druggist-grocers, with here and there an emporium of religious
images—the gravest of old spectacled Flemish husbands and wives sat
contemplating one another across bare counters, while the wasps, who
seemed to have taken military possession of the town, and to have placed
it under wasp-martial law, executed warlike manœuvres in the windows.
Other shops the wasps had entirely to themselves, and nobody cared and
nobody came when I beat with a five-franc piece upon the board of custom.
What I sought was no more to be found than if I had sought a nugget of
Californian gold: so I went, spongeless, to pass the evening with the
Family P. Salcy.

Mr. Dolloby--Dolloby was the name over the shop door, at least--took the
waistcoat, stood his pipe on its head, against the door-post, went into
the shop, followed by me, snuffed the two candles with his fingers,
spread the waistcoat on the counter, and looked at it there, held it up
against the light, and looked at it there, and ultimately said:

“In the meantime,” said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully, “as Miss Summerson,
with her practical good sense, observes, he is getting worse.
Therefore I recommend your turning him out before he gets still
worse.”

Our "business" here is _very bad_, though at Belfast it is enormous.
There is no doubt that great alarm prevails here. This hotel is
constantly filling and emptying as families leave the country, and set
in a current to the steamers. There is apprehension of some disturbance
between to-morrow night and Monday night (both inclusive), and I learn
this morning that all the drinking-shops are to be closed from to-night
until Tuesday. It is rumoured here that the Liverpool people are very
uneasy about some apprehended disturbance there at the same time. Very
likely you will know more about this than I do, and very likely it may
be nothing. There is no doubt whatever that alarm prevails, and the
manager of this hotel, an intelligent German, is very gloomy on the
subject. On the other hand, there is feasting going on, and I have been
asked to dinner-parties by divers civil and military authorities.

‘It was a famous device in the beginning,’ replied Lord George; ‘an
excellent device, and did good service in Scotland. It was quite worthy
of you. You remind me not to be a sluggard, Gashford, when the vineyard
is menaced with destruction, and may be trodden down by Papist feet. Let
the horses be saddled in half-an-hour. We must be up and doing!’

As he spoke he resumed his walk, and hurried round the court as before.
When he came again to where she stood, he stopped, and said,

He stooped a good deal, and plodded along in a slow pre-occupied manner,
which made the bustling London thoroughfares no very safe resort for
him. He was dirtily and meanly dressed, in a threadbare coat, once blue,
reaching to his ankles and buttoned to his chin, where it vanished in
the pale ghost of a velvet collar. A piece of red cloth with which that
phantom had been stiffened in its lifetime was now laid bare, and poked
itself up, at the back of the old man’s neck, into a confusion of grey
hair and rusty stock and buckle which altogether nearly poked his
hat off. A greasy hat it was, and a napless; impending over his eyes,
cracked and crumpled at the brim, and with a wisp of pocket-handkerchief
dangling out below it. His trousers were so long and loose, and his
shoes so clumsy and large, that he shuffled like an elephant; though how
much of this was gait, and how much trailing cloth and leather, no one
could have told. Under one arm he carried a limp and worn-out case,
containing some wind instrument; in the same hand he had a pennyworth
of snuff in a little packet of whitey-brown paper, from which he slowly
comforted his poor blue old nose with a lengthened-out pinch, as Arthur
Clennam looked at him.

GRIDE--Chap. li.]

"_Do_ be quiet!" cried the authoritative voice, and the would-be
naturalist shrank into his shell like a snail in the "Sohological
Gardens."

‘I say,’ repeated Ralph, tartly, ‘let him get that situation, and his
fortune is made. If he don’t like that, let him get one for himself.
Without friends, money, recommendation, or knowledge of business of any
kind, let him find honest employment in London, which will keep him in
shoe leather, and I’ll give him a thousand pounds. At least,’ said Mr
Ralph Nickleby, checking himself, ‘I would if I had it.’

MY DEAR SHIRLEY BROOKS,

A week hence and Simon Deg was the son-in-law of Mr. Spires. Though Mr.
Spires had misunderstood Simon, and Simon had borne the aspect of
opposition to his old friend in defence of conscientious principle, the
wife and daughter of the manufacturer had always understood him, and
secretly looked forward to some day of recognition and re-union.

"He's a ill-conditioned, vicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,"
said Mr. Bumble angrily. "Where is he?"

‘It’s the best thing altogether, that I ever heard of, I think,’ said Mr
Crummles; and then Mr. Crummles, Mrs. Crummles, and Master Percy Crummles,
all fell to laughing violently. Nicholas left them to enjoy their mirth
together, and walked to his lodgings; wondering very much what mystery
connected with Miss Petowker could provoke such merriment, and pondering
still more on the extreme surprise with which that lady would regard his
sudden enlistment in a profession of which she was such a distinguished
and brilliant ornament.

The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a
moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve, whereupon the
last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.

She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times,
and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter
without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking
in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room
in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken
some new cause of alarm.

No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession,
     Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it
       goes,
     Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and
       bland in the parlours,
     In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,
     Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bed-room,
       everywhere,
     Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the
       breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,
     Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial
       flowers,
     Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself.
     Speaking of anything else, but never of itself.

“Cost!” repeated Mrs Brown.

I confess to small faith in any American profits having international
copyright for their aim. But I will carefully consider Blackwood's
letter (when I get it) and will call upon you and tell you what occurs
to me in reference to it, before I communicate with that northern light.

Mr. Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion.

"What's the fun?" said a rather tall thin young man, in a green coat,
emerging suddenly from the coach-yard.

MR. CHEERLY--Blue coat, cord breeches, and gaiters.

It was the eleventh of May, when the five members were carried in state
and triumph to Westminster. They were taken by water. The river could
not be seen for the boats on it; and the five members were hemmed in by
barges full of men and great guns, ready to protect them, at any cost.
Along the Strand a large body of the train-bands of London, under their
commander, Skippon, marched to be ready to assist the little fleet.
Beyond them, came a crowd who choked the streets, roaring incessantly
about the Bishops and the Papists, and crying out contemptuously as
they passed Whitehall, ‘What has become of the King?’ With this great
noise outside the House of Commons, and with great silence within, Mr.
Pym rose and informed the House of the great kindness with which they
had been received in the City. Upon that, the House called the sheriffs
in and thanked them, and requested the train-bands, under their
commander Skippon, to guard the House of Commons every day. Then, came
four thousand men on horseback out of Buckinghamshire, offering their
services as a guard too, and bearing a petition to the King,
complaining of the injury that had been done to Mr. Hampden, who was
their county man and much beloved and honoured.

LITTLE NELL AND HER GRANDFATHER AT MRS. JARLEY'S

On the Thursday, both Houses had adjourned until the following Monday
se’nnight, declaring it impossible to pursue their deliberations with
the necessary gravity and freedom, while they were surrounded by armed
troops. And now that the rioters were dispersed, the citizens were beset
with a new fear; for, finding the public thoroughfares and all their
usual places of resort filled with soldiers entrusted with the free use
of fire and sword, they began to lend a greedy ear to the rumours which
were afloat of martial law being declared, and to dismal stories of
prisoners having been seen hanging on lamp-posts in Cheapside and
Fleet Street. These terrors being promptly dispelled by a Proclamation
declaring that all the rioters in custody would be tried by a special
commission in due course of law, a fresh alarm was engendered by its
being whispered abroad that French money had been found on some of the
rioters, and that the disturbances had been fomented by foreign powers
who sought to compass the overthrow and ruin of England. This report,
which was strengthened by the diffusion of anonymous handbills, but
which, if it had any foundation at all, probably owed its origin to the
circumstance of some few coins which were not English money having been
swept into the pockets of the insurgents with other miscellaneous booty,
and afterwards discovered on the prisoners or the dead bodies,--caused
a great sensation; and men’s minds being in that excited state when they
are most apt to catch at any shadow of apprehension, was bruited about
with much industry.

"Many, many, many, happy returns," said the Old Soldier. "Not only for
your own sake, but for Annie's, and John Maldon's, and many other
peoples'. It seems but yesterday to me, John, when you were a little
creature, a head shorter than Master Copperfield, making baby love to
Annie behind the gooseberry bushes in the back-garden."

Without strong affection and humanity of
        heart and gratitude to that
      Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great
    attribute is Benevolence to all things
                 that breathe,
      happiness can never be attained.

‘If you ask me Why,’ said Mr Meagles, a little disturbed by the
question, for he was far more intent on softening her case than the
family’s, ‘I can only refer you to what I have just repeated as having
been pretty near my words to Mother. As to How, we had said Good night
to Pet in her presence (very affectionately, I must allow), and she
had attended Pet up-stairs--you remember she was her maid. Perhaps Pet,
having been out of sorts, may have been a little more inconsiderate than
usual in requiring services of her: but I don’t know that I have any
right to say so; she was always thoughtful and gentle.’

In my ignorance of the subject, I am bound to say that it may be, for
anything I know, indeed I am ready to admit that it _is_, exceedingly
important that a clay farm should go for a number of years to waste; but
I claim some knowledge as to the management of a clay farmer, and I
positively object to his ever lying fallow.  In the hope that this very
rich and teeming individual may speedily be ploughed up, and that, we
shall gather into our barns and store-houses the admirable crop of
wisdom, which must spring up when ever he is sown, I take leave to
propose his health, begging to assure him that the kind manner in which
he offered to me your very valuable present, I can never forget.

“My love!” cried her mother. “The idea of the thing. The--”

‘Now, Ma,’ said Bella, reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a
blush, ‘you and Lavvy think magnificent me fit for nothing, but I intend
to prove the contrary. I mean to be Cook today.’

"Mary," said the Blind Girl, "tell me what my home is. What it truly
is."

"I am sorry for it, too," said my aunt, rubbing her nose. "I have had no
peace of mind, Trot, since I have been here."

‘You nasty, idle, vicious, good-for-nothing brute,’ cried the woman,
stamping on the ground, ‘why don’t you turn the mangle?’

Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the
moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,
with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her
face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.

‘Yes,’ said the physician, ‘yes, you are both right. But I may as well
tell you that I can find nothing the matter with Mr Merdle. He has
the constitution of a rhinoceros, the digestion of an ostrich, and
the concentration of an oyster. As to nerves, Mr Merdle is of a cool
temperament, and not a sensitive man: is about as invulnerable, I should
say, as Achilles. How such a man should suppose himself unwell without
reason, you may think strange. But I have found nothing the matter with
him. He may have some deep-seated recondite complaint. I can’t say. I
only say, that at present I have not found it out.’

“That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I noticed, at a
carriage window on my side, what looked like a confusion of hands and
heads, and something waved.  I saw it, just in time to signal the driver,
Stop!  He shut off, and put his brake on, but the train drifted past here
a hundred and fifty yards or more.  I ran after it, and, as I went along,
heard terrible screams and cries.  A beautiful young lady had died
instantaneously in one of the compartments, and was brought in here, and
laid down on this floor between us.”

‘Oh!  _His_ name is Mr. Battens,’ said the tidy woman, dropping her
voice.

‘That stone has worn away and been replaced by others, and many
generations have come and gone since then. Time has softened down the
colours, but the same stream of light still falls upon the forgotten
tomb, of which no trace remains; and, to this day, the stranger is shown
in York Cathedral, an old window called the Five Sisters.’

I could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried, and made the subject
of such a wish. I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken. That
Peggotty was the best, the truest, the most faithful, most devoted, and
most self-denying friend and servant in the world; who had ever loved me
dearly, who had ever loved my mother dearly; who had held my mother's
dying head upon her arm, on whose face my mother had imprinted her last
grateful kiss. And my remembrance of them both, choking me, I broke down
as I was trying to say that her home was my home, and that all she had
was mine, and that I would have gone to her for shelter, but for her
humble station, which made me fear that I might bring some trouble on
her--I broke down, I say, as I was trying to say so, and laid my face in
my hands upon the table.

OLIVER'S FIRST MEETING WITH THE ARTFUL DODGER

The neighbour nodded assent.

"I think--shall I be quite plain, Agnes, liking him so much?"

‘That’s quite true, Madame Mantalini,’ said Miss Knag, with whom her
late employer had secretly come to an amicable understanding on this
point. ‘Very true, indeed, Madame Mantalini--hem--very true. And I never
was more glad in all my life, that I had strength of mind to resist
matrimonial offers, no matter how advantageous, than I am when I think
of my present position as compared with your most unfortunate and most
undeserved one, Madame Mantalini.’

‘How should I know, my dear?’ replied the Jew, looking round as
he plied the bellows. ‘About his losses, maybe; or the little
retirement in the country that he’s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that
it, my dear?’

Mr Brass slyly tickles his nose with his pen, and looks at Kit with the
water standing in his eyes.  Kit thinks that if ever there was a good
man who belied his appearance, that man is Sampson Brass.

‘Not even half-a-crown, perhaps?’ urged Mr Tigg.

‘Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?’ I inquired, provisionally.

The Marchioness jumped up quickly and clapped her hands.  ‘Arabian
Night, certainly,’ thought Mr Swiveller; ‘they always clap their hands
instead of ringing the bell.  Now for the two thousand black slaves,
with jars of jewels on their heads!’

‘The dread of this hour,’ returned the widow, ‘has been upon me all my
life, and I will not. Evil will fall upon him, if you stand eye to eye.
My blighted boy! Oh! all good angels who know the truth--hear a poor
mother’s prayer, and spare my boy from knowledge of this man!’

I use the portfolio[46] for managerial papers still. That's something.

She holds up a common cash-bag, and on the table is a heap of such bags.
Witch Two laughs at us.  Witch Three scowls at us.  Witch sisterhood all,

like the beginning of the development of a perverted diabolical halo, and
that when it spreads all round her head, she will die in the odour of
devilry.

Let there be union among us.

"Bless your considerate heart!" said the housemaid.

“Suppose we tell them to wait awhile longer, as the young ladies are
going to travel. We might as well see the world first, and marry in a
year or two. But still,” added she, after a pause, “I could not find it
in my heart to say so to Thomas; and I promised him to speak to-day.”

“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”

‘Take hold of my leg; and, when I say “Over,” raise me gently.’

The one dated March 9th alludes to short papers written for "Master
Humphrey's Clock" prior to the commencement of "The Old Curiosity Shop."

When the evening had set in, she heard, from the room in which she sat
on purpose, a footstep on the stairs that she thought to be Edith’s.
Hurrying out, and up towards her room, Florence met her immediately,
coming down alone.

I could eat nothing and could not sleep, and I grew so nervous under
those delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an
unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk. Yielding to my
companion’s better sense, however, I remained where I was. All this
time, kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was
engaged, he was up and down at every house we came to, addressing
people whom he had never beheld before as old acquaintances, running
in to warm himself at every fire he saw, talking and drinking and
shaking hands at every bar and tap, friendly with every waggoner,
wheelwright, blacksmith, and toll-taker, yet never seeming to lose
time, and always mounting to the box again with his watchful, steady
face and his business-like “Get on, my lad!”

It was a troublesome matter to adjust Mrs Gamp’s luggage to her
satisfaction; for every package belonging to that lady had the
inconvenient property of requiring to be put in a boot by itself, and
to have no other luggage near it, on pain of actions at law for heavy
damages against the proprietors of the coach. The umbrella with the
circular patch was particularly hard to be got rid of, and several times
thrust out its battered brass nozzle from improper crevices and chinks,
to the great terror of the other passengers. Indeed, in her intense
anxiety to find a haven of refuge for this chattel, Mrs Gamp so often
moved it, in the course of five minutes, that it seemed not one umbrella
but fifty. At length it was lost, or said to be; and for the next five
minutes she was face to face with the coachman, go wherever he might,
protesting that it should be ‘made good,’ though she took the question
to the House of Commons.

“Did you speak?”

Mr Haredale threw himself from his horse, but he had no need to knock
at the door, for it was already open, and there stood upon the step
a portly old man, with a very red, or rather purple face, who with an
anxious expression of countenance, was remonstrating with some unseen
personage upstairs, while the porter essayed to close the door by
degrees and get rid of him. With the intense impatience and excitement
natural to one in his condition, Mr Haredale thrust himself forward and
was about to speak, when the fat old gentleman interposed:

‘How do you feel now, my love?’ inquired Miss Snevellicci.

"Yes! From him," she said with a laugh. "If she is not found, perhaps
she never will be found. She may be dead!"

1843 TO 1857.

“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “I
don’t think anything about it.”

GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER, KENT,
                                     _Sunday Morning, May 15th, 1864._

We said no more as we approached the light, but made softly for the
door. I laid my hand upon the latch; and whispering Steerforth to keep
close to me, went in.

These ruminations might or might not have reached Mark Tapley; for
though they were by no means addressed to him, yet they were softly
uttered. In any case, he stood there, watching Martin with an
indescribable and most involved expression on his visage, until that
young man roused himself and looked towards him; when he turned away,
as being suddenly intent upon certain preparations for the journey,
and, without giving vent to any articulate sound, smiled with surpassing
ghastliness, and seemed by a twist of his features and a motion of his
lips, to release himself of this word:

‘Let it rest with Rose, then,’ interposed Harry. ‘You will not
press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any
obstacle in my way?’

My ear has gradually become so accustomed to French, that I understand
the people at the theatres (for the first time) with perfect ease and
satisfaction. I walked about with Regnier for an hour and a half
yesterday, and received many compliments on my angelic manner of
speaking the celestial language. There is a winter Franconi's now, high
up on the Boulevards, just like the round theatre on the Champs Elysées,
and as bright and beautiful. A clown from Astley's is all in high favour
there at present. He talks slang English (being evidently an idiot), as
if he felt a perfect confidence that everybody understands him. His
name is Boswell, and the whole cirque rang last night with cries for Boz
Zwilllll! Boz Zweellll! Boz Zwuallll! etc. etc. etc. etc.

‘What mean you?’ rejoined Mrs. Crummles, in her most popular manner.
‘Whence comes this altered tone?’

The gentleman pointed to a couple of chairs, and intimated by an
emphatic nod of his head that he expected them to be seated.  Messrs
Codlin and Short, after looking at each other with considerable doubt
and indecision, at length sat down--each on the extreme edge of the
chair pointed out to him--and held their hats very tight, while the
single gentleman filled a couple of glasses from a bottle on the table
beside him, and presented them in due form.

It was new and strange to him to have himself presented to himself so
clearly, in a glass of her holding up. He had always patronised her, in
his superiority to her share of woman’s wit. Was that but another
instance of something radically amiss in the terms on which they had
been gliding towards a life-long bondage?

The sun was setting when they reached the wicket-gate at which the path
began, and, as the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike, it shed
its warm tint even upon the resting-places of the dead, and bade them
be of good hope for its rising on the morrow.  The church was old and
grey, with ivy clinging to the walls, and round the porch.  Shunning
the tombs, it crept about the mounds, beneath which slept poor humble
men: twining for them the first wreaths they had ever won, but wreaths
less liable to wither and far more lasting in their kind, than some
which were graven deep in stone and marble, and told in pompous terms
of virtues meekly hidden for many a year, and only revealed at last to
executors and mourning legatees.

Nobody would have thought so, to see her sitting upright, with her arms
folded; but she had wonderful self-command.

‘I don’t say, you know,’ Mr Boffin stipulated, ‘but what it may be more
than enough. And I’ll tell you why, Rokesmith. A man of property, like
me, is bound to consider the market-price. At first I didn’t enter into
that as much as I might have done; but I’ve got acquainted with other
men of property since, and I’ve got acquainted with the duties of
property. I mustn’t go putting the market-price up, because money may
happen not to be an object with me. A sheep is worth so much in the
market, and I ought to give it and no more. A secretary is worth so much
in the market, and I ought to give it and no more. However, I don’t mind
stretching a point with you.’

‘Where were you going now?’ I asked.

("I wish you were, with all my heart--and in your native country!" said
my aunt).

"Send for my sister.  My feet are so cold.  Lift me up?"

“Oh, Mr. Bumble!” remonstrated Mrs. Corney.

“You cannot see him, my poor dear?”

Very dark, and the sea most brilliantly phosphorescent.  Great way on the
ship, and double look-out kept.  Vigilant captain on the bridge, vigilant
first officer looking over the port side, vigilant second officer
standing by the quarter-master at the compass, vigilant third officer
posted at the stern rail with a lantern.  No passengers on the quiet
decks, but expectation everywhere nevertheless.  The two men at the wheel
very steady, very serious, and very prompt to answer orders.  An order
issued sharply now and then, and echoed back; otherwise the night drags
slowly, silently, with no change.

“Ah! Heaven help me and forgive me!” she returned, nodding her head at
the fire. “If man would help some of us a little more, God would
forgive us all the sooner perhaps.”

‘Where?’ rejoined Kit, looking round.

‘Go thy ways, Sim, go thy ways,’ said the locksmith, as soon as he could
speak. ‘I have done my best for thee, poor lad, and would have saved
thee, but the rope is round thy neck, I fear.’

“I saw him in the street, when I was out just now. He looked at me, and
stood near me. I am afraid of him.”

‘Is it possible,’ said Emma, with some indignation, ‘that you who have
seen these men committing the outrages you have told us of, and who have
fallen into their hands, like us, can exult in their cruelties!’

The Secretary felt that there was no gainsaying what was urged by
this brave old heroine, and he presently repaired to Mrs Boffin and
recommended her to let Betty Higden have her way, at all events for the
time. ‘It would be far more satisfactory to your kind heart, I know,’
he said, ‘to provide for her, but it may be a duty to respect this
independent spirit.’ Mrs Boffin was not proof against the consideration
set before her. She and her husband had worked too, and had brought
their simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps. If they owed a
duty to Betty Higden, of a surety that duty must be done.

‘And Dora,’ said Miss Mills, ‘YOU are dull.’

It matters little now.  Coaches of all colours are alike to poor
Kindheart, and he rests far North of the little cemetery with the
cypress-trees, by the city walls where the Mediterranean is so beautiful.

It may easily be conceived with what inveteracy she declaimed against
weddings of every kind, and how bitterly she abused the whole godless,
light-minded male sex, (for her quarrel was with the whole sex,) and
with what transcendent venom she inveighed against the coquettish minxes
who had the impudence to think of a man before they were out of their
leading-strings; though these same minxes in leading-strings were all
the while walking about in shoes such as are generally manufactured for
damsels about to bid adieu to their teens.

“You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the
money. “There are only the usual odours.”

“No, Mrs Dombey,” he resumed. “No, Madam. There is no possibility of
separation between you and me, and therefore I the more advise you to
be awakened to a sense of duty. And, Carker, as I was about to say to
you—”

He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had
been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his
capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair
hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into
knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh
crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight—nine—then. If it was
not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on
each other’s heels, where would he be, when they came round again!
Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had
ceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own
funeral train; at eleven—

She bowed her veiled head lower and lower; perhaps under the veil
her lips kissed the lips of the dead.  Then she said whisperingly:

‘The paper might be worth, to me, a sum of money. I cannot say how much,
or how little.’

Nicholas looked over in the corner where the boy usually slept, but it
was vacant; so he made no answer.

Chapter 79

Mr. Fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no
mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with
a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he
should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen
an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by
acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his
operations; blending truth and fiction together as best served his
purpose, and bringing both to bear with so much art, that Mr. Bolter’s
respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with
a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.

THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP

He was yet on his way to the White Hart, when two plump gentleman and
one thin one entered the yard, and looked round in search of some
authorised person of whom they could make a few inquiries. Mr. Samuel
Weller happened to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of
painted tops, the personal property of a farmer who was refreshing
himself with a slight lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a
pot or two of porter, after the fatigues of the Borough market; and to
him the thin gentleman straightway advanced.

‘How did it happen?’

‘My own unnatural mother,’ screamed the young lady, ‘wants to annihilate
George! But you shan’t be annihilated, George. I’ll die first!’

Mr Meagles very hot indeed again.

‘What!’ exclaimed Sir Norfolk, almost shuddering at the inadvertence he
had committed; ‘a waiting-man in such costly and nitid attire. Why,
his master, the Pretonius Arbiter of the day, can scarcely be more
studiously refined in the taste and style of the vestments wherewith he
adorneth his person.’

“Did you hear me ask you where you have come from?”

He sat down. His mother drew a stool towards him, and sat at his feet.

‘Sir Bulkeley Price,’ returned Sir Norfolk, raising his crane neck to
its utmost height, ‘I pray you not to interfere between me and Mr. Crew,
otherwise----’

“It is hardly necessary to add that I thought from time to time of my
travelling-companion in the next room.  His image was almost continually
before me.  He had been dull and depressed all the evening, and when we
parted for the night there was a look in his eyes which I could not get
out of my memory.

‘You are very good, sir. You speak very earnestly to me. But I--but I
wish you had not watched me.’

The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse of his
mysterious visitor with the least danger of being seen himself, was by
creeping on to the bed, and peeping out from between the curtains on the
opposite side. To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted. Keeping the
curtains carefully closed with his hand, so that nothing more of him
could be seen than his face and nightcap, and putting on his spectacles,
he mustered up courage and looked out.

“Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?” said Rose, glancing from the other
gentleman to the one who had spoken.

As we sat under the willow-tree and ate the cherries (fair, for Alice
shared them out), we played at being ninety. Nettie complained that she
had a bone in her old back and it made her hobble, and Alice sang a song
in an old woman's way, but it was very pretty, and we were all merry. At
least I don't know about merry exactly, but all comfortable.

“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.
Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is
another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and
when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it’s not
in any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same. I
don’t wish it professionally spoken about.”

This was the landlord, in a Greek cap, and a dress half Greek and half
English.  As master of the ceremonies, he called all the figures, and
occasionally addressed himself parenthetically—after this manner.  When
he was very loud, I use capitals.

“There, Jack, you hear! You would be afraid of him, under similar
circumstances, wouldn’t you, Miss Landless?”

"Ah, I wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart
would be inclined to bestow upon them!" said the gratified Mrs. Bardell.

‘That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which
must accrue to the cause of science, from the production to which they
have just adverted--no less than from the unwearied researches of Samuel
Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., in Hornsey, Highgate, Brixton, and
Camberwell--they cannot but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable
benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of
that learned man into a wider field, from extending his travels, and,
consequently, enlarging his sphere of observation, to the advancement of
knowledge, and the diffusion of learning.

A third lady (with her arms folded) said she wished he had chosen any
other time for fetching Mrs Gamp, but it always happened so with HER.

‘And very good ones too, I believe, haven’t they?’ asked the married
lady.

CHAPTER XVIII-A PARLIAMENTARY SKETCH

He crossed abruptly to the opposite quarter of the scaffolding, and
was in an instant deeply engaged in listening to those whom the cow's
horn had attracted, and in prescribing for their real or fancied
ailments. Vain were all Marsh's efforts again to attract his notice;
it was evident that he studiously avoided him; and when, after an hour
or more spent in useless endeavour, he saw the object of his anxiety
seclude himself once more within his canvass screen, he rode slowly
and thoughtfully off the field.--What should he do? Was the man a mere
quack? an impostor? His name thus obtained!--that might be easily done.
But then, his secret griefs; the doctor's knowledge of them; their
cure: for he felt that his pains were gone, his healthful feelings
restored! True; Aldrovando, if that were his name, had disclaimed all
co-operation in his recovery: but he knew or, he announced it. Nay,
more; he had hinted that he was yet in jeopardy; that practices--and
the chord sounded strangely in unison with one that had before vibrated
within him--that practices were in operation against his life! It was
enough! He would keep tryst with the Conjuror, if conjuror he were;
and, at least, ascertain who and what he was, and how he had become
acquainted with his own person and secret afflictions.

The Major replied that it was hard in Cleopatra to require the world to
be all heart, and yet to appropriate to herself the hearts of all the
world; which obliged Cleopatra to remind him that flattery was
insupportable to her, and that if he had the boldness to address her in
that strain any more, she would positively send him home.

“Esther, my dearest,” she said, breaking silence, “Richard is never
so well and I am never so easy about him as when he is with Allan
Woodcourt. We have to thank you for that.”

This note brought Richard to us very soon, but it made little change
in him if any. We would fairly try, he said, who was right and who
was wrong—he would show us—we should see! He was animated and
glowing, as if Ada’s tenderness had gratified him; but I could only
hope, with a sigh, that the letter might have some stronger effect
upon his mind on re-perusal than it assuredly had then.

‘What is your profession, sir?’

Without a sign to show that he heard, Bradley walked out of the Lock
House. Catching up from the table a piece of bread, and taking his
Bargeman’s bundle under his arm, Riderhood immediately followed him.
Bradley turned towards London. Riderhood caught him up, and walked at
his side.

Not but what I have my animosities towards Dover.  I particularly detest
Dover for the self-complacency with which it goes to bed.  It always goes
to bed (when I am going to Calais) with a more brilliant display of lamp
and candle than any other town.  Mr. and Mrs. Birmingham, host and
hostess of the Lord Warden Hotel, are my much esteemed friends, but they
are too conceited about the comforts of that establishment when the Night
Mail is starting.  I know it is a good house to stay at, and I don’t want
the fact insisted upon in all its warm bright windows at such an hour.  I
know the Warden is a stationary edifice that never rolls or pitches, and
I object to its big outline seeming to insist upon that circumstance,
and, as it were, to come over me with it, when I am reeling on the deck
of the boat.  Beshrew the Warden likewise, for obstructing that corner,
and making the wind so angry as it rushes round.  Shall I not know that
it blows quite soon enough, without the officious Warden’s interference?

Though I found him far better than I expected, I can scarcely say
whether I hoped or feared most at first; because I was so much
occupied with gathering comforts about him, and helping him, that I
had not time to think about the future. It was a dreadful but
sufficient preparation, being told of his death; and then finding him
alive, I was ready to bear whatever might ensue without a murmur. I
was so grateful for seeing him once more, that I valued each hour as
it passed, and as I had too much reason to fear that I should very
soon have nothing left of happiness but what my reflections would
afford me, I endeavoured, by suppressing feelings that would have made
him miserable, and myself unfit to serve him, to lay up no store of
regret. He asked me if I was a good nurse. I told him that I had not
been much tried. He said he was sure he would be a good patient, for
he would do whatever I bade him till he was convalescent; and then he
knew he would grow very cross. I watched in vain for a cross word. All
his endeavour seemed to be to leave none but pleasing impressions on
my mind; and as he grew worse and suffered more, his smile was more
sweet, and his thanks more fervent, for everything that was done for
him.

"Oh! I don't know," said the jolly old gentleman; "all very natural, I
dare say--nothing unusual. Mr. Pickwick, some wine, sir?" Mr. Pickwick,
who had been deeply investigating the interior of the pigeon-pie,
readily assented.

The hand of St. Sepulchre's clock was pointed at the quarter to eight.
Fifteen minutes more, and the unhappy ones appointed to die were
expected to ascend that platform from which they were to sink into
eternity. The immense multitude extended far up Giltspur-street one
way, and almost reached to Ludgate-hill in the opposite direction.
In all the houses commanding a view of the gallows the windows were
crowded; the ledges without the parapets and roofs were in like manner
surmounted by numerous spectators.

With these words, the fat boy laid himself affectionately down by the
side of the cod-fish: and placing an oyster-barrel under his head for a
pillow, fell asleep instantaneously.

‘And you’ll remember what I have said?’

It is possible that poor Trotty’s faith in these very vague Old Times was
not entirely destroyed, for he felt vague enough at that moment.  One
thing, however, was plain to him, in the midst of his distress; to wit,
that however these gentlemen might differ in details, his misgivings of
that morning, and of many other mornings, were well founded.  ‘No, no.
We can’t go right or do right,’ thought Trotty in despair.  ‘There is no
good in us.  We are born bad!’

‘That’s the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to, Sir,’
replied Mr. Weller. ‘You rayther want somebody to look arter you, Sir,
when your judgment goes out a wisitin’.’

Florence answered “Yes.”

"The Little Em'ly."

Such was the morning, when an open carriage, in which were three
Pickwickians (Mr. Snodgrass having preferred to remain at home), Mr.
Wardle, and Mr. Trundle, with Sam Weller on the box beside the driver,
pulled up by a gate at the roadside, before which stood a tall, raw-
boned gamekeeper, and a half-booted, leather-legginged boy, each bearing
a bag of capacious dimensions, and accompanied by a brace of pointers.

‘Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?’ sneered
the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. ‘We’ll cure you of that, my
young master.’

"Hollo! here, my boy, come here!" said the Earl.

“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.

‘Do you, Mr Boffin? Much obliged to you, I’m sure. Is it your pleasure,
sir, that we decline and we fall?’ with a feint of taking up the book.

‘It’s so unsportsmanlike,’ reasoned Winkle.

Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.

[Sidenote: Mr. George Cattermole.]

‘If you are not shocked, are you not surprised, man?’ demanded the
Physician, warmly.

"Is it!" said my aunt.

‘Don’t desire to?’--returned the other, muffling himself as before.

“Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.
“Have you anything to ask _me_?”

He was a very good old fellow, in his familiar way; and having stirred
the vestry fire, he looked round the shelves of registers for a
particular volume. ‘Here you are, you see,’ he said, taking it down and
turning the leaves. ‘Here you’ll find yourself, as large as life. Amy,
daughter of William and Fanny Dorrit. Born, Marshalsea Prison, Parish of
St George. And we tell people that you have lived there, without so much
as a day’s or a night’s absence, ever since. Is it true?’

“To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for
richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish,
until death do them part.”

Nobody replied.

‘I won’t, father,’ cried Joe, smiting the table with his fist, so that
the jugs and glasses rung again; ‘these things are hard enough to bear
from you; from anybody else I never will endure them any more. Therefore
I say, Mr Cobb, don’t talk to me.’

CHAPTER XXIX. THE STORY OF THE GOBLINS WHO STOLE A SEXTON

So, on the sixteenth of December, one thousand six hundred and
fifty-three, a great procession was formed at Oliver’s door, and he
came out in a black velvet suit and a big pair of boots, and got into
his coach and went down to Westminster, attended by the judges, and the
lord mayor, and the aldermen, and all the other great and wonderful
personages of the country. There, in the Court of Chancery, he publicly
accepted the office of Lord Protector. Then he was sworn, and the City
sword was handed to him, and the seal was handed to him, and all the
other things were handed to him which are usually handed to Kings and
Queens on state occasions. When Oliver had handed them all back, he was
quite made and completely finished off as Lord Protector; and several
of the Ironsides preached about it at great length, all the evening.

LION HOTEL, SHREWSBURY, _Thursday, Nov. 1st, 1838._

“Goes out pretty well every day, don’t she?”

GENTLEMEN,—To say that I thank you for the earnest manner in which you
have drunk the toast just now so eloquently proposed to you—to say that I
give you back your kind wishes and good feelings with more than compound
interest; and that I feel how dumb and powerless the best acknowledgments
would be beside such genial hospitality as yours, is nothing.  To say
that in this winter season, flowers have sprung up in every footstep’s
length of the path which has brought me here; that no country ever smiled
more pleasantly than yours has smiled on me, and that I have rarely
looked upon a brighter summer prospect than that which lies before me
now, {63} is nothing.

The unfortunate Mr Venus gives him a shake of the hand with a shake of
his own head, and drooping down in his chair, proceeds to pour himself
out more tea. Mr Wegg, looking back over his shoulder as he pulls the
door open by the strap, notices that the movement so shakes the crazy
shop, and so shakes a momentary flare out of the candle, as that the
babies—Hindoo, African, and British—the ‘human warious’, the French
gentleman, the green glass-eyed cats, the dogs, the ducks, and all
the rest of the collection, show for an instant as if paralytically
animated; while even poor little Cock Robin at Mr Venus’s elbow turns
over on his innocent side. Next moment, Mr Wegg is stumping under the
gaslights and through the mud.

‘I have just returned from the deck.  The trunk is standing upon the
extreme brink of the wharf, but the old gentleman is nowhere to be seen.
The watchman is not sure whether he went down or not, but promises to
drag for him the first thing to-morrow morning.  May his humane efforts
prove successful!

We all know, on the other hand, the great station hotel belonging to the
company of proprietors, which has suddenly sprung up in the back
outskirts of any place we like to name, and where we look out of our
palatial windows at little back yards and gardens, old summer-houses,
fowl-houses, pigeon-traps, and pigsties.  We all know this hotel in which
we can get anything we want, after its kind, for money; but where nobody
is glad to see us, or sorry to see us, or minds (our bill paid) whether
we come or go, or how, or when, or why, or cares about us.  We all know
this hotel, where we have no individuality, but put ourselves into the
general post, as it were, and are sorted and disposed of according to our
division.  We all know that we can get on very well indeed at such a
place, but still not perfectly well; and this may be, because the place
is largely wholesale, and there is a lingering personal retail interest
within us that asks to be satisfied.

Rob the Grinder, in his modesty, would have walked behind, but Miss Tox
desired him to keep beside her, for conversational purposes; and, as
she afterwards expressed it to his mother, “drew him out,” upon the
road.

“No.”

[Illustration]

THE beautiful metropolis of America is by no means so clean a city as
Boston, but many of its streets have the same characteristics; except
that the houses are not quite so fresh-coloured, the sign-boards are not
quite so gaudy, the gilded letters not quite so golden, the bricks not
quite so red, the stone not quite so white, the blinds and area railings
not quite so green, the knobs and plates upon the street doors not quite
so bright and twinkling.  There are many by-streets, almost as neutral in
clean colours, and positive in dirty ones, as by-streets in London; and
there is one quarter, commonly called the Five Points, which, in respect
of filth and wretchedness, may be safely backed against Seven Dials, or
any other part of famed St. Giles’s.

The old lady then stepped into her seat, and Mr Abel (whom they had
come to fetch) into his.  The old gentleman, after reasoning with the
pony on the extreme impropriety of his conduct, and making the best
amends in his power to Mr Chuckster, took his place also, and they
drove away, waving a farewell to the Notary and his clerk, and more
than once turning to nod kindly to Kit as he watched them from the road.

"David," said Mr. Murdstone, "to the young this is a world for action;
not for moping and droning in."

“How beautiful you are! You are more beautiful in anger than in repose.
I don’t ask you for your love; give me yourself and your hatred; give
me yourself and that pretty rage; give me yourself and that enchanting
scorn; it will be enough for me.”

[Sidenote: Mr. Clarkson Stanfield.]

‘I dropped down upon you, then, you ill-conditioned man,’ (Jeremiah
chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase,) ‘for having been
needlessly significant to Arthur that morning. I have a right to
complain of it as almost a breach of confidence. You did not mean it--’

Yet the time is so short since his depreciation began that as he
saunters away, reluctant to leave the spot for some long months
together, though he hates it, Richard himself may feel his own case
as if it were a startling one. While his heart is heavy with
corroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt, it may have room for
some sorrowful wonder when he recalls how different his first visit
there, how different he, how different all the colours of his mind.
But injustice breeds injustice; the fighting with shadows and being
defeated by them necessitates the setting up of substances to combat;
from the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand, the time
for that being long gone by, it has become a gloomy relief to turn to
the palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him from this
ruin and make HIM his enemy. Richard has told Vholes the truth. Is he
in a hardened or a softened mood, he still lays his injuries equally
at that door; he was thwarted, in that quarter, of a set purpose, and
that purpose could only originate in the one subject that is
resolving his existence into itself; besides, it is a justification
to him in his own eyes to have an embodied antagonist and oppressor.

As they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart of
the turmoil, the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more
forcibly on the senses. The streets were thronged with working people.
The hum of labour resounded from every house; lights gleamed from the
long casement windows in the attic storeys, and the whirl of wheels and
noise of machinery shook the trembling walls. The fires, whose lurid,
sullen light had been visible for miles, blazed fiercely up, in the
great works and factories of the town. The din of hammers, the rushing
of steam, and the dead heavy clanking of engines, was the harsh music
which arose from every quarter.

Neither did he himself remain in the same place; for, Sir Joseph Bowley,
Friend and Father of the Poor, held a great festivity at Bowley Hall, in
honour of the natal day of Lady Bowley.  And as Lady Bowley had been born
on New Year’s Day (which the local newspapers considered an especial
pointing of the finger of Providence to number One, as Lady Bowley’s
destined figure in Creation), it was on a New Year’s Day that this
festivity took place.

“Lor!” said Noah, reflectively; “how queer!”

LIVES OF SCHILLER AND JOHN STERLING. 1 vol., 6s.

‘But the accursed harvest of our mistaken lives shall be trodden down.
It is not too late for that. You are confronted with this man, you
monster there; not to be spared, but to be dealt with justly. Hear what
he says! Reply, be silent, contradict, repeat, defy, do what you please.
My course will be the same. Go on! And you,’ he said to Chuffey, ‘for
the love of your old friend, speak out, good fellow!’

We saw the gentleman four times in all, and when he took down my name and
asked how in the world it ever chanced to be Doctor, it come out that he
was own nephew by the sister's side, if you'll believe me, to the very
Doctor that I was called after.  This made our footing still easier, and
he says to me:

THE ACCUSED

‘Here’s your portmanteau,’ he said to Arthur, putting it carefully down.

‘It would have been better for you, I think, if it had been your last
also,’ replied Ralph.

She wept so bitterly now, and was so much distressed, that he thought it
prudent to unclasp her waist, and hold her only by the hand.

“At poor Miss Flite’s,” said Caddy. “Somebody who has been very good
to her was hurrying away an hour ago to join a ship and left these
flowers behind. No, no! Don’t take them out. Let the pretty little
things lie here,” said Caddy, adjusting them with a careful hand,
“because I was present myself, and I shouldn’t wonder if somebody
left them on purpose!”

"The idea!" said Miss Nupkins, forcing a tear of very scanty
proportions into the corner of each eye; "the idea of my being made
such a fool of!"

Prosperous, a small but thriving town, then generally inhabited by
persons manufacturing cottons, is seventeen miles from Dublin. It was
garrisoned by a detachment of the North Cork Militia, some forty men
under Captain Swayne, with a lieutenant and twenty of the Ancient
British Cavalry. The infantry occupied a temporary barrack, half the
cavalry were quartered in an opposite house, and the remainder in single
billets. On the Sunday (20th) previous to the outbreak Swayne arrived
in Prosperous with his detachment. He attended at the chapel with Dr.
Esmond, a man of great local influence, and then implored the people
there assembled to deliver up any arms which might be concealed, return
to their allegiance, and receive the protection he was authorised
to grant them. This exhortation proved ineffectual; some coercive
measures--such as the seizure of cattle, then warranted by martial
law--were resorted to; and on the 23rd it was intimated that fear had
hitherto prevented the peasantry from bringing the concealed arms to
the town, and that should they be permitted to enter after dark,
unchallenged and unmolested, on the following night, pikes and firearms
would be brought in and deposited in the streets.

Now, my dear Bulwer, I have come to the small hours, and am writing
alone here, as if _I_ were writing something to do what your comedy
will. At such a time the temptation is strong upon me to say a great
deal more, but I will only say this--in mercy to you--that I do devoutly
believe that this plan carried, will entirely change the status of the
literary man in England, and make a revolution in his position, which no
Government, no power on earth but his own, could ever effect. I have
implicit confidence in the scheme--so splendidly begun--if we carry it
out with a steadfast energy. I have a strong conviction that we hold in
our hands the peace and honour of men of letters for centuries to come,
and that you are destined to be their best and most enduring benefactor.

I looked at her, but I could not see her, I could not hear her, I
could not draw my breath. The beating of my heart was so violent and
wild that I felt as if my life were breaking from me. But when she
caught me to her breast, kissed me, wept over me, compassionated me,
and called me back to myself; when she fell down on her knees and
cried to me, “Oh, my child, my child, I am your wicked and unhappy
mother! Oh, try to forgive me!”—when I saw her at my feet on the
bare earth in her great agony of mind, I felt, through all my tumult
of emotion, a burst of gratitude to the providence of God that I was
so changed as that I never could disgrace her by any trace of
likeness, as that nobody could ever now look at me and look at her
and remotely think of any near tie between us.

She softly played on, looking at me still.

"It's a bad job," he said, when I had done; "but the sun sets every day,
and people die every minute, and we mustn't be scared by the common lot.
If we failed to hold our own, because that equal foot at all men's doors
was heard knocking somewhere, every object in this world would slip from
us. No! Ride on! Rough-shod if need be, smooth-shod if that will do, but
ride on! Ride over all obstacles, and win the race!"

"Sam Weller, my Lord," replied that gentleman.

Eugene turned his eyes towards Lizzie, as if to spare her, and answered
nothing.

"Who is this?" said one of the officials.

I recoiled, with a cry that rang loud through the lurid air.

"Vy, sir," exclaimed Mr. Weller, rubbing his hands, "how they would go
if they had been!"

‘My dear sir,’ urged the little man again.

‘Stay here,’ he replied.

Running to the window, he opened it and put out his head. No fog, no
mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood
to dance to--golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry
bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!

‘He must be asleep by this time,’ said John Evenson to himself, after
waiting with exemplary patience for nearly an hour after Mr. Gobler had
left the drawing-room. He listened for a few moments; the house was
perfectly quiet; he extinguished his rushlight, and opened his bedroom
door. The staircase was so dark that it was impossible to see anything.

“Beastly place,” said Drummle. “Your part of the country, I think?”

“Well, my lad,” replied the Captain, after a little sagacious
consideration. “I don’t know. You being here to keep her company, you
see, and you two being jintly—”

‘I’m an Englishman, ain’t I?’ rejoined the Dodger. ‘Where are my
priwileges?’

While the girl was gone on this errand, Mrs. Nickleby hastily swept into
a cupboard all vestiges of eating and drinking; which she had scarcely
done, and seated herself with looks as collected as she could assume,
when two gentlemen, both perfect strangers, presented themselves.

The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my
pleasant agitation, for my mother. It was not she, but a strange
servant.

“My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
even magnanimous things.”

‘Why, Cook! what are you thinking of so steadily?’ said Martin.

‘Stop thief! Stop thief!’ There is a magic in the sound. The
tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the
butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his
pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the school-boy his marbles;
the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away they run,
pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming,
knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing
up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and
courts, re-echo with the sound.

I think I never saw anything more ridiculous--I was sensible of it, even
at the time--than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards with the ruler,
and crying "Come on!" while Traddles and I pushed him back into a
corner, from which, as often as we got him into it, he persisted in
emerging again.

‘You are the best of creatures--no, I beg your pardon!’ for the Doctor
made a gesture of deprecation, ‘I must say before your face, as I always
say behind your back, you are the best of creatures; but of course you
don’t--now do you?---enter into the same pursuits and fancies as Annie?’

‘How far is it to Dingley Dell?’

There was nobody at the chambers but Young Blight. That discreet youth,
sensible of a certain incongruity in the association of such a
client with the business that might be coming some day, with the best
intentions temporized with Dolls, and offered a shilling for coach-hire
home. Mr Dolls, accepting the shilling, promptly laid it out in
two threepennyworths of conspiracy against his life, and two
threepennyworths of raging repentance. Returning to the Chambers with
which burden, he was descried coming round into the court, by the wary
young Blight watching from the window: who instantly closed the outer
door, and left the miserable object to expend his fury on the panels.

‘Mine,’ replied Monks.

,,

‘It may be, dear Little Dorrit.’

“Why, it’s true,” returns one of the policemen. “That’s what it is.
Now move on here, come!”

‘What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!’ said Duff, addressing
Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt.

They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an
invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been
hidden somewhere below, and bidding him go first, and bear the light,
returned to the chamber he had just quitted.

“You give the message,” said the girl firmly; “and let me hear the
answer.”

Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and
betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant
Bounderby.

After a stroll about the town I went to Ham’s house. Peggotty had now
removed here for good; and had let her own house to the successor of
Mr. Barkis in the carrying business, who had paid her very well for the
good-will, cart, and horse. I believe the very same slow horse that Mr.
Barkis drove was still at work.

WHOM GOD IN HIS GOODNESS CALLED TO A BRIGHT ETERNITY
                      WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG.

‘Mr. Firebras,’ said Randulph, composing himself, ‘this is not the time
to put such a question to me.’

He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,
and towelling himself.

“Wally, my dear boy,” said Solomon, “if the cosy little old lady had
taken her place in this parlour five and forty years ago, I never could
have been fonder of her than I am of you.”

[Sidenote: Mr. Rusden.]

‘Shouldn’t I? Well; perhaps I shouldn’t. But I should like to!’

I said, "Oh no, let me be alone," and I ran upstairs.

"The time has flown, dear Grace," he said, "since then;" they had been
talking of that night; "and yet it seems a long long while ago. We count
by changes and events within us. Not by years."

‘Yes, you have taken cold,’ said Daniel Doyce. But without looking at
him.

CHARLES DICKENS.

"You can shake hands with me, Mr. Omer, if you please," said I, putting
out my own. "You were very good-natured to me once, when I am afraid I
didn't show that I thought so."

"Did he say that?" inquired Mr. Weller.

Assenting with a movement of his head, though not at all looking as if
it did, the Secretary replied:

The scene of the suffering of these two good Protestant men was in the
City ditch, near Baliol College. On coming to the dreadful spot, they
kissed the stakes, and then embraced each other. And then a learned
doctor got up into a pulpit which was placed there, and preached a
sermon from the text, ‘Though I give my body to be burned, and have not
charity, it profiteth me nothing.’ When you think of the charity of
burning men alive, you may imagine that this learned doctor had a
rather brazen face. Ridley would have answered his sermon when it came
to an end, but was not allowed. When Latimer was stripped, it appeared
that he had dressed himself under his other clothes, in a new shroud;
and, as he stood in it before all the people, it was noted of him, and
long remembered, that, whereas he had been stooping and feeble but a
few minutes before, he now stood upright and handsome, in the knowledge
that he was dying for a just and a great cause. Ridley’s brother-in-law
was there with bags of gunpowder; and when they were both chained up,
he tied them round their bodies. Then, a light was thrown upon the pile
to fire it. ‘Be of good comfort, Master Ridley,’ said Latimer, at that
awful moment, ‘and play the man! We shall this day light such a candle,
by God’s grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.’ And
then he was seen to make motions with his hands as if he were washing
them in the flames, and to stroke his aged face with them, and was
heard to cry, ‘Father of Heaven, receive my soul!’ He died quickly, but
the fire, after having burned the legs of Ridley, sunk. There he
lingered, chained to the iron post, and crying, ‘O! I cannot burn! O!
for Christ’s sake let the fire come unto me!’ And still, when his
brother-in-law had heaped on more wood, he was heard through the
blinding smoke, still dismally crying, ‘O! I cannot burn, I cannot
burn!’ At last, the gunpowder caught fire, and ended his miseries.

"Well, well!" he said with a sigh, dismissing, as I then saw, some trial
she had borne, or was yet to bear, in connexion with what my aunt had
told me. "Well! I have never told you, Trotwood, of her mother. Has any
one?"

“Mr Dombey. He passed twice through the Counting House while I was
there. I had been able to avoid him before, but of course could not
hope to do that long. I know how natural it was that he should regard
my presence as something offensive; I felt it must be so, myself.”

They had no sooner arrived at this point, than a most violent and
startling knocking was heard at the door; it was not an ordinary double-
knock, but a constant and uninterrupted succession of the loudest single
raps, as if the knocker were endowed with the perpetual motion, or the
person outside had forgotten to leave off.

When Walter ceased to speak, Mr Dombey’s eyes were attracted to little
Paul, who, seeing his sister hanging down her head and silently weeping
in her commiseration for the distress she had heard described, went
over to her, and tried to comfort her: looking at Walter and his father
as he did so, with a very expressive face. After the momentary
distraction of Captain Cuttle’s address, which he regarded with lofty
indifference, Mr Dombey again turned his eyes upon his son, and sat
steadily regarding the child, for some moments, in silence.

‘Turned you faint, sir! Seems you’re not accustomed to this kind of
work?’

"That's your account," said Joe, "and I wouldn't give another sixpence,
if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who's next?"

"Mr. +Pickwick+ would not put up to be put down by clamour. He _had_
alluded to the honourable gentleman. (Great excitement.)

‘Upon my soul, it’s a most delightful thing,’ said Lord Frederick,
pressing forward. ‘How de do?’

‘Very well,’ said Mrs Quilp, nodding her head, ‘as I said just now,
it’s very easy to talk, but I say again that I know--that I’m
sure--Quilp has such a way with him when he likes, that the best
looking woman here couldn’t refuse him if I was dead, and she was free,
and he chose to make love to her. Come!’

‘Why, that depends, Mr Pinch,’ said Martin, laughing, ‘upon what sort
of a horse you have. Because if he’s a bad one, I would rather keep my
hands warm by holding them comfortably in my greatcoat pockets.’

‘What has happened, Martin?’ Tom anxiously inquired. ‘My dear fellow,
what bad news do you bring?’

“You see, Esther,” said Caddy, who thoroughly enjoyed a little
confidence, “after you spoke to me about its being wrong to marry
without Ma’s knowledge, or even to keep Ma long in the dark
respecting our engagement—though I don’t believe Ma cares much for
me, I must say—I thought it right to mention your opinions to
Prince. In the first place because I want to profit by everything you
tell me, and in the second place because I have no secrets from
Prince.”

‘This way, Mrs. Tibbs,’ whispered the delighted busybody: ‘give me your
hand—there! Whoever these people are, they are in the store-room now,
for I have been looking down from my window, and I could see that they
accidentally upset their candlestick, and are now in darkness. You have
no shoes on, have you?’

"You an't got no friends. Hurrah!" Then there came a turnip, then a
potato, and then an egg; with a few other little tokens of the playful
disposition of the many-headed.

This was just Mr. Dowler's opinion as he sat before the fire, and
felt honestly indignant with all the inhuman people at the party who
were keeping him up. He was not put into better humour either by the
reflection that he had taken it into his head, early in the evening, to
think that he had got an ache there, and so stopped at home. At length,
after several droppings asleep, and fallings forward towards the bars,
and catchings backward soon enough to prevent being branded in the
face, Mr. Dowler made up his mind that he would throw himself on the
bed in the back room and _think_--not sleep, of course.

‘I say I am in love. I am in love with one of the most beautiful girls
the sun ever shone upon. But she is wholly and entirely dependent upon
the pleasure of my grandfather; and if he were to know that she favoured
my passion, she would lose her home and everything she possesses in the
world. There is nothing very selfish in THAT love, I think?’

[Sidenote: Mr. W. C. Macready.]

"Arrah! the devil a fear of that," returned the landlord. "Your modesty
nivir stopped your promotion, _Shawn avourneen_![53]" and he of the Cock
and Punchbowl laughed heartily as the traveller entered the parlour.

‘Coom,’ retorted John, ‘thot’s tidy in you, thot is. If it wa’nt along
o’ you, we shouldn’t know nought aboot ‘un. Thou know’d ‘un first,
Tilly, didn’t thou?’

Sam bore in mind his master’s caution, and replied--

"The sister _is_ married then," returned the stranger. He paused for
some time before he asked, "To whom?"

Granted. We are ready to acknowledge that in outward show, these
processions have greatly improved: we do not deny the introduction of
solos on the drum; we will even go so far as to admit an occasional
fantasia on the triangle, but here our admissions end. We positively
deny that the sweeps have art or part in these proceedings. We
distinctly charge the dustmen with throwing what they ought to clear
away, into the eyes of the public. We accuse scavengers, brickmakers,
and gentlemen who devote their energies to the costermongering line,
with obtaining money once a-year, under false pretences. We cling with
peculiar fondness to the custom of days gone by, and have shut out
conviction as long as we could, but it has forced itself upon us; and
we now proclaim to a deluded public, that the May-day dancers are _not_
sweeps. The size of them, alone, is sufficient to repudiate the idea.
It is a notorious fact that the widely-spread taste for register-stoves
has materially increased the demand for small boys; whereas the men,
who, under a fictitious character, dance about the streets on the first
of May nowadays, would be a tight fit in a kitchen flue, to say nothing
of the parlour. This is strong presumptive evidence, but we have
positive proof—the evidence of our own senses. And here is our
testimony.

“Then, indeed, I seem to be naturally the person to go with you,”
returned Caddy.

"Do you not know me?" said this Eidolon of my wit, pointing to the
scroll. "I am the joke upon which you pride yourself, and, although I
say it myself, one of the best jokes that ever was uttered. Don't you
know me?"

"Old in troubles and trials, sir," replied the schoolmaster.

‘Understand me, my dear;’ thus she went on. ‘I have never dreamed of
the possibility of his being anything to me on this earth but the
kind picture that I know I could not make you understand, if the
understanding was not in your own breast already. I have no more dreamed
of the possibility of MY being his wife, than he ever has—and words
could not be stronger than that. And yet I love him. I love him so much,
and so dearly, that when I sometimes think my life may be but a weary
one, I am proud of it and glad of it. I am proud and glad to suffer
something for him, even though it is of no service to him, and he will
never know of it or care for it.’

‘Upon my word, my dear, I don’t know,’ replied Mrs. Nickleby. ‘Roast pig;
let me see. On the day five weeks after you were christened, we had a
roast--no, that couldn’t have been a pig, either, because I recollect
there were a pair of them to carve, and your poor papa and I could
never have thought of sitting down to two pigs--they must have been
partridges. Roast pig! I hardly think we ever could have had one, now
I come to remember, for your papa could never bear the sight of them
in the shops, and used to say that they always put him in mind of very
little babies, only the pigs had much fairer complexions; and he had a
horror of little babies, too, because he couldn’t very well afford any
increase to his family, and had a natural dislike to the subject. It’s
very odd now, what can have put that in my head! I recollect dining
once at Mrs. Bevan’s, in that broad street round the corner by the
coachmaker’s, where the tipsy man fell through the cellar-flap of an
empty house nearly a week before the quarter-day, and wasn’t found till
the new tenant went in--and we had roast pig there. It must be that, I
think, that reminds me of it, especially as there was a little bird in
the room that would keep on singing all the time of dinner--at least,
not a little bird, for it was a parrot, and he didn’t sing exactly, for
he talked and swore dreadfully: but I think it must be that. Indeed I am
sure it must. Shouldn’t you say so, my dear?’

‘Out of affection and regard for you, Susan and Kenwigs,’ said Mr
Lillyvick, ‘and not out of revenge and spite against her, for she is
below it, I shall, tomorrow morning, settle upon your children, and make
payable to the survivors of them when they come of age of marry, that
money that I once meant to leave ‘em in my will. The deed shall be
executed tomorrow, and Mr. Noggs shall be one of the witnesses. He hears
me promise this, and he shall see it done.’

“Ay, he comes back,” said the landlord, “to his great friends, now and
again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.”

‘Since you insist upon the term, sir, yes,’ replied Nicholas.

The room had no other light than that which it derived from a dim and
dirt-clogged lamp, whose lazy wick, being still further obscured by a
dark shade, cast its feeble rays over a very little space, and left all
beyond in heavy shadow. This lamp the money-lender had drawn so close to
him, that there was only room between it and himself for the book over
which he bent; and as he sat, with his elbows on the desk, and his sharp
cheek-bones resting on his hands, it only served to bring out his ugly
features in strong relief, together with the little table at which he
sat, and to shroud all the rest of the chamber in a deep sullen gloom.
Raising his eyes, and looking vacantly into this gloom as he made some
mental calculation, Arthur Gride suddenly met the fixed gaze of a man.

When I say we settled this or that, I do not mean that we planned
anything with any confidence as to what might happen an hour hence.  So
much had happened in one night, and such great changes had been violently
and suddenly made in the fortunes of many among us, that we had got
better used to uncertainty, in a little while, than I dare say most
people do in the course of their lives.

‘Without saying more?’ cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very
suppression, seemed only the more furious. ‘It’s a lie! I’ll not be
played with. She said more. I’ll tear the life out of you both, but
I’ll know what it was.’

“I think, my dear son,” returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his
shoulder, “that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and
that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more
fleeting. Above all, I think” said the lady, fixing her eyes on her
son’s face, “that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a
wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no
fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and
upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the
world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against
him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent
of the connection he formed in early life. And she may have the pain of
knowing that he does so.”

The two doors were still closed, the door communicating with the
servant's room still locked.  In the corner of the wall, into which
he had so convulsively niched himself, lay the dog.  I called to
him,--no movement; I approached,--the animal was dead: his eyes
protruded; his tongue out of his mouth; the froth gathered round
his jaws.  I took him in my arms; I brought him to the fire.  I
felt acute grief for the loss of my poor favorite,--acute self-
reproach; I accused myself of his death; I imagined he had died of
fright.  But what was my surprise on finding that his neck was
actually broken.  Had this been done in the dark?  Must it not have
been by a hand human as mine; must there not have been a human
agency all the while in that room?  Good cause to suspect it.  I
cannot tell.  I cannot do more than state the fact fairly; the
reader may draw his own inference.

"The devil gave a knowing look, and, dipping his hand into the left
breeches-pocket, took out a piece of paper, and, as an attorney shows
the corner of a promissory-note to an unwilling witness, he held it out
to Tom, and asked him was it his hand-writing: 'Tummas a Brawdeen,'[59]
says he, in Irish, 'is that yer fist?'

CHAPTER IX. A DISCOVERY AND A CHASE

‘I have dry clothes, or at least such as will serve my turn well, in
my bundle,’ replied Nicholas. ‘If you look so distressed to see me, you
will add to the pain I feel already, at being compelled, for one night,
to cast myself upon your slender means for aid and shelter.’

The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had
not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.

‘The lying-in room, I suppose?’ said Mr. Bumble, not quite following
the stranger’s excited description.

It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the
gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie), and walked
distractedly into the street.

_Bel._ Yes, poor Tiny Tim!

She drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it, and
shuddering as their hands approach. “Now,” she adds, “show me the
spot again!”

‘Your must say it all over again, if it’s anything you want me
to do,’ rejoined Nancy; ‘and if it is, you had better wait till
to-morrow. You put me up for a minute; but now I’m stupid again.’

‘The word which separates us,’ said Nicholas, grasping him heartily by
the shoulder, ‘shall never be said by me, for you are my only comfort
and stay. I would not lose you now, Smike, for all the world could give.
The thought of you has upheld me through all I have endured today, and
shall, through fifty times such trouble. Give me your hand. My heart is
linked to yours. We will journey from this place together, before the
week is out. What, if I am steeped in poverty? You lighten it, and we
will be poor together.’

"I'll owe you five," said Arabella, "for old acquaintance' sake,
you know;" and another most captivating smile was bestowed upon the
corpulent intruder.

He made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange; at one
time coming out with a fishing-rod, at another with a fiddle, at another
with a cocked hat, at another with a flute. But I resisted all these
overtures, and sat there in desperation; each time asking him, with
tears in my eyes, for my money or my jacket. At last he began to pay me
in halfpence at a time; and was full two hours getting by easy stages to
a shilling.

‘Heaven forbid!’ said Mr Pecksniff. ‘My dear sir, there are other ways.
There are indeed. But I am much excited and embarrassed at present, and
would rather not pursue the subject. I scarcely know what I mean. Permit
me to resume it at another time.’

No. Again it seems doubtful.

"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles--You
do it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign
concerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever,
and you shall be let to live." Then he let him go, saying--"You remember
what you've undertook, and you get home."

"A'nt it kind of him?" said Clemency.

Bradley looked down with a ghastly relish. ‘You run about the brink, and
run across it, in this uncertain light, on a few inches width of rotten
wood,’ said he. ‘I wonder you have no thought of being drowned.’

“Has anybody ever seen the woman as plainly as the owl?”

Bella felt that Mrs Boffin was not comfortable, and that the eyes of
that good creature sought to discover from her face what attention she
had given to this discourse, and what impression it had made upon her.
For which reason Bella’s eyes drooped more engrossedly over her book,
and she turned the page with an air of profound absorption in it.

Sent Postpaid on Receipt of Price

‘That’s his impudence--that’s his confounded impudence,’ said Captain
Boldwig. ‘He’s only feigning to be asleep now,’ said the captain, in a
high passion. ‘He’s drunk; he’s a drunken plebeian. Wheel him away,
Wilkins, wheel him away directly.’

Now, merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time, enabling me, without
a wasted moment, to have got the boat afloat again, and to row back
against the stream! And grant, O Blessed Lord God, that through poor me
he may be raised from death, and preserved to some one else to whom he
may be dear one day, though never dearer than to me!

“Yes, I suppose so.”

It is out of the power of fortune or of fate to excite such feelings
within me now as pressed upon my heart for some days after this scene.
I thank God for it. Human strength or weakness could not again endure
so dreadful a conflict of brute passion and of human feeling. That
piteous face raised to mine would not depart from me. That she should
kneel,--that she should have been degraded abjectly to crouch before me
for forgiveness, for pardon, for the vilest pity,--and that I should
know and feel that the base expiation was the poorest recompense--oh! I
cannot pursue this farther.

“My friends,” says Chadband, “we have partaken in moderation” (which
was certainly not the case so far as he was concerned) “of the
comforts which have been provided for us. May this house live upon
the fatness of the land; may corn and wine be plentiful therein; may
it grow, may it thrive, may it prosper, may it advance, may it
proceed, may it press forward! But, my friends, have we partaken of
anything else? We have. My friends, of what else have we partaken? Of
spiritual profit? Yes. From whence have we derived that spiritual
profit? My young friend, stand forth!”

“I don’t mean any harm,” answered her husband; “only it strikes me that
Miss was pleased to buy the carriage because it was pretty, and seemed a
great thing to send us, and that she wouldn’t have cared a straw to give
us a little cash, that would have served us every bit as well.”

‘But I DO mind,’ said the Old Soldier, laying her fan upon his lips. ‘I
mind very much. I recall these things that I may be contradicted if I am
wrong. Well! Then I spoke to Annie, and I told her what had happened.
I said, “My dear, here’s Doctor Strong has positively been and made you
the subject of a handsome declaration and an offer.” Did I press it in
the least? No. I said, “Now, Annie, tell me the truth this moment; is
your heart free?” “Mama,” she said crying, “I am extremely young”--which
was perfectly true--“and I hardly know if I have a heart at all.” “Then,
my dear,” I said, “you may rely upon it, it’s free. At all events, my
love,” said I, “Doctor Strong is in an agitated state of mind, and
must be answered. He cannot be kept in his present state of suspense.”
 “Mama,” said Annie, still crying, “would he be unhappy without me? If he
would, I honour and respect him so much, that I think I will have him.”
 So it was settled. And then, and not till then, I said to Annie, “Annie,
Doctor Strong will not only be your husband, but he will represent your
late father: he will represent the head of our family, he will represent
the wisdom and station, and I may say the means, of our family; and will
be, in short, a Boon to it.” I used the word at the time, and I have
used it again, today. If I have any merit it is consistency.’

“None,” replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. “He wont
stir till it’s all safe. Depend on it that they’re on the scent down
there, and that if he moved he’d blow upon the thing at once. He’s all
right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. I’ll pound it
that Barney’s managing properly. Let him alone for that.”

Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure
that Miss Havisham’s face could not smile. It had dropped into a
watchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things about
her had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever lift
it up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice
had dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;
altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,
within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.

‘_Personal Encounter_.

He laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair,
and said gaily:

“Rough, cold night, Sir,” replied the man; “and there’s a wind got up
that drifts it across the fields, in a thick white cloud.”

[Illustration: _Oliver plucks up a spirit._]

‘What do you mean,’ said the tinker, ‘by wearing my brother’s silk
handkerchief! Give it over here!’ And he had mine off my neck in a
moment, and tossed it to the woman.

“It is no service to me,” said the brother. “It only leads to such a
conversation as the present, which I need not say I could have well
spared. No one can be a better friend to me:” he spoke here very
distinctly, as if he would impress it upon Walter: “than in forgetting
me, and leaving me to go my way, unquestioned and unnoticed.”

"I run more risk from gunpowder than anything else," said the younger
man. "I am a slate-miner, and am continually blasting. I have, however,
had my falls. Are you going far to-night, sir?"

Nor was Mr. Bumble’s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a
pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not
wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own
person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the
position of his affairs. The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where
were they? He still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings
on his nether limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches. The coat
was wide-skirted; and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how
different! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.
Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle.

Without a word of reply, Bradley passed quickly from him over the wooden
bridge on the lock gates. ‘Why, there’s even less sense in this move
than t’other,’ said Riderhood, following. ‘The Weir’s there, and you’ll
have to come back, you know.’

‘Oh, very good,’ said the judge; ‘I never had the pleasure of hearing
the gentleman’s name before.’ Here Mr. Phunky bowed and smiled, and the
judge bowed and smiled too, and then Mr. Phunky, blushing into the very
whites of his eyes, tried to look as if he didn’t know that everybody
was gazing at him, a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet, or
in all reasonable probability, ever will.

“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s enemy,” said
the gentleman; “far more natural.”

‘At Martigny, of course,’ said Fanny. ‘Charmed, I am sure!’

The sea has no appreciation of great men,
    but knocks them about like small fry.

Her master’s wedding and the journey to Florence were a dream to her.
Though the strange sights of a strange city slowly restored her
perceptions, they did not her cheerfulness. She felt as if she could no
longer endure the misery of her life; she prayed to die.

In his fondness for society and his adaptability to all grades, Mr.
Bucket is presently standing before the hall-fire—bright and warm on
the early winter night—admiring Mercury.

At length Mr. Stiggins, with several most indubitable symptoms of having
quite as much pine-apple rum-and-water about him as he could comfortably
accommodate, took his hat, and his leave; and Sam was, immediately
afterwards, shown to bed by his father. The respectable old gentleman
wrung his hand fervently, and seemed disposed to address some
observation to his son; but on Mrs. Weller advancing towards him, he
appeared to relinquish that intention, and abruptly bade him good-night.

She read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
receipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled
again, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the
pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without
looking at me.

The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at
his hardest speed.

But he only looked up with a bewildered smile. “Yes, God has been good.
This is Ellen, Captain. And my little son. _My little son._”

‘We are interrupted, my charmer!’ he cried, getting up, with a
countenance of angry dismay. ‘Let us return to the public promenade. You
won’t refuse me? I shall kill myself, ‘pon rep, if you do.’

‘At what hour?’ asked the voice.

I saw the mild eye of the good old Doctor turned upon me for a moment,
and I felt that the confession of my old misgivings and remembrances
was too plainly written in my face to be overlooked. It was of no use
raging. I could not undo that. Say what I would, I could not unsay it.

‘She laughs so,’ said Jonas; ‘there’s no talking to her. Only hark how
she’s a-going on now! You’re the sensible one, cousin!’

I understood Mrs. Micawber now, and begged her to make use of me to any
extent. I began to dispose of the more portable articles of property
that very evening; and went out on a similar expedition almost every
morning, before I went to Murdstone and Grinby’s.

So saying, he blew out the candle, kicked off his shoes, and groped his
way up stairs; leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of
summersets on the pavement.

(‘That’s it!’ from Brother Gimblet.)

Mrs. Squeers came in, still habited in the primitive night-jacket which
had displayed the symmetry of her figure on the previous night, and
further ornamented with a beaver bonnet of some antiquity, which she
wore, with much ease and lightness, on the top of the nightcap before
mentioned.

Not only was there the abstinence from conversation, which I have noted,
but action--the common ordinary motions of gentlemen meeting in assembly
were suspended. The benches were filled with unwonted regularity; and
their occupants, scarcely venturing on a whisper, and hardly changing
their position, seemed almost like breathing statues, while they awaited
with awful interest the announcement of what steps the government
proposed to take, and what information had been obtained by them
respecting the event which had deprived the administration of its chief.

The two gentlemen watched Oliver’s earnest face, as he spoke, and
looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the
accuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any
appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was
long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had
crushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay;
but in no one place could they discern the print of men’s shoes, or
the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed
the ground for hours before.

Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness;
and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to
his nose.

‘Oh! she were very bad the other night, sir, indeed she were, said
Miggs. ‘If you hadn’t the sweetness of an angel in you, mim, I don’t
think you could abear it, I raly don’t.’

“I surprise you, sir?” he said, with a quick change to a submissive
manner.

That Quilp lied most heartily in this speech, it needed no very great
penetration to discover, although for anything that he suffered to
appear in his face, voice, or manner, he might have been clinging to
the truth with the quiet constancy of a martyr.

‘For any shelter he can find,’ the old man answered. ‘He has deceived
you.’

There was no time to inquire to what this exclamation, which was
delivered in a very rapturous tone, referred; for he had already thrown
open the door of the room; into which Nicholas, followed by Smike with
the bundle on his shoulder (he carried it about with him as vigilantly
as if it had been a sack of gold), straightway repaired.

‘Make yourself easy about that there, my dear,’ replied the little man.
‘If he was so much as to move a inch without leave, Green would jist
fetch him a crack over the head with the telescope, as would send him
into the bottom of the basket in no time, and stun him till they come
down again.’

This was at the expiration of about six weeks. I had suffered tortures
all the time; and thought I really must have laid violent hands upon
myself, when Miss Mills still reported to me, that my broken-hearted
little Dora would say nothing, when I was mentioned, but "Oh, poor papa!
Oh, dear papa!" Also, that she had no other relations than two aunts,
maiden sisters of Mr. Spenlow, who lived at Putney, and who had not held
any other than chance communication with their brother for many years.
Not that they had ever quarrelled (Miss Mills informed me); but that
having been, on the occasion of Dora's christening, invited to tea, when
they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner, they had
expressed their opinion in writing, that it was "better for the
happiness of all parties" that they should stay away. Since which they
had gone their road, and their brother had gone his.

It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became
thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.
Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,
but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his
knees.

‘Has anything more been heard, Veneering,’ he inquired, ‘of the lucky
legatee?’

Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with
great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and
dragging her unwilling consort after him.

As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more
and more, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington,
Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and
yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their
journey. At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and
Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off.
And here, the cart stopped.

"Thank'ee," said Scrooge. "I am much obliged to you.
I thank you fifty times. Bless you!"

Isabel said, “Good-bye, Fanny. I am very, very sorry to disappoint you
of your treat at L----, but I intended to have borrowed the two pounds
of Miss Laura, and I find she cannot lend them to me. Never mind, I am
sure you will be happy enough in your little cottage. I never saw such a
sweet little place as it is.” So the bridal party drove away.

His daughters arrived, with Mr. Frank Beard, this same evening. His
eldest son the next morning, and his son Henry and his sister Letitia in
the evening of the 9th--too late, alas!

Among this knot of sage and learned men, no one was so eminently
distinguished, during many years, for the quiet modesty of his
appearance and demeanour, as Nicholas Tulrumble, the well-known
coal-dealer. However exciting the subject of discussion, however
animated the tone of the debate, or however warm the personalities
exchanged, (and even in Mudfog we get personal sometimes,) Nicholas
Tulrumble was always the same. To say truth, Nicholas, being an
industrious man, and always up betimes, was apt to fall asleep when a
debate began, and to remain asleep till it was over, when he would wake
up very much refreshed, and give his vote with the greatest complacency.
The fact was, that Nicholas Tulrumble, knowing that everybody there, had
made up his mind beforehand, considered the talking as just a long hot
botheration about nothing at all; and to the present hour it remains a
question, whether, on this point at all events, Nicholas Tulrumble was
not pretty near right.

"Do you know anything more," said I, standing composedly before her--she
had patted me on the shoulder, and sat down in my chair, "of that
attachment of Agnes?"

"Oh yes," said the little man, "very much so indeed. We have opened
all the public-houses in the place, and left our adversary nothing but
the beer-shops--masterly stroke of policy that, my dear sir, eh?"--the
little man smiled complacently, and took a large pinch of snuff.

"I should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the
purpose," said Mr. Tracy Tupman, "but you are rather slim, and I am----"

The Major was staying at the Royal Hotel, with his friend Dombey.

The father was puzzled; he was always giving away money in charity
himself, and he could scarcely reprimand the child for doing the same.
He looked at him for some seconds with a perplexed countenance, and
then, contenting himself with simply saying, "I'll beat you," sent him
to bed.

“What,” said Richard, in a tone of perfect conviction, “but the
army!”

Misfortunes, saith the adage, never come singly. There is little doubt
that troubles are exceedingly gregarious in their nature, and flying
in flocks, are apt to perch capriciously; crowding on the heads of some
poor wights until there is not an inch of room left on their unlucky
crowns, and taking no more notice of others who offer as good
resting-places for the soles of their feet, than if they had no
existence. It may have happened that a flight of troubles brooding over
London, and looking out for Joseph Willet, whom they couldn’t find,
darted down haphazard on the first young man that caught their fancy,
and settled on him instead. However this may be, certain it is that on
the very day of Joe’s departure they swarmed about the ears of Edward
Chester, and did so buzz and flap their wings, and persecute him, that
he was most profoundly wretched.

The Princess Alicia embraced her, and then Grandmarina turned to the King,
and said rather sharply:--"Are you good?"

But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or
knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer
in the striped waistcoat, and with the most piteous wailings and
lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use
of the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear
brother.

My aunt clapped her hands, and we all started up as if we were
possessed.

‘Don’t stir from here, for his sake!  Let me go and listen.’

She started at the word, and her looks expressed her natural horror. Yet
she still spoke aloud, when she demanded:--

They never turned away. She laid her hand upon her breast, murmuring
the sacred name that had been read to her; and life passed from her
face, like light removed.

“Why do you stare?” asked Polly.

‘How goes the enemy, Snobb?’ asked Sir Mulberry Hawk.

‘An unnatural scoundrel!’ said Nicholas, indignantly.

“Get up!” said the man.

Phillips, Mr. Henry W., letter to, 231

The shadows grew longer and longer,
The evening wind passed by,
And the purple splendour of sunset
Was flooding the western sky.

‘How often have you seen her since?’

“And so do I!” said Edwin.

‘Then it’s all true and they really do! good gracious Arthur!--pray
excuse me--old habit--Mr Clennam far more proper--what a country to live
in for so long a time, and with so many lanterns and umbrellas too how
very dark and wet the climate ought to be and no doubt actually is, and
the sums of money that must be made by those two trades where everybody
carries them and hangs them everywhere, the little shoes too and the
feet screwed back in infancy is quite surprising, what a traveller you
are!’

I received your letter of from the 14th to the 17th of March, here, last
night. My New York doctor has prescribed for me promptly, and I hope I
am better. I am certainly no worse. We shall do (to the best of my
belief) _very well_ with the farewells here and at New York, but not
greatly. Everything is at a standstill, pending the impeachment and the
next presidential election. I forgot whether I told you that the New
York press are going to give me a public dinner, on Saturday, the 18th.

"Good Spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it:
"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet
may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!"

‘Mrs. Wititterly is quite a martyr,’ observed Pyke, with a complimentary
bow.

Her old friend was, to the full, as hearty and as glad as she; and it
really was, if you’ll believe me, quite a pleasant sight to see them
embrace.  Tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question.  May was very
pretty.

Time having made us wiser than _the Wortley_, it is amusing to see her
guessing at and confounding authors and their works.

The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of
the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging
his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there first. He
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given
information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.

Those who had steeds took the hint, and a numerous field of horsemen
joined in the chase of Handy Andy and Dick the Devil, who still
maintained great speed. The horsemen made for a neighbouring hill,
whence they could command a wider view; and the betting went on briskly,
varying according to the vicissitudes of the race.

"Think of that, Maggy!" said Little Dorrit, taking Maggy's two large
hands and clapping them together.  "A gentleman from thousands of miles
away, wanting to know your history!"

"No, he isn't," replied Mrs. Weller; for the rather stout lady was no
other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead-and-gone
Mr. Clarke. "No, he isn't, and I don't expect him, either."

This reference to Florence, who had been standing by the door not
unobservant of what passed, directed the attention of the younger
branches towards her; and had likewise the happy effect of leading to
the formal recognition of Miss Nipper, who was not quite free from a
misgiving that she had been already slighted.

‘Ay, stretch forth your arm over the scyphus, young gentleman,’ cried
Sir Norfolk, pointing to the bowl.

Jingle smiled, and moved towards the door.

"Yes, he's living, Sir," said Clemency.

A Western Christmas                    74
MRS. W. H. CORNING.

Clennam’s eyes had strayed to a natural picture on the wall, of two
pretty little girls with their arms entwined. ‘Yes, Clennam,’ said
Mr Meagles, in a lower voice. ‘There they both are. It was taken some
seventeen years ago. As I often say to Mother, they were babies then.’

This cosy couple (married, evidently) had made a fair division of the
fire between them, and sat looking at the glowing sparks that dropped
into the grate; now nodding off into a doze; now waking up again when
some hot fragment, larger than the rest, came rattling down, as if the
fire were coming with it.

Ever and always affectionately.

‘Nothing but rewolwers and bowie-knives,’ returned Mark. ‘And what are
they? Not worth mentioning!’

“That’s the way to talk, my dear,” replied Fagin, venturing to pat him
on the shoulder. “It does me good to hear you.”

“Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access
to him, once.”

Her father went on one side of her, while Dot remained upon the other:
holding her hand.

[Sidenote: Mr. William Harrison Ainsworth.]

"That is according to your own pleasure, my dear sir," said I,
affecting an indifference that I did not feel; but wishing to curb the
irritability of my young companion.

‘I do not,’ she said, gloomily. ‘There is little left to choose now.
Flintwinch, it is closing in.’

‘Put down that, Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate, who was fast rising
into a rage.

My first impressions of an Inn dated from the Nursery; consequently I
went back to the Nursery for a starting-point, and found myself at the
knee of a sallow woman with a fishy eye, an aquiline nose, and a green
gown, whose specially was a dismal narrative of a landlord by the
roadside, whose visitors unaccountably disappeared for many years, until
it was discovered that the pursuit of his life had been to convert them
into pies.  For the better devotion of himself to this branch of
industry, he had constructed a secret door behind the head of the bed;
and when the visitor (oppressed with pie) had fallen asleep, this wicked
landlord would look softly in with a lamp in one hand and a knife in the
other, would cut his throat, and would make him into pies; for which
purpose he had coppers, underneath a trap-door, always boiling; and
rolled out his pastry in the dead of the night.  Yet even he was not
insensible to the stings of conscience, for he never went to sleep
without being heard to mutter, "Too much pepper!" which was eventually
the cause of his being brought to justice.  I had no sooner disposed of
this criminal than there started up another of the same period, whose
profession was originally house-breaking; in the pursuit of which art he
had had his right ear chopped off one night, as he was burglariously
getting in at a window, by a brave and lovely servant-maid (whom the
aquiline-nosed woman, though not at all answering the description, always
mysteriously implied to be herself).  After several years, this brave and
lovely servant-maid was married to the landlord of a country Inn; which
landlord had this remarkable characteristic, that he always wore a silk
nightcap, and never would on any consideration take it off.  At last, one
night, when he was fast asleep, the brave and lovely woman lifted up his
silk nightcap on the right side, and found that he had no ear there; upon
which she sagaciously perceived that he was the clipped housebreaker, who
had married her with the intention of putting her to death.  She
immediately heated the poker and terminated his career, for which she was
taken to King George upon his throne, and received the compliments of
royalty on her great discretion and valour.  This same narrator, who had
a Ghoulish pleasure, I have long been persuaded, in terrifying me to the
utmost confines of my reason, had another authentic anecdote within her
own experience, founded, I now believe, upon _Raymond and Agnes, or the
Bleeding Nun_.  She said it happened to her brother-in-law, who was
immensely rich,--which my father was not; and immensely tall,--which my
father was not.  It was always a point with this Ghoul to present my
clearest relations and friends to my youthful mind under circumstances of
disparaging contrast.  The brother-in-law was riding once through a
forest on a magnificent horse (we had no magnificent horse at our house),
attended by a favourite and valuable Newfoundland dog (we had no dog),
when he found himself benighted, and came to an Inn.  A dark woman opened
the door, and he asked her if he could have a bed there.  She answered
yes, and put his horse in the stable, and took him into a room where
there were two dark men.  While he was at supper, a parrot in the room
began to talk, saying, "Blood, blood!  Wipe up the blood!"  Upon which
one of the dark men wrung the parrot's neck, and said he was fond of
roasted parrots, and he meant to have this one for breakfast in the
morning.  After eating and drinking heartily, the immensely rich, tall
brother-in-law went up to bed; but he was rather vexed, because they had
shut his dog in the stable, saying that they never allowed dogs in the
house.  He sat very quiet for more than an hour, thinking and thinking,
when, just as his candle was burning out, he heard a scratch at the door.
He opened the door, and there was the Newfoundland dog!  The dog came
softly in, smelt about him, went straight to some straw in the corner
which the dark men had said covered apples, tore the straw away, and
disclosed two sheets steeped in blood.  Just at that moment the candle
went out, and the brother-in-law, looking through a chink in the door,
saw the two dark men stealing up-stairs; one armed with a dagger that
long (about five feet); the other carrying a chopper, a sack, and a
spade.  Having no remembrance of the close of this adventure, I suppose
my faculties to have been always so frozen with terror at this stage of
it, that the power of listening stagnated within me for some quarter of
an hour.

We are all extremely concerned and distressed to lose you. But we feel
that it cannot be otherwise, and we do not, in our own expectation of
amusement, forget the sad cause of your absence.

SCR. I do--I must! But why do spirits walk the earth? Why do they come
to me?

But the Billickin had somehow come to the knowledge that Miss
Twinkleton kept a school. The leap from that knowledge to the inference
that Miss Twinkleton set herself to teach _her_ something, was easy.
“But you don’t do it,” soliloquised the Billickin; “I am not your
pupil, whatever she,” meaning Rosa, “may be, poor thing!”

‘At what?’

‘I’ll take care, sir,’ said Kit.  ‘Thankee, sir, and good morning.’

"O man, man, man!" I says, and I went on my knees beside the bed; "if
your heart is rent asunder and you are truly penitent for what you did,
Our Saviour will have mercy on you yet!"

‘Handford then,’ suggested Bella.

‘Let us walk,’ whispered Lightwood, ‘and give this fellow time to think
of it.’

Sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene, that he
suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded. It
was not until it had been twice repeated, each time in a shriller tone,
that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour.

"Excellent property that, Sir," observed Mr. Britain.

Mrs. Squeers, when excited, was accustomed to use strong language, and,
moreover, to make use of a plurality of epithets, some of which were of
a figurative kind, as the word peacock, and furthermore the allusion
to Nicholas’s nose, which was not intended to be taken in its literal
sense, but rather to bear a latitude of construction according to the
fancy of the hearers.

I did not venture to controvert this opinion, but I made a good supper,
which it greatly satisfied her to see me do. When the table was cleared,
Janet assisted her to arrange her hair, to put on her nightcap, which
was of a smarter construction than usual (‘in case of fire’, my aunt
said), and to fold her gown back over her knees, these being her usual
preparations for warming herself before going to bed. I then made her,
according to certain established regulations from which no deviation,
however slight, could ever be permitted, a glass of hot wine and
water, and a slice of toast cut into long thin strips. With these
accompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening, my aunt sitting
opposite to me drinking her wine and water; soaking her strips of toast
in it, one by one, before eating them; and looking benignantly on me,
from among the borders of her nightcap.

“I wish you’d let me bleed you,” said Mr. Benjamin with great eagerness.

"Thinking of the fields," the turnkey said once, after watching her,
"ain't you?"

P.S.--Your paper is remarkably good. There is not the least doubt that
you can write constantly for A. Y. R. I am very pleased with it.

‘Don’t you think you have lived here long enough without paying any rent?
Don’t you think that, without any money, you’ve been a pretty constant
customer at this shop, now?’ said Mr. Tugby.

‘Here am I, Mister,’ said a voice from one of the ladders, which a pair
of clumsy feet descended briskly.  ‘It’s all done now.  Clear away, gals.
Everything shall be ready for you in half a minute, Mister.’

The same gentleman, also, synonymizes her with another element:

"Sir, I have company there," returned Riah hesitating, "but will you
please come up and see them?"

Chapter 13

“That’s all,” said Mr Dombey, resuming his letters. “You will explain
to him in good time about the usual outfit and so forth, Carker, of
course. He needn’t wait, Carker.”

CHAPTER 22

‘Ah!’ said the gentleman.  ‘Well?’

She gave Florence her ready promise, about her new room, and said she
would give directions about it herself. She then asked some questions
concerning poor Paul; and when they had sat in conversation for some
time, told Florence she had come to take her to her own home.

"To say to me--" he prompted.

‘I thought it best myself that I should be sent away, for I felt very
uncertain whether you would like to find me here.’

“‘Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London, and when you are old
you will never depart from it,’” interposed the Captain. “Wal”r!
Overhaul the book, my lad.”

I felt the blood rush into my face for the first time, but it was
only an instantaneous emotion. I turned my head aside, and it was
gone.

The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throat
again, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard
were ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough
stakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a
crew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or
interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or
spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,
“Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the
light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from
the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark. Cribbed and barred and
moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes
to be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we
saw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches
were flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over
with him.

The secretary drooped his head with an expression of perfect
acquiescence in anything that had been said or might be; and Lord George
gradually sinking down upon his pillow, fell asleep.

‘None o’ that, I say, young feller,’ repeated Sam firmly. ‘No man serves
him but me. And now we’re upon it, I’ll let you into another secret
besides that,’ said Sam, as he paid for the beer. ‘I never heerd, mind
you, or read of in story-books, nor see in picters, any angel in tights
and gaiters--not even in spectacles, as I remember, though that may ha’
been done for anythin’ I know to the contrairey--but mark my vords, Job
Trotter, he’s a reg’lar thoroughbred angel for all that; and let me see
the man as wenturs to tell me he knows a better vun.’ With this
defiance, Mr. Weller buttoned up his change in a side pocket, and, with
many confirmatory nods and gestures by the way, proceeded in search of
the subject of discourse.

[Illustration: "I'M GOING UP," OBSERVED THE DRIVER; "HOUNSLOW, TEN MILES
THIS SIDE LONDON"--Chap. xiii.]

SCR. What foul and obscure place is this? What place of bad repute--of
houses wretched--of people half naked--drunken and ill-favoured? The
whole quarter reeks with crime--with filth and misery. (_Shop door
opens, and MRS. DIBLER enters. She has hardly time to close the door
when it opens again, and DARK SAM enters closely followed by MRS.
MILDEW. Upon perceiving each other they at first start, but presently
burst into a laugh. JOE joins them._)

‘My only wish, Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘was to bring this very
unpleasant matter to as speedy a close as possible.’

“Do you know my—guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma’am?” I asked after a good
deal of hesitation.

With these words Mr. Weller re-filled and re-lighted his pipe, and once
more summing up a meditative expression of countenance, continued as
follows:

"Nothing more," said the child.  "Shall I go to him again to-morrow,
dear grandfather? Very early?  I will be there and back before
breakfast."

Gabriel resumed his seat, and looked wistfully up the road by which the
traveller had come; murmuring in a half whisper:

‘Tar, tar, Sammy,’ replied his father.

They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried
knocking at the door below.

"Is she?"

_Fred._ But why? Why?

‘“Never again, George; never again,” said the dying woman. “Let them lay
me by my poor boy now, but promise me, that if ever you leave this
dreadful place, and should grow rich, you will have us removed to some
quiet country churchyard, a long, long way off--very far from here--
where we can rest in peace. Dear George, promise me you will.”

“Truly yes, madame.”

Lightwood complied. Eugene, with a most pathetic struggle against the
unconsciousness that was coming over him, and with a look of appeal that
affected his friend profoundly, said:

‘There is nothing,’ said Annie, ‘that we have in common. I have long
found that there is nothing. If I were thankful to my husband for no
more, instead of for so much, I should be thankful to him for having
saved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart.’

“Ay, but that is not enough, and is not what I mean. For, Walter,”
added Florence, bursting into tears, “he liked you very much, and said
before he died that he was fond of you, and said ‘Remember Walter!’ and
if you’ll be a brother to me, Walter, now that he is gone and I have
none on earth, I’ll be your sister all my life, and think of you like
one wherever we may be! This is what I wished to say, dear Walter, but
I cannot say it as I would, because my heart is full.”

And not the less so, dear Felton, for having found some warm hearts, and
left some instalments of earnest and sincere affection, behind me on
this continent. And whenever I turn my mental telescope hitherward,
trust me that one of the first figures it will descry will wear
spectacles so like yours that the maker couldn't tell the difference,
and shall address a Greek class in such an exact imitation of your
voice, that the very students hearing it should cry, "That's he! Three
cheers. Hoo-ray-ay-ay-ay-ay!"

And so the little man was released off-hand; but he looked nothing the
less sad on that account, it being beyond the power of magistrate or
constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain, for they
concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself.
When this was done, and the man had gone his way, the night was found
to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search
before the next morning.

[Is it lawful--would that woman in the black gaiters, green veil, and
spectacles, hold it so--to send my love to the pretty M----?]

Sir Leicester begs to observe that wholly alters the case. He might
have been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in
support of her view. He entirely agrees with my Lady. The young woman
had better go.

I say, there I was, a-leaning over the bulwarks of the sloop Christopher
Columbus in the South American waters off the Mosquito shore: a subject
of his Gracious Majesty King George of England, and a private in the
Royal Marines.

Not confining himself to theory, or permitting his faculties to rust,
even at that early age, in mere abstract speculations, this promising
lad commenced usurer on a limited scale at school; putting out at good
interest a small capital of slate-pencil and marbles, and gradually
extending his operations until they aspired to the copper coinage of
this realm, in which he speculated to considerable advantage. Nor did
he trouble his borrowers with abstract calculations of figures, or
references to ready-reckoners; his simple rule of interest being all
comprised in the one golden sentence, ‘two-pence for every half-penny,’
which greatly simplified the accounts, and which, as a familiar precept,
more easily acquired and retained in the memory than any known rule
of arithmetic, cannot be too strongly recommended to the notice of
capitalists, both large and small, and more especially of money-brokers
and bill-discounters. Indeed, to do these gentlemen justice, many of
them are to this day in the frequent habit of adopting it, with eminent
success.

‘I believe I am!’ said Tip, sarcastically. ‘About! But not in your way.
I belong to the shop, only my sister has a theory that our governor must
never know it. I don’t see why, myself.’

‘Where?  Why, in my own bed at Bounderby’s.’

"Theer!" said Mr. Peggotty, cheerily. "Theer we are, Missis Gummidge!"
Mrs. Gummidge slightly groaned. "Lighted up, accordin' to custom! You're
a wonderin' what that's fur, sir! Well, it's fur our little Em'ly. You
see, the path ain't over light or cheerful arter dark; and when I'm here
at the hour as she's a comin' home, I puts the light in the winder.
That, you see," said Mr. Peggotty, bending over me with great glee,
"meets two objects. She says, says Em'ly, 'Theer's home!' she says. And
likewise, says Em'ly, 'My uncle's theer!' Fur if I ain't theer, I never
have no light showed."

‘You may rest assured,’ said I, ‘that they would have regretted your
doing so very much, for they are quite attached to them.’

She raised her eyes, and clasped her hands, and looked as beautiful and
true, I thought, as any Spirit. The Doctor looked on her, henceforth, as
steadfastly as she on him.

‘In what?’ asked Mr Chuzzlewit.

_Scro._ Spirit! I see, I see. This is my own case, if nothing happens to
change it. My life tends this way. Spirit, in leaving this. I shall not
leave its lesson; trust me. If there is any person in the city who feels
the least emotion for the death here announced, show that person to me.
[_Crosses to_ L., _while scene closes in_.]

It is scarcely necessary for me to say, that our child had been expected.
In fact, it had been expected, with comparative confidence, for some
months.  Mrs. Meek’s mother, who resides with us—of the name of Bigby—had
made every preparation for its admission to our circle.

‘Hooroar!’ said Caleb with unusual vigour.  ‘My opinion!’

"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,"
said Scrooge.

‘Give me the money again,’ said the other, eagerly, ‘and I’ll keep it,
and never spend it. Thank you for it, thank you! I shall see you again?’

"I had supper long ago, but really I think I can take something more,"
said Mrs. Townsend, drawing her chair nearer to the table.

‘Besides,’ said she, ‘your digestion is nonsense. I don’t speak of your
digestion. I speak of your manner.’

I had the honor of being introduced to the old Marquis de B----.
In days of yore he had signalized himself by some small feats of
chivalry in the Cour d'Amour, and had dressed himself out to the
idea of tilts and tournaments ever since.  The Marquis de B----
wished to have it thought the affair was somewhere else than in his
brain.  "He could like to take a trip to England," and asked much
of the English ladies.  "Stay where you are, I beseech you,
Monsieur le Marquis," said I.  "Les Messieurs Anglais can scarce
get a kind look from them as it is."  The marquis invited me to
supper.

The bed was soon made ready; and the visitor, declining all refreshment
but a cup of tea, retired.  Then, Dot—quite well again, she said, quite
well again—arranged the great chair in the chimney-corner for her
husband; filled his pipe and gave it him; and took her usual little stool
beside him on the hearth.

On further consideration this appeared so likely, that I abandoned
my scheme, which had had a more promising appearance in words than in
action; resolving henceforth to be satisfied with my child-wife, and to
try to change her into nothing else by any process. I was heartily tired
of being sagacious and prudent by myself, and of seeing my darling under
restraint; so I bought a pretty pair of ear-rings for her, and a collar
for Jip, and went home one day to make myself agreeable.

After this I held my tongue. Presently my friend again inquired whether
I was going up to Court?

Having preferred these moderate requests, Mrs Gamp observed that she
would stand at the door until the order was executed, to the end that
the patient might not be disturbed by her opening it a second time; and
therefore she would thank the young woman to ‘look sharp.’

[Illustration: STANDING BEFORE THE DRESSING-GLASS WAS A MIDDLE-AGED LADY
IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS, BUSILY ENGAGED IN BRUSHING WHAT LADIES CALL THEIR
"BACK HAIR"--Chap. xxii.]

“Oh! what is to be done?” cried Rose. “Dear, dear! why did they send
for these people?”

"Is that you, Peggotty, dear?"

F. W.

So, she drew her arm through Mr. Peggotty’s, and walked with him to a
leafy little summer-house there was at the bottom of the garden, where
she sat down on a bench, and I beside her. There was a seat for Mr.
Peggotty too, but he preferred to stand, leaning his hand on the small
rustic table. As he stood, looking at his cap for a little while before
beginning to speak, I could not help observing what power and force
of character his sinewy hand expressed, and what a good and trusty
companion it was to his honest brow and iron-grey hair.

When I had remained at the window nearly an hour, I saw an
aide-de-camp ride under the gateway of our house. He sent to enquire
where Sir William was dining. I wrote down the name; and soon after I
saw him gallop off in that direction. I did not like this appearance,
but I tried not to be afraid. A few minutes after, I saw Sir William
on the same horse gallop past to the Duke's,(4) which was a few doors
beyond ours. He dismounted and ran into the house--left the horse in
the middle of the street. I must confess my courage failed me now, and
the succeeding two hours formed a contrast to the happy forenoon.

The doctor vowed with extended hand he would move into it the very next
day, in spite of wind, frost, and snow.

Mr. Pott darted a look of contempt, which might have withered an anchor.

‘Ha! Mr Meagles’s friend!’ exclaimed that public criminal, coming out of
some mental combinations he had been making, and offering his hand. ‘I
am glad to see you, sir. Will you excuse me if I forget your name?’

“Wud of Bister Fagid’s lads,” exclaimed Barney, with a grin.

‘No, no; I mean the others,’ said the bewildered Winkle.

“Aye! And not so old either, five and thirty years ago,” says Mr.
George. “But I’ll wager that at ninety she would be near as upright
as me, and near as broad across the shoulders.”

Mother, with a look which thanked Clennam in a manner very agreeable to
him, answered that it was indeed.

“Poor fellow!” said Mrs. Sowerberry, looking piteously on the
charity-boy.

“Too true.”

"I'll tell you what it is, young boa-constructer," said Mr. Weller,
impressively; "if you don't sleep a little less, and exercise a little
more, ven you come to be a man you'll lay yourself open to the same
sort of personal inconwenience as was inflicted on the old gen'l'm'n as
wore the pigtail."

“My good lady,” returned my guardian, “it is hardly reasonable to ask
me to get out of my own room.”

‘You are mocking me, sir,’ replied Mrs. Nickleby, making a feint of
retreating towards the house.

I answered that I had thought it was later. Not that I had really
thought so, but because my conversational powers were effectually
scattered.

‘Good,’ said Ralph; ‘a very few words will be sufficient here. You had a
son by your first wife, Mr. Snawley?’

‘Now,’ said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle
of a bedroom-door, ‘let us hear what you think of him. He has
not been shaved very recently, but he don’t look at all ferocious
notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in
visiting order.’

Some dark specks in the snow, like knots upon a little thread, beginning
at the convent door and winding away down the descent in broken lengths
which were not yet pieced together, showed where the Brethren were at
work in several places clearing the track. Already the snow had begun to
be foot-thawed again about the door. Mules were busily brought out, tied
to the rings in the wall, and laden; strings of bells were buckled
on, burdens were adjusted, the voices of drivers and riders sounded
musically. Some of the earliest had even already resumed their journey;
and, both on the level summit by the dark water near the convent, and on
the downward way of yesterday’s ascent, little moving figures of men and
mules, reduced to miniatures by the immensity around, went with a clear
tinkling of bells and a pleasant harmony of tongues.

_Scro._ Nothing, particular.

"Jenny!" said the landlord, with the same gravity as before, "go with
the young gentleman to the pump in the back kitchen, and take a clean
towel along with you."

She sunk down gently at the Doctor's feet, though he did his utmost to
prevent her; and said, looking up, tearfully, into his face:

Fagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of
Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.

While she was thus engaged, the merry little man looked at her with an
interest which did not appear to be diminished when he glanced at her
helpless companion.  When she had finished her work he thanked her, and
inquired whither they were travelling.

"I love you, Floy," he said one day to her.

“Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a
watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of
clothes.

In all that month’s time, I never saw anyone go into the House nor come
out of the House.  I supposed that such a thing must take place
sometimes, in the dead of the night, or the glimmer of the morning; but,
I never saw it done.  I got no relief from having my curtains drawn when
it came on dark, and shutting out the House.  The Eye then began to shine
in my fire.

‘Just his old way!’ cried Chuffey, looking up into his face. ‘I almost
believe it’s Mr Chuzzlewit alive again. Yes! Take me with you! Stay,
though, stay.’

Fagin nodded yes.

II.
    My patron! most noble!
      Of highest degree!
    Thou never canst probe all
      My homage for thee!
    Thy hand--oh! I'd lick it,
      Though often rebuff'd;
    And still I am "Riquet,"
      The man with the Tuft!

‘Thank you Sir, I must be going directly.’

But, when he looked among the images in iron, marble, bronze, and brass,
he failed to find a rather meritorious countryman of his, once the son of
a Warwickshire wool-dealer, or any single countryman whomsoever of that
kind.  He could find none of the men whose knowledge had rescued him and
his children from terrific and disfiguring disease, whose boldness had
raised his forefathers from the condition of serfs, whose wise fancy had
opened a new and high existence to the humblest, whose skill had filled
the working man’s world with accumulated wonders.  Whereas, he did find
others whom he knew no good of, and even others whom he knew much ill of.

“Miss Floy,” said Susan Nipper, “is the most devoted and most patient
and most dutiful and beautiful of daughters, there ain’t no gentleman,
no Sir, though as great and rich as all the greatest and richest of
England put together, but might be proud of her and would and ought. If
he knew her value right, he’d rather lose his greatness and his fortune
piece by piece and beg his way in rags from door to door, I say to some
and all, he would!” cried Susan Nipper, bursting into tears, “than
bring the sorrow on her tender heart that I have seen it suffer in this
house!”

By this time a carriage has driven up to convey the bride to church,
and Anne of number six prolonging the process of ‘cleaning her door,’
has the satisfaction of beholding the bride and bridesmaids, and the
papa and mamma, hurry into the same and drive rapidly off. Nor is this
all, for soon other carriages begin to arrive with a posse of company
all beautifully dressed, at whom she could stand and gaze for ever; but
having something else to do, is compelled to take one last long look
and shut the street-door.

He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to
Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining
with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he
had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the
housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his purpose
could be engaged. He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had
suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change
very severely. He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and
then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book
which the Jew had left with him, began to read.

‘Now, then!’ said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head
in at the door, ‘what do you want, young man?’

‘Look here, sir,’ said Bella; ‘when your lovely woman marries, you shall
have that piece if you like, and she’ll make you a chain of it. Would
you prize that remembrance of the dear creature?’

"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one, at the
corner?" Scrooge inquired.

I will be at Tavistock House at twelve on Saturday, and then will wait
for you until I see you. If we return together--as I hope we shall--our
express will start at half-past four, and we ought to dine (somewhere
about Temple Bar) at three.

"And by the blessing of Heaven, my friends, one and all," cried the
captain, radiant with joy,--"of the Heaven that put it into this Tom
Pettifer's head to take so much care of his head against the bright
sun,--he lined his hat with the original leaf in Tregarthen's
writing,--and here it is!"

“And to talk about birdcages, too!” whimpered the Grinder. “As if that
was a crime! Why, look’ee here! Do you know who this belongs to?”

‘Well,’ said Lord Frederick, sipping his first glass of port, ‘if this
is a discounting dinner, all I have to say is, deyvle take me, if it
wouldn’t be a good pla-an to get discount every day.’

"Yes. He met it coming out of the town as he was entering early. The
men are travelling on foot, and rested there last night; and as it was
Marion's birth-day, and he thought it would please her, he sent them on,
with a pencilled note to me, saying that if I thought so too, they had
come to serenade her."

“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn’t
lend money to any of us if we wanted it.”

In the Borough especially, there still remain some half-dozen old inns,
which have preserved their external features unchanged, and which have
escaped alike the rage for public improvement, and the encroachments
of private speculation. Great, rambling, queer old places they are,
with galleries, and passages, and staircases wide enough and antiquated
enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories, supposing we
should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any,
and that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable
veracious legends connected with old London Bridge, and its adjacent
neighbourhood on the Surrey side.

49, CHAMPS ELYSÉES, _Saturday, Jan. 19th, 1856._

With that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye, surveyed his
company with his loose one, kissed her, shook his head, and handed her to
Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse.

The voices in the waves speak low to him of Florence, day and
night—plainest when he, his blooming daughter, and her husband, beside
them in the evening, or sit at an open window, listening to their roar.
They speak to him of Florence and his altered heart; of Florence and
their ceaseless murmuring to her of the love, eternal and illimitable,
extending still, beyond the sea, beyond the sky, to the invisible
country far away.

It appeared, on their drawing up at the family gate, that to try
Wilfer’s was a thing more easily projected than done, on account of the
extreme difficulty of getting into that establishment; three pulls
at the bell producing no external result; though each was attended
by audible sounds of scampering and rushing within. At the fourth
tug—vindictively administered by the hammer-headed young man—Miss
Lavinia appeared, emerging from the house in an accidental manner, with
a bonnet and parasol, as designing to take a contemplative walk. The
young lady was astonished to find visitors at the gate, and expressed
her feelings in appropriate action.

And so when the Queen was going to get up in the morning, she said, "O,
dear me, dear me; my head, my head!" and then she fainted away.

‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, rising with one of his thumbs
in each of his waistcoat pockets, ‘the companion of my youth: if I may
be allowed the expression--and my esteemed friend Traddles: if I may be
permitted to call him so--will allow me, on the part of Mrs. Micawber,
myself, and our offspring, to thank them in the warmest and most
uncompromising terms for their good wishes. It may be expected that
on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new
existence,’ Mr. Micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred
thousand miles, ‘I should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such
friends as I see before me. But all that I have to say in this way, I
have said. Whatever station in society I may attain, through the medium
of the learned profession of which I am about to become an unworthy
member, I shall endeavour not to disgrace, and Mrs. Micawber will be
safe to adorn. Under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities,
contracted with a view to their immediate liquidation, but remaining
unliquidated through a combination of circumstances, I have been
under the necessity of assuming a garb from which my natural instincts
recoil--I allude to spectacles--and possessing myself of a cognomen, to
which I can establish no legitimate pretensions. All I have to say on
that score is, that the cloud has passed from the dreary scene, and the
God of Day is once more high upon the mountain tops. On Monday next, on
the arrival of the four o’clock afternoon coach at Canterbury, my foot
will be on my native heath--my name, Micawber!’

Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two
companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened
across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the
roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,
leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of
lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,
which shook the crazy building to its centre.

“Yes, I do.”

‘Good God, how small he is!’ cried the amiable uncle, starting back
with well-feigned surprise; ‘_remarkably_ small indeed.’

‘“I don’t believe it,” says the baron.

‘In where, miss?’

Nevertheless, the brave little creature did so fix her heart on her
brother's rescue, that while he was ringing out these doleful changes,
she pinched and scraped enough together to ship him for Canada.  When he
was tired of nothing to do, and disposed in its turn to cut even that,
he graciously consented to go to Canada.  And there was grief in her
bosom over parting with him, and joy in the hope of his being put in a
straight course at last.

“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious
Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!”

One sing'ler idea he had in that Ed of his, which must have meant
something, or it wouldn't have been there.  It was always his opinion
that he was entitled to property.  He never would put his name to
anything.  He had been taught to write, by the young man without arms,
who got his living with his toes (quite a writing master _he_ was, and
taught scores in the line), but Chops would have starved to death, afore
he'd have gained a bit of bread by putting his hand to a paper.  This is
the more curious to bear in mind, because HE had no property, nor hope of
property, except his house and a sarser.  When I say his house, I mean
the box, painted and got up outside like a reg'lar six-roomer, that he
used to creep into, with a diamond ring (or quite as good to look at) on
his forefinger, and ring a little bell out of what the Public believed to
be the Drawing-room winder.  And when I say a sarser, I mean a Chaney
sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end of every
Entertainment.  His cue for that, he took from me: "Ladies and gentlemen,
the little man will now walk three times round the Cairawan, and retire
behind the curtain."  When he said anything important, in private life,
he mostly wound it up with this form of words, and they was generally the
last thing he said to me at night afore he went to bed.

A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT

"Yes, sir," replied Noah; "and, please sir, missis wants to know whether
Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there directly, and flog him,
'cause master's out."

“And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,” said
The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the
street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”

_Tom._ So restless wild--

The infamous ---- says the stoves shall be fixed to-morrow.

"'Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
                The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep,'

“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself
with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
Court; let him see them on Sunday.”

‘I came round to him in time,’ said Mr. Lillyvick. ‘After they were
married, and there was no help for it, I was one of the first to say
that Kenwigs must be taken notice of. The family DID take notice of him,
in consequence, and on my representation; and I am bound to say--and
proud to say--that I have always found him a very honest, well-behaved,
upright, respectable sort of man. Kenwigs, shake hands.’

But better thoughts succeeded: her breast heaved as she read and
re-read the singular passage concerning the Prussian autograph, who had
planted his standard at Venice. "I knew it!" she cried, "I knew it!--he
is of noble race! O Roderick, I will perish, but I will help thee!"

“Now, you know,” said Mr. Grewgious, “_I_ couldn’t write a play.”

“Not a drop. Nor a drop,” said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a
dignified, but placid manner.

In good time the Major, previously instructed by Mrs Pipchin, spied out
Paul and Florence, and bore down upon them; there being a stately
gentleman (Mr Dombey, doubtless) in their company. Charging with Master
Bitherstone into the very heart of the little squadron, it fell out, of
course, that Master Bitherstone spoke to his fellow-sufferers. Upon
that the Major stopped to notice and admire them; remembered with
amazement that he had seen and spoken to them at his friend Miss Tox’s
in Princess’s Place; opined that Paul was a devilish fine fellow, and
his own little friend; inquired if he remembered Joey B. the Major; and
finally, with a sudden recollection of the conventionalities of life,
turned and apologised to Mr Dombey.

“Ah! You are so white, George—for you—and look so shocked. Now
don’t he, Lignum?”

She parted tenderly from Ruth, who with her brother was in the act of
leaving the room, when a key was heard in the lock of the door below,
and immediately afterwards a quick footstep in the passage. Tom stopped,
and looked at Merry.

‘At an early hour this morning the bells of all the churches struck
seven o’clock; the effect of which, in the present lively state of the
town, was extremely singular. While I was at breakfast, a yellow gig,
drawn by a dark grey horse, with a patch of white over his right
eyelid, proceeded at a rapid pace in the direction of the Original Pig
stables; it is currently reported that this gentleman has arrived here
for the purpose of attending the association, and, from what I have
heard, I consider it extremely probable, although nothing decisive is
yet known regarding him. You may conceive the anxiety with which we are
all looking forward to the arrival of the four o’clock coach this
afternoon.

On being asked if it were he who had once rented the House to Let,
Grizzled Velveteen looked surprised, and said yes. Then his name was
Magsman. That was it, Toby Magsman,--which was lawfully christened
Robert; but called in the line, from an infant, Toby. There was nothing
agin Toby Magsman, he believed? If there was suspicion of such, mention
it!

[Illustration: 0306]

I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we
talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took
him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,
and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife
of the Above.

Dot's whole attention had been concentrated, during this discourse, upon
the father and daughter; but looking, now, towards the little Hay-maker
in the Moorish meadow, she saw that the clock was within a few minutes
of striking, and fell, immediately, into a nervous and excited state.

"And what's Pax to be?" asked Dora; "for you know he will come if Darkie
does, and he'll run in before everybody else too."

‘My father!’ said poor Joe; adding under his breath, with a very
unfilial apostrophe, ‘Will he never think me man enough to take care of
myself!’

‘You sleep here to-night, and go on in the morning, I suppose, ma’am?’
said Martin.

Almost broken-hearted, Nell withdrew with the schoolmaster from the
bedside and returned to his cottage.  In the midst of her grief and
tears she was yet careful to conceal their real cause from the old man,
for the dead boy had been a grandchild, and left but one aged relative
to mourn his premature decay.

‘Boots,’ said the gentleman.

Fanny had, in Isabel’s absence, folded Thomas’ shawl, and hung it across
her arm. “I thought, Miss,” answered she, blushing, “that I might just
carry it to show Thomas that I did not forget his present, or think it
too homely to go to church with me.”

Next came Miss Duff, in a light pea-green plush,
    That beautifully show'd her blue-red blush.
    Miss Reeves soon follow'd, spite of summer weather,
    In pelerine of goose-down, and a feather.
    The two Miss Gallaghers, the four Miss Bradys,
    With I know not how many other ladies.
    Amongst them Nelly Jones, with her first child,
    That squeak'd and squall'd; then, cock-a-doodle, smiled.
    Reader! I tell this for your private list'ning,
    To have the clargy at his feast, a christ'ning
    Our Darby thought would be a trick with art in
    To _nail_ the presence of big Father Martin,
    Who was the _bochel-bhui_ of jolly sinners,
    At wakes or christ'nings, weddings, deaths, or dinners!
    Suppose Jack Falstaff had ta'en holy orders,
    And then I'll say your fancy somewhat borders
    Upon the plumpy truth of this round priest,
    Who ne'er refus'd his blessing to a feast.

‘And he could not prove them,’ said the red-faced man, looking round
triumphantly; ‘and the borough didn’t have him; and if you carried this
principle to the full extent, you’d have no debt, no pensions, no
sinecures, no negroes, no nothing. And then, standing upon an elevation
of intellectual attainment, and having reached the summit of popular
prosperity, you might bid defiance to the nations of the earth, and
erect yourselves in the proud confidence of wisdom and superiority.
This is my argument—this always has been my argument—and if I was a
Member of the House of Commons to-morrow, I’d make ’em shake in their
shoes with it. And the red-faced man, having struck the table very hard
with his clenched fist, to add weight to the declaration, smoked away
like a brewery.

‘I was her father!  I was her father!’ cried the old man, stretching out
his hands to the dark shadows flying on above.  ‘Have mercy on her, and
on me!  Where does she go?  Turn her back!  I was her father!’

‘And what have I heard! What have I heard!’ cried Rose. ‘That a
sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that
he shunned all--there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said
enough.’

‘She’s dead,’ replied Oliver; ‘don’t you say anything about her to
me!’

Little Dombey's mother died when he was born, but the event did not
greatly disturb Mr. Dombey; and since his son lived, what did it matter
to him that his little daughter Florence was breaking her heart in
loneliness for the mother who had loved and cherished her!

"How can you help it?"--"I'll soother him."

A RESPECTED FRIEND IN A NEW ASPECT

‘Tut! Let us have done with that. WE know very well how it was. Why
should you and I talk about it, when you and I can’t disguise it? To
proceed. I am disappointed and cut a poor figure.’

At the same time, too, he told the people at the Assurance Office, in
his own mysterious way, that there was something wrong (secretly wrong,
of course) in his liver, and that he feared he must put himself
under the doctor’s hands. He was delivered over to Jobling upon this
representation; and though Jobling could not find out where his liver
was wrong, wrong Mr Nadgett said it was; observing that it was his
own liver, and he hoped he ought to know. Accordingly, he became Mr
Jobling’s patient; and detailing his symptoms in his slow and secret
way, was in and out of that gentleman’s room a dozen times a day.

As they gave the answer, they recalled their outstretched hands; and
where their figures had been, there the Bells were.

CHAPTER XXI -- THE EXPEDITION

“It is so,” assented Defarge once more.

“Well! I’ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,” said Stryver,
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to
be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in a woman’s society, than you do.”

‘All right?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick, with an inward presentiment that it
was all wrong.

Although I was deeply interested in this dialogue, I could not help
observing my aunt, Mr. Dick, and Janet, while it was in progress, and
completing a survey I had already been engaged in making of the room.

“And nothing to do, Rob?”

“A thousand thanks for a curious and interesting night,” says Jasper,
giving him his hand; “you can make your own way home?”

By this time I began to fear that my friends would be rendered impatient
by my protracted absence.  I therefore begged Mr. Pickwick to accompany
me up-stairs, and left the two Mr. Wellers in the care of the
housekeeper, laying strict injunctions upon her to treat them with all
possible hospitality.

Spelling and hyphenation show many inconsistencies, but these have been
left as printed, unless obvious slips.

‘If you please, sir,’ said Oliver.

‘So all I’ve come about, is jest this here,’ said Sam, disregarding the
interruption; ‘first, to give my governor’s notice--there it is.
Secondly, to pay the rent--here it is. Thirdly, to say as all his things
is to be put together, and give to anybody as we sends for ‘em.
Fourthly, that you may let the place as soon as you like--and that’s
all.’

The report of this adventure entertained the town for nine days; but
on the tenth, through the patronage of his protectresses, Dulcet was
dubbed a knight, and soon after married a cheesemonger's daughter, ugly
enough to have a hereditary claim to virtue; but who possessed an ample
fortune, and was most anxious to become a lady.

‘How can I help it, Margaret?  What am I to do?  She has been to me
again!’

‘Our old selves wouldn’t do here, old lady. Haven’t you found that out
yet? Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and
imposed upon. Our old selves weren’t people of fortune; our new selves
are; it’s a great difference.’

‘If you think them pretty, say I may always stop, and see you write!’
said Dora. ‘Do you think them pretty?’

Some said one thing, some another, and some only groaned and hissed. It
being now nearly dark, and the house high, many persons in the throng
were not aware that any one had come to answer them, and continued their
clamour until the intelligence was gradually diffused through the whole
concourse. Ten minutes or more elapsed before any one voice could be
heard with tolerable distinctness; during which interval the figure
remained perched alone, against the summer-evening sky, looking down
into the troubled street.

At this high point, Miss Knag’s friendship remained for three whole
days, much to the wonderment of Madame Mantalini’s young ladies who had
never beheld such constancy in that quarter, before; but on the fourth,
it received a check no less violent than sudden, which thus occurred.

‘No, no,’ resumed Mr Pecksniff, chafing the captive hand reproachfully,
‘of virtue--have enabled me to set such guards upon myself, that it
is really difficult to ruffle me. It is a curious fact, but it is
difficult, do you know, for any one to ruffle me. And did she think,’
said Mr Pecksniff, with a playful tightening of his grasp ‘that SHE
could! How little did she know his heart!’

It was pretty late in the autumn of the year, when the declining sun
struggling through the mist which had obscured it all day, looked
brightly down upon a little Wiltshire village, within an easy journey of
the fair old town of Salisbury.

Mrs. Nickleby surmised, however, that perhaps the counting-house was
burnt down, or perhaps ‘the Mr. Cheerybles’ had sent to take Nicholas
into partnership (which certainly appeared highly probable at that time
of night), or perhaps Mr. Linkinwater had run away with the property, or
perhaps Miss La Creevy was taken in, or perhaps--

“And you know,” said Rosa innocently, “you couldn’t like me then; and
you can always like me now, for I shall not be a drag upon you, or a
worry to you. And I can always like you now, and your sister will not
tease or trifle with you. I often did when I was not your sister, and I
beg your pardon for it.”

"Oh! various, various, my dear squire," said Murphy; "but I don't see
any great use in doing so _yet_,--he has not openly avowed himself."

All this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the
threshold--child-like, according to my theory--and then Peggotty opened
a little door and showed me my bedroom. It was the completest and most
desirable bedroom ever seen--in the stern of the vessel; with a little
window, where the rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass,
just the right height for me, nailed against the wall, and framed with
oyster-shells; a little bed, which there was just room enough to get
into; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table. The walls
were whitewashed as white as milk, and the patchwork counterpane made my
eyes quite ache with its brightness. One thing I particularly noticed
in this delightful house, was the smell of fish; which was so searching,
that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose, I found it
smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster. On my imparting this
discovery in confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother
dealt in lobsters, crabs, and crawfish; and I afterwards found that a
heap of these creatures, in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one
another, and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of,
were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and
kettles were kept.

The gentleman held their peace, and smiled at each other, as who should
say, ‘Well! there’s no accounting for tastes;’ but the ladies resolved
unanimously that Nicholas had an aristocratic air; and nobody caring to
dispute the position, it was established triumphantly.

One summer afternoon; a year, wanting some odd days, after the marriage
in the City church; there was a buzz and whisper upon “Change of a
great failure. A certain cold proud man, well known there, was not
there, nor was he represented there. Next day it was noised abroad that
Dombey and Son had stopped, and next night there was a List of
Bankrupts published, headed by that name.

‘I would willingly obey you in anything, Miss Scarve,’ replied
Randulph; ‘but in this case it is not in my power. Farewell!’ Fixing one
passionate look upon her, he then bowed haughtily to Sir Norfolk, who
returned his salutation in kind, and withdrew.

Yours ever affectionately.

"So I found," said Mr. Wickfield. "I couldn't doubt it, when you told me
so. But I thought--I implore you to remember the narrow construction
which has been my besetting sin--that, in a case where there was so much
disparity in point of years--"

“Only through me,” rejoined Mr. Bumble.

‘Who said he was to have six pound a year?’ said Quilp, looking sharply
round.  ‘Did the old man say it, or did little Nell say it?  And what’s
he to have it for, and where are they, eh!’

‘Well, then, my love, I wish you would keep your foolish fancy to
yourself, and not wake up MY foolish fancy to keep it company,’ retorted
Mrs. Nickleby. ‘Why didn’t you think of all this before--you are so
careless--we might have asked Miss La Creevy to keep us company or
borrowed a dog, or a thousand things--but it always was the way, and
was just the same with your poor dear father. Unless I thought of
everything--’ This was Mrs. Nickleby’s usual commencement of a general
lamentation, running through a dozen or so of complicated sentences
addressed to nobody in particular, and into which she now launched until
her breath was exhausted.

“But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of
way?” said Mr. Jarndyce. “You are not free from the toils of the law
yourself!”

“My love,” said Richard, “there is no one with whom I have a greater
wish to talk than you, for I want you to understand me.”

"Very good, Captain Maryon," says Pordage, in a tremendous passion.  "Very
good, sir.  Be the consequences on your own head!  Mr. Kitten, as it has
come to this, help me on with it."

Chapter 6

He fell away into a weakness so extreme that he could not raise his
hand. But he still protected his brother according to his long usage;
and would say with some complacency, fifty times a day, when he saw him
standing by his bed, ‘My good Frederick, sit down. You are very feeble
indeed.’

‘I’m a devil!’ rejoined the raven promptly.

‘The same mistake presents itself to me, in one shape or other, at
every turn,’ said brother Charles. ‘Parents who never showed their love,
complain of want of natural affection in their children; children who
never showed their duty, complain of want of natural feeling in their
parents; law-makers who find both so miserable that their affections
have never had enough of life’s sun to develop them, are loud in their
moralisings over parents and children too, and cry that the very ties of
nature are disregarded. Natural affections and instincts, my dear sir,
are the most beautiful of the Almighty’s works, but like other beautiful
works of His, they must be reared and fostered, or it is as natural that
they should be wholly obscured, and that new feelings should usurp
their place, as it is that the sweetest productions of the earth, left
untended, should be choked with weeds and briers. I wish we could be
brought to consider this, and remembering natural obligations a little
more at the right time, talk about them a little less at the wrong one.’

"Will you go away?  I have a gun in here," said the Hermit.

We were now in the street.

‘Not at all--by no means,’ replied the unabashed Mr. Jingle--‘overheard
the tale--came to warn you of your danger--tender my services--prevent
the hubbub. Never mind--think it an insult--leave the room’--and he
turned, as if to carry the threat into execution.

“As you would have had with that delightful good soul—what did they
call him?—Granger—if he hadn’t died. And who have you to thank for all
this, Edith?”

Rob produced a bundle of keys. The Captain surveyed them, remained in
his corner, and surveyed the messenger.

Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed:

Mr. Sharpeye further intimates that when we have done with his services,
he will step back and take that young man.  Which in course of time he
does: feeling at perfect ease about finding him, and knowing for a moral
certainty that nobody in that region will be gone to bed.

"Open another," said Villon. "How do you ever hope to fill that big
hogshead, your body, with little things like bottles? And how do you
expect to get to heaven? How many angels, do you fancy, can be spared
to carry up a single monk from Picardy? Or do you think yourself
another Elias--and they'll send the coach for you?"

In the fervour of this impression, I congratulated Mr. Micawber on the
treasure he possessed. So did Traddles. Mr. Micawber extended his
hand to each of us in succession, and then covered his face with his
pocket-handkerchief, which I think had more snuff upon it than he
was aware of. He then returned to the punch, in the highest state of
exhilaration.

‘More than I can say myself at any rate,’ returned Flora, ‘for I might
have been dead and buried twenty distinct times over and no doubt
whatever should have been before you had genuinely remembered Me or
anything like it in spite of which one last remark I wish to make, one
last explanation I wish to offer--’

"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!" said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. "But I
suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning!"

‘As a schoolmaster,’ said Eugene, ‘you are always being heard. That
ought to content you.’

‘This is a smash,’ observed Toby, biting his lips. ‘There’s more
than one will go with this.’

‘A bat might see that, with the sun shining,’ said Dick.

They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him,
and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her
so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one
ran against them.  Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him
while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.

The French officers gave the following account of the
expedition:--‘About eighteen days before, 1500 men, some of whom had
served under Bonaparte in Italy, the rest had been of the army of the
Rhine, embarked on board three frigates at Rochelle, and on a very dark
night eluded (beyond their expectation) the vigilance of the English
fleet, which was close behind them. Two of them had forty-four guns,
eighteen-pounders, the other thirty-eight guns, twelve-pounders. They
said also they brought nine pieces of cannon and arms for 100,000 men,
but this was French gasconnade, as they had arms only for 5500 men
and but two four-pounders. The meagre persons and the wan and sallow
countenances of these troops, whose numbers did not exceed 1060 rank and
file and 70 officers, strongly indicated the severe hardships which they
must have undergone.

Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was
trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and
a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.

‘Do you mean that Fledgeby has at all softened him towards you?’

‘To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?’ pursued the single
gentleman.

"They are, sir; that is, they are my master's. A strange place this,
sir," said he, looking at the stones; "ever here before?"

“I came for some marsh plants,” said the boy. “You and I got plenty once
somewhere hereabouts, but I cannot find them now.”

“Are you quite as well to-night? Your head is not so cool as in the
afternoon.”

‘“My love,” said the baron.

Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,
    And a staunch old heart has he.
    How closely he twineth, how tight he clings
    To his friend the huge Oak Tree!
    And slyly he traileth along the ground,
    And his leaves he gently waves,
    And he joyously hugs and crawleth round
    The rich mould of dead men's graves.
          Creeping where grim death has been,
          A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

‘And a bender,’ suggested the clerical gentleman.

‘Not at all.’

“Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before
witnesses?”

Mr. Peggotty, in simple earnestness, waved his right arm, as if he were
waving it at the town-lights for the last time, and then, exchanging a
nod with Ham, whose eye he caught, proceeded as before.

“Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,” submitted Mr. Bumble,
in a voice tremulous with fear: “_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,”
said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, “Mr. Monks is too
much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr.
Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a
little run to seed, as I may say; but he has heerd: I say I have no
doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined
officer, with very uncommon strength, if I’m once roused. I only want a
little rousing; that’s all.”

We had stopped in an empty doorway, while this was passing, and he had
stopped too.

“If I say what, you’ll go wrong again.”

Lansdowne, Lord, 32.

‘She has always been a sacred charge to me, Alfred.  She is doubly so,
now.  I will be faithful to my trust, believe me.’

"Eh?" said Mr. Magnus; and then he repeated the sneer with increased
effect. "But you shall answer it, sir."

They had three children, a boy and two girls. The boy was about eight
years of age; the girls were about five and six. These children were
taught their lessons of spelling and reading by the mother, amongst her
other multifarious tasks; for she was one of those who are called
regular plodders. She was quiet, patient, and always doing, though never
in a bustle. She was not one of those who acquire a character for vast
industry by doing everything in a mighty flurry, though they contrive to
find time for a tolerable deal of gossip under the plea of resting a
bit, and “which resting a bit” they always terminate by an exclamation
that “they must be off, though, for they have a world of work to do.”
Betty Dunster, on the contrary, was looked on as rather “a slow coach.”
If you remarked that she was a hard-working woman, the reply was, “Well,
she’s always doing--Betty’s work’s never done; but then she does na
hurry hersen.” The fact was, Betty was a thin, spare woman, of no very
strong constitution, but of an untiring spirit. Her pleasure and rest
were, when David came home at night, to have his supper ready, and to
sit down opposite to him at the little round table, and help him, giving
a bit now and then to the children, that came and stood round, though
they had had their suppers, and were ready for bed as soon as they had
seen something of their “dad.”

Pray tell the illustrious Philip van Artevelde, that I will deal with
the nefarious case in question if I can. I am a little doubtful of the
practicability of doing so, and frisking outside the bounds of the law
of libel. I have that high opinion of the law of England generally,
which one is likely to derive from the impression that it puts all the
honest men under the diabolical hoofs of all the scoundrels. It makes me
cautious of doing right; an admirable instance of its wisdom!

Somehow the execution of this little concerted piece appears to raise
the general spirits as with a sense of duty done, and sets the company a
going. Everybody seems more equal than before, to the calamity of being
in the society of everybody else. Even Eugene standing in a window,
moodily swinging the tassel of a blind, gives it a smarter jerk now, as
if he found himself in better case.

Pray understand that there is no end of men who would do it, and that if
you have the least objection to the trouble, I don't make this the
expression of a wish even. Otherwise, I would like you to be in the
scheme, which is a very great and important one, and which cannot have
too many men who are steadily--not flightily, like some of our
friends--in earnest, and who are not to be lightly discouraged.

Twemlow, having no lady assigned him, goes down in the rear, with
his hand to his forehead. Boots and Brewer, thinking him indisposed,
whisper, ‘Man faint. Had no lunch.’ But he is only stunned by the
unvanquishable difficulty of his existence.

There is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited
and uncomfortable--not for lack of society, for the prison was very
full, and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good-
fellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony of
introduction; but he was alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt the
depression of spirits and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on the
reflection that he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of
liberation. As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the
sharpness of Dodson & Fogg, it never for an instant entered his
thoughts.

“‘I write in the—;’ In the what’s this? What does he write in?”

As I have said, I never saw a more beautiful countenance, or one more
subdued to settled quiet. "Ailie," said James, "this is Maister John,
the young doctor; Rab's friend, ye ken. We often speak aboot you,
doctor." She smiled and made a movement, but said nothing, and
prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising. Had
Solomon, in all his glory, been handing down the Queen of Sheba at his
palace gate, he could not have done it more daintily, more tenderly,
more like a gentleman than James, the Howland carrier, when he
lifted down Ailie, his wife. The contrast of his small, swarthy,
weather-beaten, keen, worldly face to hers--pale, subdued, and
beautiful--was something wonderful. Rab looked on concerned and
puzzled, but ready for anything that might turn up, were it to
strangle the nurse, the porter, or even me. Ailie and he seemed great
friends.

‘Oh! I assure you, sir,’ returned John Chivery, ‘in my poor humble way,
sir, I’m too proud and honourable to do it, sir.’

Joe had small experience in love affairs, and had no notion how
different young ladies are at different times; he had expected to
take Dolly up again at the very point where he had left her after that
delicious evening ride, and was no more prepared for such an alteration
than to see the sun and moon change places. He had buoyed himself up all
day with an indistinct idea that she would certainly say ‘Don’t go,’ or
‘Don’t leave us,’ or ‘Why do you go?’ or ‘Why do you leave us?’ or would
give him some little encouragement of that sort; he had even entertained
the possibility of her bursting into tears, of her throwing herself into
his arms, of her falling down in a fainting fit without previous word
or sign; but any approach to such a line of conduct as this, had been so
far from his thoughts that he could only look at her in silent wonder.

‘I’ll beat this light about that hangdog face of yours (for hangdog it
is, if it answers to your voice), and rouse the neighbourhood besides,
if you detain me,’ said the blind man. ‘Let me go. Do you hear?’

The announcement, ‘Gentleman to speak with you, sir,’ induced Mr. Trott
to pause half-way in the glass of port, the contents of which he was in
the act of imbibing at the moment; to rise from his chair; and retreat
a few paces towards the window, as if to secure a retreat, in the event
of the visitor assuming the form and appearance of Horace Hunter. One
glance at Joseph Overton, however, quieted his apprehensions. He
courteously motioned the stranger to a seat. The waiter, after a little
jingling with the decanter and glasses, consented to leave the room;
and Joseph Overton, placing the broad-brimmed hat on the chair next
him, and bending his body gently forward, opened the business by saying
in a very low and cautious tone,

Always your faithful Friend.

"Righteous Heaven! I am dying!--You are killing me! Nephew, nephew, what
are you doing to my nose?"

[Illustration]

“Well, well!” rejoined the middy, with a laugh half-forced. “Take care
what you are about, or, by Jove, I’ll inform against you.”

MY DEAR KNIGHT,

‘Yes; don’t worrit your poor mother,’ said Mrs. Sanders.

"I'll go along with you, sir," he rejoined, "if you're agreeable,
to-morrow."

The surprise depicted on the countenances of his guests imparted new
courage to the host.

‘I’d never say another lesson to Miss Pinch if I was to be beat to death
for it!’ sobbed the pupil.

But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was
early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob
Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his
heart upon.

CHAPTER VI — OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM

Miss Mowcher winked assent. "Forced to send for me. Couldn't help it.
The climate affected _his_ dye; it did very well in Russia, but it was
no go here. You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as
he was. Like old iron!"

At last, an answer came from the two old ladies. They presented their
compliments to Mr. Copperfield, and informed him that they had given his
letter their best consideration, "with a view to the happiness of both
parties"--which I thought rather an alarming expression, not only
because of the use they had made of it in relation to the family
difference before-mentioned, but because I had (and have all my life)
observed that conventional phrases are a sort of fireworks, easily let
off, and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colors not at all
suggested by their original form. The Misses Spenlow added that they
begged to forbear expressing, "through the medium of correspondence," an
opinion on the subject of Mr. Copperfield's communication; but that if
Mr. Copperfield would do them the favor to call, upon a certain day,
(accompanied, if he thought proper, by a confidential friend), they
would be happy to hold some conversation on the subject.

When the day began to glimmer they stole out of the house, and, passing
into the street, stood still.

‘Wouldn’t you? Well! I’ll take that out. It’s perfectly true, though.’

It has been remarked that Mr Pecksniff was a moral man. So he was.
Perhaps there never was a more moral man than Mr Pecksniff, especially
in his conversation and correspondence. It was once said of him by a
homely admirer, that he had a Fortunatus’s purse of good sentiments in
his inside. In this particular he was like the girl in the fairy tale,
except that if they were not actual diamonds which fell from his lips,
they were the very brightest paste, and shone prodigiously. He was a
most exemplary man; fuller of virtuous precept than a copy book. Some
people likened him to a direction-post, which is always telling the
way to a place, and never goes there; but these were his enemies, the
shadows cast by his brightness; that was all. His very throat was moral.
You saw a good deal of it. You looked over a very low fence of white
cravat (whereof no man had ever beheld the tie for he fastened it
behind), and there it lay, a valley between two jutting heights of
collar, serene and whiskerless before you. It seemed to say, on the part
of Mr Pecksniff, ‘There is no deception, ladies and gentlemen, all is
peace, a holy calm pervades me.’ So did his hair, just grizzled with
an iron-grey which was all brushed off his forehead, and stood bolt
upright, or slightly drooped in kindred action with his heavy eyelids.
So did his person, which was sleek though free from corpulency. So did
his manner, which was soft and oily. In a word, even his plain black
suit, and state of widower and dangling double eye-glass, all tended to
the same purpose, and cried aloud, ‘Behold the moral Pecksniff!’

‘So be it!’ said the horseman, looking intently towards the fire, and
not at him who spoke.

‘Why, no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system,
since I see you cocked up behind your governor’s chair in the parlour, a
little vile ago,’ replied Sam.

‘To say!’ he cried. ‘Not I. I’m ready.--Yes,’ he added, as his eye fell
upon Barnaby, ‘I have a word to say, too. Come hither, lad.’

“Who would favour my poor girl—to call it favouring—if I didn’t?” said
the father.

The Last Will and Testament of William Blinder

‘It’s all over!’ thought Mr. Pickwick.

‘Fully determined,’ answered Riah, as he read his master’s face, and
learnt the book.

“You needn’t be frightened now,” said the old woman, still holding her
tight. “Come along with me.”

"I wish you'd go up stairs," said my aunt, as she threaded her needle,
"and give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and I'll be glad to know how he
gets on with his Memorial."

"It is that I happen to have become a partner in a House of business in
London, to which Mr. Obenreizer happens this very day to be expressly
recommended: and that, too, by another house of business in Switzerland,
in which (as it turns out) we both have a commercial interest.  He has
not told you?"

‘Hallo!’ he said, ‘Sairah! I needn’t ask you how you’ve been this long
time, for you’re in full bloom. All a-blowin and a-growin; ain’t she,
Polly?’

CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SURPRISES, LIKE
MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE.

“Very good indeed,” observed Miss Tox, approvingly.

‘I ne--ver saw such a baby,’ said Mr. Lumbey, the doctor.

‘Dead, sir.’

‘--Heerd a noise,’ continued Mr. Giles. ‘I says, at first, “This is
illusion”; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the
noise again, distinct.’

Believe me, my dear Cattermole,
                                                Always heartily yours.

‘If I wasn’t soured, my answer would be no. But being soured, Mr Wegg,
and driven to reckless madness and desperation, I suppose it’s Yes.’

As Mr. Pickwick said this, he got into the coach which had by this time
arrived: followed by the tipstaff. Sam having stationed himself on the
box, it rolled away.

‘Hush!’ said ‘Tilda. ‘Hem! Say, come in.’

When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and
were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was
considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it
over his shoulder. “Why, we are not going fishing!” said I. “No,”
returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”

The doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having
been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time, as if it were the
established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact
business at noon, and to make an appointment, by the twopenny post, a
day or two previous.

‘My opinion is, sir,’ returned Mark, ‘that what we’ve got to do is to
travel straight to the Dragon. There’s no need for you to go there,
where you’re known, unless you like. You may stop ten mile short of it.
I’ll go on. Mrs Lupin will tell me all the news. Mr Pinch will give me
every information that we want; and right glad Mr Pinch will be to do
it. My proposal is: To set off walking this afternoon. To stop when we
are tired. To get a lift when we can. To walk when we can’t. To do it at
once, and do it cheap.’

‘It don’t begin with a C at all,’ retorted Mrs Gamp, shaking her head.
‘It begins with a M.’

‘She’ll be here directly minit,’ returned Mrs Gamp. ‘Come with Sairey,
Mr Chuffey. Come with your own Sairey!’

It was near John’s time for coming home, but as Mrs John was desirous to
finish a special triumph of her skill before dinner, she did not go out
to meet him. Placidly, though rather consequentially smiling, she sat
stitching away with a regular sound, like a sort of dimpled little
charming Dresden-china clock by the very best maker.

“If you’ll be so good as just report Cap’en Cuttle here, when you get a
chance,” said the Captain, “I’ll wait.”

"Where's there?" inquired the carrier.

‘If I had held my tongue, you would never have seen the subject of my
question,’ remarked Lammle, darkening.

Accordingly, he thought the time was come for fitting out a great
expedition against the Norman-loving King. With it, he sailed to the
Isle of Wight, where he was joined by his son Harold, the most gallant
and brave of all his family. And so the father and son came sailing up
the Thames to Southwark; great numbers of the people declaring for
them, and shouting for the English Earl and the English Harold, against
the Norman favourites!

"HURLBUT'S STORY OF THE BIBLE" can be obtained in FLEXIBLE MOROCCO
BINDING with red under gold edges. This new binding will give the work
a wider use, for in this convenient form the objection to carrying the
ordinary bound book is entirely overcome. This convenient style also
contains "HURLBUT'S BIBLE LESSONS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS," a system of
questions and answers, based on the stories in the book, by which the
Old Testament story can be taught in a year, and the New Testament story
can be taught in a year. This edition also contains 17 Maps printed in
colors, covering the geography of the Old Testament and of the New
Testament.

Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain, and wrung its
shadowy hands.

It was no longer a place for him. In the course of the ensuing week the
following announcement was made in a well-known and widely-circulated
weekly paper. It was headed--

‘Who’s that?’ he inquired of Overton, in a whisper.

Macready, Nina, i. 195

‘Unless somebody pervades them with an apintment,’ said Mrs. Bloss,
joining in the conversation in a faint voice.

The ringing and knocking still continuing—his panic too—he went back to
the door in the bed-chamber, and with some new efforts, each more
stubborn than the last, wrenched it open. Seeing the little staircase
not far off, and feeling the night-air coming up, he stole back for his
hat and coat, made the door as secure after him as he could, crept down
lamp in hand, extinguished it on seeing the street, and having put it
in a corner, went out where the stars were shining.

‘I am poorly qualified to judge of such matters,’ replied Agnes, with
a modest hesitation, ‘but I certainly feel--in short, I feel that your
being secret and clandestine, is not being like yourself.’

Mr. Gamfield’s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he
returned to the table, and said,

‘And now they are partners,’ said I. ‘Confound him!’

‘Look here! Look here!’ said the hangman, stooping one knee beside the
body, and gazing up with a disconsolate face at the officer and men.
‘Here’s a pretty sight!’

"'And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the
thing pleased him.

Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble’s pursed-up
countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding
Oliver, in as few words as possible.

After pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some
time, Mr Swiveller drank some more of the beer, and summoning a small
boy who had been watching his proceedings, poured forth the few
remaining drops as a libation on the gravel, and bade him carry the
empty vessel to the bar with his compliments, and above all things to
lead a sober and temperate life, and abstain from all intoxicating and
exciting liquors.  Having given him this piece of moral advice for his
trouble (which, as he wisely observed, was far better than half-pence)
the Perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious Apollos thrust his hands
into his pockets and sauntered away: still pondering as he went.

"O' course it must," said Sam.

‘O yes!’ Here Mrs Lammle brought her handkerchief into play. ‘And you
know, dear Mr Fledgeby—you who study the human heart, and study the
world—what an affliction it would be to lose position and to lose
credit, when ability to tide over a very short time might save all
appearances.’

‘“I should wish, if you please,” said I, “to see the room.”

Peggotty cried out No! with an astonishing volume of voice; and then sat
down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn.

After pausing for some time, he slowly scrawls upon it in a hand that
is not his, “Chesney Wold?”

He didn’t even lift his hat to look up at the Bell tower when he came to
the old church on his return.  He halted there a moment, from habit: and
knew that it was growing dark, and that the steeple rose above him,
indistinct and faint, in the murky air.  He knew, too, that the Chimes
would ring immediately; and that they sounded to his fancy, at such a
time, like voices in the clouds.  But he only made the more haste to
deliver the Alderman’s letter, and get out of the way before they began;
for he dreaded to hear them tagging ‘Friends and Fathers, Friends and
Fathers,’ to the burden they had rung out last.

In the morning I was joined by Mr. Peggotty and by my old nurse, and we
went at an early hour to the coach office, where Mrs. Gummidge and Ham
were waiting to take leave of us.

Oliver had a very narrow escape a few days later, as the result of this
bill, from a villanous-looking man who wanted a chimney-sweep.  But
finally he became the apprentice of an undertaker named Sowerberry.  His
life here was some improvement over the workhouse, but still hard
enough.  Nevertheless he did get enough to eat, in the shape of broken
victuals, and he slept among the coffins in the shop.

“Bunsby!” urged the Captain, “it’s for liberty; will you three times?
Now or never!”

"Farther than that," said I. "I come from Bangor."

Suddenly he saw, a long way before him, a black clump and a couple of
lanterns. The clump was in motion, and the lanterns swung as though
carried by men walking. It was a patrol. And though it was merely
crossing his line of march, he judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot
as speedily as he could. He was not in the humor to be challenged, and
he was conscious of making a very conspicuous mark upon the snow. Just
on his left hand there stood a great hotel, with some turrets and a
large porch before the door; it was half-ruinous, he remembered, and
had long stood empty; and so he made three steps of it and jumped
inside the shelter of the porch. It was pretty dark inside, after
the glimmer of the snowy streets, and he was groping forward with
outspread hands, when he stumbled over some substance which offered an
indescribable mixture of resistances, hard and soft, firm and loose.
His heart gave a leap, and he sprang two steps back and stared
dreadfully at the obstacle. Then he gave a little laugh of relief. It
was only a woman, and she dead. He knelt beside her to make sure upon
this latter point. She was freezing cold, and rigid like a stick. A
little ragged finery fluttered in the wind about her hair, and her
cheeks had been heavily rouged that same afternoon. Her pockets were
quite empty; but in her stocking, underneath the garter, Villon found
two of the small coins that went by the name of whites. It was little
enough; but it was always something; and the poet was moved with a
deep sense of pathos that she should have died before she had spent
her money. That seemed to him a dark and pitiable mystery; and he
looked from the coins in his hand to the dead woman, and back again to
the coins, shaking his head over the riddle of man's life. Henry V. of
England, dying at Vincennes just after he had conquered France, and
this poor jade cut off by a cold draught in a great man's doorway,
before she had time to spend her couple of whites--it seemed a cruel
way to carry on the world. Two whites would have taken such a little
while to squander; and yet it would have been one more good taste in
the mouth, one more smack of the lips, before the devil got the soul,
and the body was left to birds and vermin. He would like to use all
his tallow before the light was blown out and the lantern broken.

The Captain’s voice was so tremendous, and he came out of his corner
with such way on him, that Rob retreated before him into another
corner: holding out the keys and packet, to prevent himself from being
run down.

‘Silence, sir!’ cried his father.

It was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary. They
persisted in withdrawing for the specified time. Accordingly, these
little birds hopped out with great dignity; leaving me to receive the
congratulations of Traddles, and to feel as if I were translated to
regions of exquisite happiness. Exactly at the expiration of the quarter
of an hour, they reappeared with no less dignity than they had
disappeared. They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were
made of autumn-leaves: and they came rustling back, in like manner.

“This person,” said Milly, in her clear, soft voice, which her mild eyes,
looking at him, made clearer and softer, “I found soon afterwards. I
went back to the house, and, with Heaven’s help, traced him. I was not
too soon. A very little and I should have been too late.”

‘I ought to ask you that. I am not the fortune-teller.’

"I have no hesitation in saying," said Mr. Chillip, fortifying himself
with another sip of negus, "between you and me, sir, that her mother
died of it--or that tyranny, gloom, and worry, have made Mrs. Murdstone
nearly imbecile. She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and
their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her, now,
more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law. That was Mrs.
Chillip's remark to me, only last week. And I assure you, sir, the
ladies are great observers. Mrs. Chillip herself is a _great_ observer!"

I thought I had killed her, this time. I sprinkled water on her face.
I went down on my knees. I plucked at my hair. I denounced myself as a
remorseless brute and a ruthless beast. I implored her forgiveness.
I besought her to look up. I ravaged Miss Mills’s work-box for a
smelling-bottle, and in my agony of mind applied an ivory needle-case
instead, and dropped all the needles over Dora. I shook my fists at Jip,
who was as frantic as myself. I did every wild extravagance that could
be done, and was a long way beyond the end of my wits when Miss Mills
came into the room.

‘I am very poor,’ I said, attempting to smile, ‘and have got no money.’

Here Mr. Pickwick, who had been writhing in silence for some time, gave
a violent start, as if some vague idea of assaulting Serjeant Buzfuz, in
the august presence of justice and law, suggested itself to his mind. An
admonitory gesture from Perker restrained him, and he listened to the
learned gentleman’s continuation with a look of indignation, which
contrasted forcibly with the admiring faces of Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs.
Sanders.

There never yet was a ghost story that did not prove a very simple
affair when the key to it was found. The captain of the Nænia never
would believe that anything uncommon was ever seen at all. He was,
however, as much in the wrong as those who believed that they had seen
a ghost. The occurrence could not be forgotten, though it ceased to be
talked of.

Johnson, Mrs S., 10.

As the lady spoke these words, Mr. Jackson turned from the coach where
he had been addressing some observations to a shabby man in black
leggings, who had just emerged from the vehicle with a thick ash-stick
in his hand, and made his way to the place where the ladies were
seated; winding his hair round the brim of his hat as he came along.

‘Is smartness American for forgery?’ asked Martin.

Charles Dickens remained in America through the winter, returning home
from New York in the _Russia_, on the 19th of April. His letters show
how entirely he gave himself up to the business of the readings, how
severely his health suffered from the climate, and from the perpetual
travelling and hard work, and yet how he was able to battle through to
the end. These letters are also full of allusions to the many kind and
dear friends who contributed so largely to the pleasure of this American
visit, and whose love and attention gave a touch of _home_ to his
private life, and left such affection and gratitude in his heart as he
could never forget. Many of these friends paid visits to Gad's Hill; the
first to come during this summer being Mr. Longfellow, his daughters,
and Mr. Appleton, brother-in-law of Mr. Longfellow, and Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Eliot Norton, of Cambridge.

Ireland, Mr. Alexander; see Letters

Her hands were clasped upon my shoulder, and her chin rested on them,
and her blue eyes looked quietly into mine.

dedicated to Charles Dickens.

Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain
the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be,
would redeem his pledge most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a
trembling hand, and opened the door.

“You surely don’t speak for yourself, Mr. Durdles,” returned Mr.
Datchery, “any more than for His Honour.”

She could mentally follow the great ships coming and going, and shake
hands with people at the ends of the earth. The very sight of a
fishing-boat, as painters seem to have found out, is a poem in itself.
But is it not all written in _Westward Ho!_ and in the _Prose Idylls_,
in which Kingsley put his most genuine power? Of all walks that I
have made, I can remember none more delightful than those round the
south-western promontory. I have followed the coast at different times
from the mouth of the Bristol Avon by the Land's End to the Isle of
Wight, and I am only puzzled to decide which bay or cape is the most
delightful. I only know that the most delightful was the more enjoyable
when placed in its proper setting by a long walk. When you have made
an early start, followed the coastguard track on the slopes above
the cliffs, struggled through the gold and purple carpeting of gorse
and heather on the moors, dipped down into quaint little coves with
a primitive fishing village, followed the blinding whiteness of the
sands round a lonely bay, and at last emerged upon a headland where
you can settle into a nook of the rocks, look down upon the glorious
blue of the Atlantic waves breaking into foam on the granite, and see
the distant sea-levels glimmering away till they blend imperceptibly
into cloudland; then you can consume your modest sandwiches, light
your pipe, and feel more virtuous and thoroughly at peace with the
universe than it is easy even to conceive yourself elsewhere. I have
fancied myself on such occasions to be a felicitous blend of poet and
saint--which is an agreeable sensation. What I wish to point out,
however, is that the sensation is confined to the walker. I respect the
cyclist, as I have said; but he is enslaved by his machine: he has to
follow the highroad, and can only come upon what points of view open
to the commonplace tourist. He can see nothing of the retired scenery
which may be close to him, and cannot have his mind brought into due
harmony by the solitude and by the long succession of lovely bits of
scenery which stand so coyly aside from public notice.

“Awast!” said the Captain. “My name’s Cuttle.”

‘Let me out,’ cried Mr. Pickwick. ‘Where’s my servant? Where are my
friends?’

Now, will you have it? I am inclined to believe that on the whole, it is
the best thing.

‘Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?’ inquired the gentleman in
the white waistcoat.

At first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel, and that we were verging
on the Desert of Sahara; but she soon found out how matters stood, for
my dear affectionate little Dora, embracing her, began exclaiming that I
was ‘a poor labourer’; and then cried for me, and embraced me, and asked
me would I let her give me all her money to keep, and then fell on Miss
Mills’s neck, sobbing as if her tender heart were broken.

No!  Far be such miscalled philosophy from us, dear Reader, on Christmas
Day!  Nearer and closer to our hearts be the Christmas spirit, which is
the spirit of active usefulness, perseverance, cheerful discharge of
duty, kindness and forbearance!  It is in the last virtues especially,
that we are, or should be, strengthened by the unaccomplished visions of
our youth; for, who shall say that they are not our teachers to deal
gently even with the impalpable nothings of the earth!

"Why, that I'd have the rascal punished,--that's what I said. Hanging's
too good for such a villain."

“Indeed, sir?”

“You seem very tired, my good woman.”

And he said all this--I knew, as I saw his face in the moonlight--that
I might understand he was resolved to recompense himself by using his
power. I had never doubted his meanness, his craft and malice; but I
fully comprehended now, for the first time, what a base, unrelenting,
and revengeful spirit, must have been engendered by this early, and this
long, suppression.

Sir Simon Degge, the last of a long line of paupers, was become the
possessor of the noble estate of Sir Roger Rockville of Rockville, the
last of a long line of aristocrats!

XXVI     IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY
         THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED

"It's my father, my dear," said Mr. Weller, turning with an explanatory
air to the young lady in the bar; "blessed if I think he hardly knows
wot my other name is. Vell, young brockiley sprout, wot then?"

‘And careful, I have no doubt,’ returned Mr Pecksniff.

A smiling look she had, a figure slight,
With cheerful air, and step both quick and light;
A strange and foreign look the maiden bore,
That suited the quaint Belgian dress she wore
Yet the blue fearless eyes in her fair face,
And her soft voice told her of English race;
And ever, as she flitted to and fro,
She sang, (or murmured, rather,) soft and low,
Snatches of song, as if she did not know
That she was singing, but the happy load
Of dream and thought thus from her heart o'erflowed:
And while on household cares she passed along,
The air would bear me fragments of her song;
Not such as village maidens sing, and few
The framers of her changing music knew;
Chants such as heaven and earth first heard of when
The master Palestrina held the pen.
But I with awe had often turned the page,
Yellow with time, and half defaced by age,
And listened, with an ear not quite unskilled,
While heart and soul to the grand echo thrilled;
And much I marvelled, as her cadence fell
From the Laudate, that I knew so well,
Into Scarlatti's minor fugue, how she
Had learned such deep and solemn harmony.
But what she told I set in rhyme, as meet
To chronicle the influence, dim and sweet,
'Neath which her young and innocent life had grown:
Would that my words were simple as her own.

I couldn't think of doing the honors of the feast at my time of life,
while he was by; my hand shook at the very thought of it. I begged him
to do me the favor of taking charge of the treat; and my request being
seconded by the other boys who were in that room, he agreed to it, and
sat upon my pillow, handing round the food--with perfect fairness, I
must say--and giving out the currant wine in a little glass without a
foot, which was his own property. As to me, I sat on his left hand, and
the rest were grouped about us, on the nearest beds and on the floor.

‘How do you do, ma’am!’ said Spottletoe to the strong-minded woman in a
tone of defiance. ‘I believe you see Mrs Spottletoe, ma’am?’

With these opinions it may be easily imagined that our curiosity and
interest were very much excited the other day, when a lady of our
acquaintance called on us and resolutely declined to accept our refusal
of her invitation to an evening party; ‘for,’ said she, ‘I have got a
lion coming.’ We at once retracted our plea of a prior engagement, and
became as anxious to go, as we had previously been to stay away.

The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”

‘Ah! There’s no love lost between us, I assure you,’ said Miss Price,
tying her bonnet strings with a jerk. ‘You’ll cry your eyes out, when
I’m gone; you know you will.’

Thereupon Jenny, placing the towel on a linen-horse, took the handle of
the pump with both hands and pumped over my head as handmaid had never
pumped before; so that the water poured in torrents from my head, my
face, and my hair down upon the brick floor.

‘And you come, brother,’ said Mr Wegg, in a hospitable glow, ‘you come
like I don’t know what—exactly like it—I shouldn’t know you from
it—shedding a halo all around you.’

‘Do you think so?’ replied Mr. Pickwick. ‘Well; if you are curious to
know, of course I have no objection.’

_President_—Professor Snore.  _Vice-Presidents_—Professors Doze and
                                 Wheezy.

You know very well that in those times there flourished divers evil old
women who, under the name of Witches, spread great disorder through the
land, and inflicted various dismal tortures upon Christian men; sticking
pins and needles into them when they least expected it, and causing them
to walk in the air with their feet upwards, to the great terror of their
wives and families, who were naturally very much disconcerted when the
master of the house unexpectedly came home, knocking at the door with his
heels and combing his hair on the scraper.  These were their commonest
pranks, but they every day played a hundred others, of which none were
less objectionable, and many were much more so, being improper besides;
the result was that vengeance was denounced against all old women, with
whom even the king himself had no sympathy (as he certainly ought to have
had), for with his own most Gracious hand he penned a most Gracious
consignment of them to everlasting wrath, and devised most Gracious means
for their confusion and slaughter, in virtue whereof scarcely a day
passed but one witch at the least was most graciously hanged, drowned, or
roasted in some part of his dominions.  Still the press teemed with
strange and terrible news from the North or the South, or the East or the
West, relative to witches and their unhappy victims in some corner of the
country, and the Public’s hair stood on end to that degree that it lifted
its hat off its head, and made its face pale with terror.

Come night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too
long by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the
windows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at
least with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so
sullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its
witch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to
every passerby, “Look here!”

‘Good gracious, I didn’t mean that, ma’am,’ said my aunt. ‘I mean, are
all these yours?’

‘Wery glad to see you, Sammy,’ said the elder Mr. Weller, ‘though how
you’ve managed to get over your mother-in-law, is a mystery to me. I
only vish you’d write me out the receipt, that’s all.’

‘He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?  You
would be his first resource, I think.’

‘He will be here directly, if you want him.’

“Impossible!”

“It’s impossible that I can on this subject, my dear girl. On any
other, readily.”

‘It was you, if I don’t deceive myself,’ she said, in a broken voice,
‘that came into the kitchen, the night she took such pity on me; was so
gentle to me; didn’t shrink away from me like all the rest, and gave me
such kind help! Was it you, sir?’

The resolution was, of course, carried with loud acclamations, every
man holding up both hands in favour of it, as he would in his enthusiasm
have held up both legs also, if he could have conveniently accomplished
it. This done, the draft of the proposed petition was read at length:
and the petition said, as all petitions DO say, that the petitioners
were very humble, and the petitioned very honourable, and the object
very virtuous; therefore (said the petition) the bill ought to be passed
into a law at once, to the everlasting honour and glory of that most
honourable and glorious Commons of England in Parliament assembled.

‘“You,” said the old gentleman.

‘John dear, you never can be jealous of Mr Lightwood?’

The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest
imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to
speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver
for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same
time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could
not forget it for months afterwards. He continued to utter the most
fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and
when they were once more on their way, they could see him some
distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his
hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.

I was still less able to speak than before.

‘Delightful!’ exclaimed Mrs. Tulrumble.

Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the
lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over
his head under his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken
eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days’ growth, wasted flesh, short
thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.

‘Oh, you wicked old rascal,’ cried one voice, ‘looking arter the girls,
are you?’

‘This is a very comfortable room, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bumble looking
round. ‘Another room, and this, ma’am, would be a complete thing.’

She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had
need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the
hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two
young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little
cheek, against his face, as if they said, "Don't mind it father. Don't
be grieved!"

I have hope of Mr. Morley,[58] whom one cannot see without knowing to be
a straightforward, earnest man. _I_ also think Higgins[59] will
materially help them.[60] Generally, I quite agree with you that they
hardly know what to be at; but it is an immensely difficult subject to
start, and they must have every allowance. At any rate, it is not by
leaving them alone and giving them no help, that they can be urged on to
success. (Travers, too, I think, a man of the Anti-Corn-Law-League
order.)

‘Oh yes; you, miss,’ interposed Phib.

STORY OF LITTLE DOMBEY. 1s.

* * * * *

"I!" cried the Spirit.

I asked Mr. Spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional
business? He replied, that a good case of a disputed will, where there
was a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds, was,
perhaps, the best of all. In such a case, he said, not only were there
very pretty pickings in the way of arguments at every stage of the
proceedings, and mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory
and counter-interrogatory (to say nothing of an appeal lying, first to
the Delegates, and then to the Lords); but, the costs being pretty sure
to come out of the estate at last, both sides went at it in a lively and
spirited manner, and expense was no consideration. Then, he launched
into a general eulogium on the Commons. What was to be particularly
admired (he said) in the Commons, was its compactness. It was the most
conveniently organised place in the world. It was the complete idea of
snugness. It lay in a nut-shell. For example: You brought a divorce
case, or a restitution case, into the Consistory. Very good. You tried
it in the Consistory. You made a quiet little round game of it, among a
family group, and you played it out at leisure. Suppose you were not
satisfied with the Consistory, what did you do then? Why, you went into
the Arches. What was the Arches? The same court, in the same room, with
the same bar, and the same practitioners, but another judge, for there
the Consistory judge could plead any court-day as an advocate. Well, you
played your round game out again. Still you were not satisfied. Very
good. What did you do then? Why, you went to the Delegates. Who were the
Delegates? Why, the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without
any business, who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in
both courts, and had seen the cards shuffled, and cut, and played, and
had talked to all the players about it, and now came fresh, as judges,
to settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody! Discontented
people might talk of corruption in the Commons, closeness in the
Commons, and the necessity of reforming the Commons, said Mr. Spenlow
solemnly, in conclusion; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been
highest, the Commons had been busiest; and a man might lay his hand upon
his heart, and say this to the whole world,--"Touch the Commons, and
down comes the country!"

"Yes, sir, we do know it," replied Dodson.

_Tuesday Morning._--The play went, as well as I can make out--I hoped to
have had Stanny's report of it, but he is ill--with great effect. There
was immense enthusiasm at its close, and great uproar and shouting for
me. Forster will go on Wednesday, and write you his account of it. I saw
the Keeleys on the stage at eleven o'clock or so, and they were in
prodigious spirits and delight.

“Lady Dedlock, you see she’s universally admired. That’s what her
ladyship is; she’s universally admired,” says Mr. Bucket.

"A new pal," replied Jack, pulling Oliver forward.

‘Faugh!’ said Peg, grubbing, in the discharge of her domestic functions,
among a scanty heap of ashes in the rusty grate. ‘Wedding indeed! A
precious wedding! He wants somebody better than his old Peg to take care
of him, does he? And what has he said to me, many and many a time, to
keep me content with short food, small wages, and little fire? “My will,
Peg! my will!” says he: “I’m a bachelor--no friends--no relations, Peg.”
 Lies! And now he’s to bring home a new mistress, a baby-faced chit of a
girl! If he wanted a wife, the fool, why couldn’t he have one suitable
to his age, and that knew his ways? She won’t come in MY way, he says.
No, that she won’t, but you little think why, Arthur boy!’

"Sam!"

Doors had lost their hinges, and were holding on by their latches;
windows were broken, painted plaster had peeled off, and was lying about
in clods; fowls and cats had so taken possession of the out-buildings,
that I couldn’t help thinking of the fairy tales, and eyeing them with
suspicion, as transformed retainers, waiting to be changed back again.
One old Tom in particular: a scraggy brute, with a hungry green eye (a
poor relation, in reality, I am inclined to think): came prowling round
and round me, as if he half believed, for the moment, that I might be the
hero come to marry the lady, and set all to-rights; but discovering his
mistake, he suddenly gave a grim snarl, and walked away with such a
tremendous tail, that he couldn’t get into the little hole where he
lived, but was obliged to wait outside, until his indignation and his
tail had gone down together.

I forgot him!!

It demanded cogitation. ‘You see, my dear,’ he explained, ‘you really
have become such a very lovely woman, that it ought to be a very quiet
place.’ At length he suggested, ‘Near the garden up by the Trinity House
on Tower Hill.’ So, they were driven there, and Bella dismissed the
chariot; sending a pencilled note by it to Mrs Boffin, that she was with
her father.

[Illustration: Original manuscript of Page 61.]

The rulers of the nation,
The poor ones at their gate,
With the same eager wonder
The same great news await.
The poor man's stay and comfort,
The rich man's joy and pride,
Upon the bleak Crimean shore
Are fighting side by side.

“Perhaps he is rather thinking of saving his father,” observed the
surveyor.

The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding. Incessant machinations
were to be kept at work by Mr and Mrs Lammle; love was to be made for
Fledgeby, and conquest was to be insured to him; he on his part
very humbly admitting his defects as to the softer social arts, and
entreating to be backed to the utmost by his two able coadjutors.

‘Mr. Bumble!’ cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright
was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, ‘Mr. Bumble, I
shall scream!’ Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified
manner, put his arm round the matron’s waist.

Not a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in
silence. If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly
averted. When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.
They seemed never to have heard its tones before.

‘Send her here,’ said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. ‘Send
her here.’

It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the
tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors
of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it
was Mr. Giles’s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler
servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with
a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to
remind them of his superior position in society. But, death, fires,
and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs
stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the
table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and
minute account of the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially
the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with
breathless interest.

‘I don’t want to deceive you. Father’s on the river in his boat.’

I fear we must look elsewhere for the origin of those beautiful lines;
and I think I can put the public on the right scent. In 1749, Colonel de
Beaumanoir, a native of Britanny, having rained a regiment in his own
neighbourhood, went out with it to India, in that unfortunate expedition
commanded by Lally-Tolendal, the failure of which eventual lost to
the French their possessions in Hindostan. The colonel was killed in
defending, against the forces of Coote, PONDICHERRY, the last stronghold
of the French in that hemisphere. He was buried that night on the north
bastion of the fortress by a few faithful followers, and the next day
the fleet sailed with the remainder of the garrison for Europe. In the
appendix to the "Memoirs of LALLY-TOLENDAL," by his Son, the following
lines occur, which bear some resemblance to those attributed to Wolfe.
Perhaps Wolf Tone may have communicated them to his relative the
clergyman on his return from France. _Fides sit penès lectorem._

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other
people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now
stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and
papers in their hands, and bowed to him.

“‘What do you think of this, Gabriel?’ said the goblin, kicking up his
feet in the air on either side the tombstone, and looking at the
turned-up points with as much complacency as if he had been
contemplating the most fashionable pair of Wellingtons in all Bond
Street.

His prospects were widely different from those with which he had left
it. To play the game I have described at _rouge et noir_, requires
a capital. Every respectable house was closed against him. He now
disguised his appearance, so that his former acquaintance should not be
able to recognise him, and frequented the lowest hells--those _cloacæ_,
the resort of all the _vilains_ and _chenapans_, the lowest dregs of
the metropolis. By what practices this _mauvais sujet_ contrived to
support life here for some years is best known to the police, where his
name stands chronicled pretty legibly; it is probable that he passed
much of that time in one of the prisons, or on the roads.

“The thing is prodigious!”

"'It was _not_ the echoes,' said the goblin.

"You're a young traveller, my child," he said, laying his hand gently on
her head. "Your grandchild, friend?"

‘Oh!  He wouldn’t, wouldn’t he?’ said Dick.

‘And what made you ask it of me? Suppose I should tell you wrong?’

‘I should like to see you do it, Sir,’ said Mr. Noddy.

‘Any other letters?’

‘It is,’ replied Alexander, delivering in the following:—‘Mrs. Briggs
and three daughters, Mr. Samuel Briggs.’ The previous ceremony was
repeated, and Mrs. Briggs and three daughters were declared to be
black-balled. Mr. Alexander Briggs looked rather foolish, and the
remainder of the company appeared somewhat overawed by the mysterious
nature of the proceedings.

Mr. Weller’s easy manners and conversational powers had such
irresistible influence with his new friends, that before the dinner was
half over, they were on a footing of perfect intimacy, and in possession
of a full account of the delinquency of Job Trotter.

‘We must make up for lost time when we’ve got things into a good
train. That’s all I know,’ said Sikes.

"For lone people as have got nobody to care for them, or take care
of them, or as have been hurt in their mind, or that kind of thing,"
observed Mr. Raddle, plucking up a little cheerfulness, and looking
round, "the country is all very well. The country for a wounded spirit,
they say."

‘Oh no! I dare say,’ rejoined Miss Snevellicci. And Miss Ledrook said,
‘Upon my word!’ Upon which Miss Snevellicci said that Miss Ledrook was a
giddy thing; and Miss Ledrook said that Miss Snevellicci needn’t colour
up quite so much; and Miss Snevellicci beat Miss Ledrook, and Miss
Ledrook beat Miss Snevellicci.

[Sidenote: Mr. Charles Knight.]

‘D’ye hear, Work’us?’ said Noah Claypole.

Captain Arthur Gore, who afterwards became Lieutenant-General Gore,
alludes to him in the following terms: "This incomparable officer was
deservedly esteemed by the Duke of Wellington, who honoured him with
his particular confidence and regard."[2]

‘She was so used to do it, Clennam, that even then, such a picture of
passion as you never saw, she stopped short, looked me full in the face,
and counted (as I made out) to eight. But she couldn’t control herself
to go any further. There she broke down, poor thing, and gave the other
seventeen to the four winds. Then it all burst out. She detested us, she
was miserable with us, she couldn’t bear it, she wouldn’t bear it, she
was determined to go away. She was younger than her young mistress, and
would she remain to see her always held up as the only creature who was
young and interesting, and to be cherished and loved? No. She wouldn’t,
she wouldn’t, she wouldn’t! What did we think she, Tattycoram, might
have been if she had been caressed and cared for in her childhood, like
her young mistress? As good as her? Ah! Perhaps fifty times as good.
When we pretended to be so fond of one another, we exulted over her;
that was what we did; we exulted over her and shamed her. And all in
the house did the same. They talked about their fathers and mothers, and
brothers and sisters; they liked to drag them up before her face. There
was Mrs Tickit, only yesterday, when her little grandchild was with her,
had been amused by the child’s trying to call her (Tattycoram) by the
wretched name we gave her; and had laughed at the name. Why, who didn’t;
and who were we that we should have a right to name her like a dog or a
cat? But she didn’t care. She would take no more benefits from us; she
would fling us her name back again, and she would go. She would leave
us that minute, nobody should stop her, and we should never hear of her
again.’

I saw it was a weight off Charley’s mind, but it was a greater weight
off mine. I knew the worst now and was composed to it. I shall not
conceal, as I go on, the weaknesses I could not quite conquer, but
they always passed from me soon and the happier frame of mind stayed
by me faithfully.

Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to
Stephen Blackpool, but he cut the quotation short with an angry start.

Father's, My, Old Hall, 453.

‘I see it, of course,’ replied Rose, smiling at the doctor’s
impetuosity; ‘but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate
the poor child.’

‘And why not?’ retorted Sir Mulberry. ‘My dear creature, now why do you
keep up this show of displeasure?’

(‘Humph!’ thought I, as I looked at him.  ‘But I WON’T go up the track,
and I WILL go on the grass.’)

Miss Tox left her seat in a hurry, and returned to her plants; clipping
among the stems and leaves, with as little favour as a barber working
at so many pauper heads of hair.

"A wreck! Close by!"

“I beg your worship’s pardon,” said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of his
having heard aright,—“did your worship speak to me?”

“Not the least in the world.”

‘By the bye,’ said Mr. Tuckle, ‘Smauker, my boy, you--’ The remainder of
the sentence was forwarded into Mr. John Smauker’s ear, by whisper.

‘At any rate, you have some subject of interest there which used not to
be there?’

The next night I left Salem House, after a tender adieu to Steerforth,
Traddles, and all the rest.  I little thought that I left the school
never to return.

Wavre, 112.

When the man had shut the green gate after him, he walked, as we have
said twice already, with a brisk pace up the courtyard; but he no sooner
caught sight of Mr. Weller than he faltered, and stopped, as if
uncertain, for the moment, what course to adopt. As the green gate was
closed behind him, and there was no other outlet but the one in front,
however, he was not long in perceiving that he must pass Mr. Samuel
Weller to get away. He therefore resumed his brisk pace, and advanced,
staring straight before him. The most extraordinary thing about the man
was, that he was contorting his face into the most fearful and
astonishing grimaces that ever were beheld. Nature’s handiwork never was
disguised with such extraordinary artificial carving, as the man had
overlaid his countenance with in one moment.

“Twice.”

We were well upon the summit of the mountain: and had before us the rude
cross of wood, denoting its greatest altitude above the sea: when the
light of the rising sun, struck, all at once, upon the waste of snow, and
turned it a deep red.  The lonely grandeur of the scene was then at its
height.

‘I thought you were his father!’

MR. CHARLES DICKENS, in receiving the presentation, said, he accepted
with heartfelt delight and cordial gratitude such beautiful specimens of
Sheffield-workmanship; and he begged to assure them that the kind
observations which had been made by the Mayor, and the way in which they
had been responded to by that assembly, would never be obliterated from
his remembrance.  The present testified not only to the work of Sheffield
hands, but to the warmth and generosity of Sheffield hearts.  It was his
earnest desire to do right by his readers, and to leave imaginative and
popular literature associated with the private homes and public rights of
the people of England.  The case of cutlery with which he had been so
kindly presented, should be retained as an heirloom in his family; and he
assured them that he should ever be faithful to his death to the
principles which had earned for him their approval.  In taking his
reluctant leave of them, he wished them many merry Christmases, and many
happy new years.

Ducks on a pond, when gobblin' up duck-meat,
    Ne'er smack'd a music half so sadly sweet!
    Miss Biddy Reilly's long-lash'd eyes of jet
    Were red (as rivalling her hair) and wet!
    Some inward feeling caus'd this outward woe;
    But what it was but love for Darby, I don't know!

‘He did arrive before you, my dear sir,’ retorted Pecksniff, raising his
voice for the edification of Tom upon the stairs, ‘and was about, I dare
say, to tell me of your coming, when I begged him first to knock at my
daughters’ chamber, and inquire after Charity, my dear child, who is not
so well as I could wish. No,’ said Mr Pecksniff, answering their looks,
‘I am sorry to say, she is not. It is merely an hysterical affection;
nothing more, I am not uneasy. Mr Pinch! Thomas!’ exclaimed Pecksniff,
in his kindest accents. ‘Pray come in. I shall make no stranger of you.
Thomas is a friend of mine, of rather long-standing, Mr Chuzzlewit, you
must know.’

His travelling baggage is easily carried in his hand, and he repairs
with it on foot, to a hybrid hotel in a little square behind Aldersgate
Street, near the General Post Office. It is hotel, boarding-house, or
lodging-house, at its visitor’s option. It announces itself, in the new
Railway Advertisers, as a novel enterprise, timidly beginning to spring
up. It bashfully, almost apologetically, gives the traveller to
understand that it does not expect him, on the good old constitutional
hotel plan, to order a pint of sweet blacking for his drinking, and
throw it away; but insinuates that he may have his boots blacked
instead of his stomach, and maybe also have bed, breakfast, attendance,
and a porter up all night, for a certain fixed charge. From these and
similar premises, many true Britons in the lowest spirits deduce that
the times are levelling times, except in the article of high roads, of
which there will shortly be not one in England.

BY CHARLES DICKENS.

"My lads, I hear there are discontented ones among ye. Let any such
stand forth."

He dismounted from the chaise, and telling the driver—even that was not
easy in his agitation—to remain behind for a few minutes, and then to
follow slowly, ran on with exceeding swiftness, tried the gate, scaled
the wall, jumped down on the other side, and stood panting in the old
orchard.

At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and
uttering it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl,
hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with
blood. He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a
sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help,
and groaned with pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and
exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from
head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.

Three or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the
different articles in requisition, while a couple of large-headed,
circular-visaged males rose from their seats in the chimney-corner
(for although it was a May evening, their attachment to the wood
fire appeared as cordial as if it were Christmas), and dived into
some obscure recesses, from which they speedily produced a bottle of
blacking, and some half-dozen brushes.

‘The what?’ exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.

“Very much so indeed, ma’am,” said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a
chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to
distress her.

As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself
than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time
afterwards: Oliver sat quite still.

‘How pale you are to-night!’ said Barnaby, leaning on his stick. ‘We
have been cruel, Grip, and made her anxious!’

"Friends!" interposed the man, in a voice which rattled in his throat.
"If I lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the world; tight
screwed down and soldered in my coffin; rotting in the dark and filthy
ditch that drags its slime along, beneath the foundations of this
prison; I could not be more forgotten or unheeded than I am here. I
am a dead man; dead to society, without the pity they bestow on those
whose souls have passed to judgment. Friends to see _me_! My God! I
have sunk, from the prime of life into old age, in this place, and
there is not one to raise his hand above my bed when I lie dead upon
it, and say, 'It is a blessing he is gone!'"

“The younger brother impatiently rejoined, ‘With twelve o’clock?’

Not another word did Mr. Dick utter on the subject; but he made a very
telegraph of himself for the next half-hour (to the great disturbance of
my aunt's mind), to enjoin inviolable secresy on me.

"What is become of the magic fish-bone?"

"Pell?" said Sam.

Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so
she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his
arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off
into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the
copper.

"Yes, surely," replied Nell.  "I have been looking at them nearly all
the time you have been away."

He reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates
stirring at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the
garden. A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped,
he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his
former companions. Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went;
for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and
playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together,
many and many a time.

‘Uncommon juicy steak that,’ said Squeers, as he laid down his knife and
fork, after plying it, in silence, for some time.

"Oh, thank you, Mr. Copperfield! What dear flowers!" said Dora.

Somehow, as I wrote to Agnes on a fine evening by my open window, and
the remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came stealing
over me, it shed such a peaceful influence upon the hurry and agitation
in which I had been living lately, and of which my very happiness
partook in some degree, that it soothed me into tears. I remember that
I sat resting my head upon my hand, when the letter was half done,
cherishing a general fancy as if Agnes were one of the elements of my
natural home. As if, in the retirement of the house made almost sacred
to me by her presence, Dora and I must be happier than anywhere. As if,
in love, joy, sorrow, hope, or disappointment; in all emotions; my heart
turned naturally there, and found its refuge and best friend.

“Scores,” says Mr. Bagnet.

The doctor stood aside without another word, when he heard the dying man
speak thus, and the old servant drew near, and, stooping over softly,
held the looking-glass before his master.  Presently afterwards, we, who
stood around looking breathlessly at him, saw such a rapture upon his
face, as left no doubt upon our minds that the face which had haunted him
so long, had, in his last hour, disappeared.

THE END

“Are there many members of that Upper Assembly?”

But here Peggotty, who had been going about from one to another in a
hurried way, kissing everybody, called out from the cart, in which we
all were by this time (Em'ly and I on two little chairs, side by side),
that Mrs. Gummidge must do it. So Mrs. Gummidge did it; and, I am sorry
to relate, cast a damp upon the festive character of our departure, by
immediately bursting into tears, and sinking subdued into the arms of
Ham, with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden, and had
better be carried to the House at once. Which I really thought was a
sensible idea, that Ham might have acted on.

As she looked full at me, I saw her face grow sharper and paler, and the
marks of the old wound lengthen out until it cut through the disfigured
lip, and deep into the nether lip, and slanted down the face. There was
something positively awful to me in this, and in the brightness of her
eyes, as she said, looking fixedly at me:

"And how," said the captain, drawing his chair still closer to
Tregarthen, and clapping his hand upon his shoulder,--"how may you know
it?"

Bricklayers often tramp, in twos and threes, lying by night at their
‘lodges,’ which are scattered all over the country.  Bricklaying is
another of the occupations that can by no means be transacted in rural
parts, without the assistance of spectators—of as many as can be
convened.  In thinly-peopled spots, I have known brick-layers on tramp,
coming up with bricklayers at work, to be so sensible of the
indispensability of lookers-on, that they themselves have sat up in that
capacity, and have been unable to subside into the acceptance of a
proffered share in the job, for two or three days together.  Sometimes,
the ‘navvy,’ on tramp, with an extra pair of half-boots over his
shoulder, a bag, a bottle, and a can, will take a similar part in a job
of excavation, and will look at it without engaging in it, until all his
money is gone.  The current of my uncommercial pursuits caused me only
last summer to want a little body of workmen for a certain spell of work
in a pleasant part of the country; and I was at one time honoured with
the attendance of as many as seven-and-twenty, who were looking at six.

‘I quite regret you were not with us yesterday,’ said Mr Henry Gowan,
calling on Clennam the next morning. ‘We had an agreeable day up the
river there.’

“Wery pretty indeed it is,” remarked Duff, in an under tone.

The faggots burned, the porkling turned
      And crackled before the fire;
    And an odour arose, that was sweet in the nose
      Of a passing ghostly friar.

I am greatly pleased with your opening paper in the Illuminated. It is
very wise, and capital; written with the finest end of that iron pen of
yours; witty, much needed, and full of truth. I vow to God that I think
the parrots of society are more intolerable and mischievous than its
birds of prey. If ever I destroy myself, it will be in the bitterness of
hearing those infernal and damnably good old times extolled. Once, in a
fit of madness, after having been to a public dinner which took place
just as this Ministry came in, I wrote the parody I send you enclosed,
for Fonblanque. There is nothing in it but wrath; but that's wholesome,
so I send it you.

THAT these and other the horrors and dangers with which the said
Bissextile, or Leap Year, threatens the gentlemen of England on every
occasion of its periodical return, have been greatly aggravated and
augmented by the terms of Her Majesty’s said Most Gracious communication,
which have filled the heads of divers young ladies in this Realm with
certain new ideas destructive to the peace of mankind, that never entered
their imagination before.

“Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him!” observed Mrs.
Badger.

“_That_ was not my doing,” observed Monks.

‘Why, I can’t say they did,’ he returned. ‘When we had comparatively
reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You
recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter
with her spine?’

He appeared to be only too conscious of it himself. When he came in, he
stood still; and with his head bowed, as if he felt it. This was
only for a moment; for Agnes softly said to him, ‘Papa! Here is Miss
Trotwood--and Trotwood, whom you have not seen for a long while!’ and
then he approached, and constrainedly gave my aunt his hand, and shook
hands more cordially with me. In the moment’s pause I speak of, I saw
Uriah’s countenance form itself into a most ill-favoured smile. Agnes
saw it too, I think, for she shrank from him.

"Not much," said Mr. Micawber, slightingly. "Mr. Wickfield is, I dare
say, a man of very excellent intentions; but he is--in short, he is
obsolete."

Mr Lightwood murmured ‘Vigorous Saxon spirit—Mrs Boffin’s
ancestors—bowmen—Agincourt and Cressy.’

They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back
of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,
melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and
desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and
Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as
he had used to be.

She then asked his leave to prepare breakfast; and her grandfather
coming downstairs after a while, they all three sat down together.
While they were eating, their host said that the old man seemed much
tired, and stood in need of rest.

FYTTE I.

“Heaven knows,” said I.  “I cried something to that effect—”

‘My good fellow,’ said his smiling father, ‘you quite affect me. Go
on, my dear Edward, I beg. But remember your promise. There is great
earnestness, vast candour, a manifest sincerity in all you say, but I
fear I observe the faintest indications of a tendency to prose.’

‘I cannot, will not leave you thus,’ returned Nicholas. ‘I have a duty
to discharge; and, either here, or in the room from which we have just
now come, at whatever risk or hazard to Mr. Bray, I must beseech you to
contemplate again the fearful course to which you have been impelled.’

‘You, Mr. Bumble!’

Mr. Magsman repeated, deliberately and emphatically, Along of a Dwarf.

‘What do you mean by nobody?  Didn’t I hear a woman’s step go up-stairs
when my hand was on the latch?’

This conveyance, the box of which I was fortunate enough to secure, had
come down to meet us at the railroad station, and was as muddy and
cumbersome as usual.  As more passengers were waiting for us at the
inn-door, the coachman observed under his breath, in the usual
self-communicative voice, looking the while at his mouldy harness as if
it were to that he was addressing himself,

‘That ain’t foreign, bless you!’ cried Mark. ‘Native as oysters, that
is! One more, because it’s native! As a mark of respect for the land we
live in! This don’t count as between you and me, you understand,’ said
Mr Tapley. ‘I ain’t a-kissing you now, you’ll observe. I have been among
the patriots; I’m a-kissin’ my country.’

Grimaldi took off his hat, made another low bow, and wished Mr. Kemble
good morning; and so they parted.

OFFICE OF "ALL THE YEAR ROUND,"
                                              _Monday, 3rd May, 1869._

‘I can’t bear it,’ said Tom, shaking his head. ‘No. I really cannot. You
must excuse me, John. I have a great esteem and friendship for you;
I love you very much; and have been perfectly charmed and overjoyed
to-day, to find you just the same as ever; but I cannot listen to this.’

MY DEAR OUVRY,

‘You asked me if I accounted for the disappearance to myself,’ Mrs
Clennam sternly reminded him, ‘not if I accounted for it to you. I do
not pretend to account for it to you, sir. I understand it to be no more
my business to do that, than it is yours to require that.’

“I am sorry to say I am.”

GEORGE SILVERMAN'S EXPLANATION

‘No,’ cried Mrs. Kenwigs, ‘I scorn it.’

Gashford, with a smiling face, but still with looks of profound
deference and humility, betook himself towards his master’s room,
smoothing his hair down as he went, and humming a psalm tune. As he
approached Lord George’s door, he cleared his throat and hummed more
vigorously.

"But, Caroline,--the breeches are really gone!"

At first sight of this phenomenon (for Dolly was by no means accustomed
to displays of this sort, rather learning from her mother’s example to
avoid them as much as possible) Mrs Varden expressed her belief that
never was any woman so beset as she; that her life was a continued scene
of trial; that whenever she was disposed to be well and cheerful, so
sure were the people around her to throw, by some means or other, a damp
upon her spirits; and that, as she had enjoyed herself that day, and
Heaven knew it was very seldom she did enjoy herself so she was now to
pay the penalty. To all such propositions Miggs assented freely. Poor
Dolly, however, grew none the better for these restoratives, but rather
worse, indeed; and seeing that she was really ill, both Mrs Varden and
Miggs were moved to compassion, and tended her in earnest.

The old man looked round the table, and leered more horribly than ever,
as if in triumph, at the attention which was depicted in every face.
Then rubbing his chin with his hand, and looking up to the ceiling as
if to recall the circumstances to his memory, he began as follows:

‘What have all these men to do with that?’ she said.

This was equal to John’s most sanguine expectations; but he would have
preferred Mr Haredale’s looking at him when he spoke, as if he really
did thank him, to his walking up and down, speaking by fits and starts,
often stopping with his eyes fixed on the ground, moving hurriedly on
again, like one distracted, and seeming almost unconscious of what he
said or did.

‘Not an hour--not a minute,’ replied Nicholas, impatiently.

‘How’s the pie?’ he said, rousing himself.

“No, miss, nor I can’t help it,” says Charley. “And if you please,
miss, Mr. Jarndyce’s love, and he thinks you’ll like to teach me now
and then. And if you please, Tom and Emma and me is to see each other
once a month. And I’m so happy and so thankful, miss,” cried Charley
with a heaving heart, “and I’ll try to be such a good maid!”

"Very good plant, Mr. Pickwick," replied Jackson, slowly shaking his
head. "But it won't do. No harm in trying, but there's little to be got
out of me."

‘Poor creature!’ said Kate.

Mr Pecksniff looked about him for a moment, and then knocked at the
door of a very dingy edifice, even among the choice collection of dingy
edifices at hand; on the front of which was a little oval board like
a tea-tray, with this inscription--‘Commercial Boarding-House: M.
Todgers.’

MY DEAREST KATE,

‘I beg your pardon,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

‘No,’ replied the woman; ‘if he--she pointed to Monks--‘has been
coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all
these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more
to say. I _did_ sell them, and they’re where you’ll never get them.
What then?’

“Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook. “Well put! Prettily pointed!
Good indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.”

Not but what he could make a stand when he was so minded, for, coming to
the end of the roofed shelter (it is of considerable extent at Mugby
Junction) and looking out upon the dark night, with a yet darker
spirit-wing of storm beating its wild way through it, he faced about, and
held his own as ruggedly in the difficult direction, as he had held it in
the easier one.  Thus, with a steady step, the traveller went up and
down, up and down, up and down, seeking nothing, and finding it.

This question disposed of, Kate communicated her uncle’s desire about
the empty house, to which Mrs. Nickleby assented with equal readiness,
characteristically remarking, that, on the fine evenings, it would be a
pleasant amusement for her to walk to the West end to fetch her daughter
home; and no less characteristically forgetting, that there were such
things as wet nights and bad weather to be encountered in almost every
week of the year.

At this point she was fain to stop for breath; and advantage may be
taken of the circumstance, to state that a fearful mystery surrounded
this lady of the name of Harris, whom no one in the circle of Mrs Gamp’s
acquaintance had ever seen; neither did any human being know her place
of residence, though Mrs Gamp appeared on her own showing to be in
constant communication with her. There were conflicting rumours on the
subject; but the prevalent opinion was that she was a phantom of Mrs
Gamp’s brain--as Messrs. Doe and Roe are fictions of the law--created
for the express purpose of holding visionary dialogues with her on all
manner of subjects, and invariably winding up with a compliment to the
excellence of her nature.

“And observe,” said the Manager, taking him up quickly, “it will be of
still less use, Gay, if you persist in forcing Mr John Carker’s name on
people’s attention. That is not the way to befriend Mr John Carker. Ask
him if he thinks it is.”

Firm of look and firm of purpose, she intently watched its coming on,
until it was very near; then, with a touch unshipped her sculls, and
crept aft in the boat, between kneeling and crouching. Once, she let the
body evade her, not being sure of her grasp. Twice, and she had seized
it by its bloody hair.

‘Certainly: good morning.’

‘Ye--es, ye--es; like a friend,’ replied the other.

“See to it, Gabelle. Go on!”

‘What now?’ cried the Jew impatiently.

“Thank your ladyship. I ought first to explain to your ladyship,” Mr.
Guppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at
his feet, “that Miss Summerson, whose image, as I formerly mentioned
to your ladyship, was at one period of my life imprinted on my ’eart
until erased by circumstances over which I had no control,
communicated to me, after I had the pleasure of waiting on your
ladyship last, that she particularly wished me to take no steps
whatever in any manner at all relating to her. And Miss Summerson’s
wishes being to me a law (except as connected with circumstances over
which I have no control), I consequently never expected to have the
distinguished honour of waiting on your ladyship again.”

‘And therefore—and therefore,’ the cherub went on in a glowing voice,
as Bella’s hand stole gradually up his waistcoat to his neck, ‘this
mercenary young person distantly related to myself, refused the
price, took off the splendid fashions that were part of it, put on the
comparatively poor dress that I had last given her, and trusting to my
supporting her in what was right, came straight to me. Have I led up to
it?’

I do not know what your literary vows of temperance or abstinence may
be, but as I do honestly know that there is no living English writer
whose aid I would desire to enlist in preference to the authoress of
"Mary Barton" (a book that most profoundly affected and impressed me), I
venture to ask you whether you can give me any hope that you will write
a short tale, or any number of tales, for the projected pages.

‘I have no complaint to make, sir.’  With a half shake of his head, a
half shrug of his shoulders, and a kind of apologetic smile.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES

Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the
air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand
mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.

He answered in the affirmative. Mr Chollop winked at the other citizen.

"Awful!" I exclaimed, in surprise; "that is hardly the expression I
should have used in connection with those words."

* * * * *

“I am glad to hear you admit so much, sir,” retorted Mr. Honeythunder,
in his most offensive manner; “and I candidly tell you that I didn’t
expect it.” Here he lowered heavily at Mr. Crisparkle again.

‘Now tell me the truth. Do you know anything about that?’

I am beginning to think of the Birmingham readings. I suppose you won't
object to be taken to hear them? This is the last place at which we
shall make a stay of more than one day. We shall stay at Parma one, and
at Turin one, supposing De la Rue to have been successful in taking
places with the courier into France for the day on which we want them
(he was to write to bankers at Turin to do it), and then we shall come
hard and fast home. I feel almost there already, and shall be delighted
to close the pleasant trip, and get back to my own Piccola Camera--if,
being English, you understand what _that_ is. My best love and kisses to
Mamey, Katey, Sydney, Harry, and the noble Plorn. Last, not least, to
yourself, and many of them. I will not wait over to-morrow, tell Kate,
for her letter; but will write then, whether or no.

‘Here am I, sir.’

She was always with him. He knew her, generally; though, in the
wandering of his brain, he often confused the circumstances under which
he spoke to her. Thus he would address her, sometimes, as if his boy
were newly dead; and would tell her, that although he had said nothing
of her ministering at the little bedside, yet he had seen it—he had
seen it; and then would hide his face and sob, and put out his worn
hand. Sometimes he would ask her for herself. “Where is Florence?” “I
am here, Papa, I am here.” “I don’t know her!” he would cry. “We have
been parted so long, that I don’t know her!” and then a staring dread
would be upon him, until she could soothe his perturbation; and recall
the tears she tried so hard, at other times, to dry.

‘Now the cravat.’ And it was taken off.

[Sidenote: Mr. W. C. Macready.]

It was not without great reluctance and misgiving that Mr Swiveller,
next morning, his head racked by the fumes of the renowned Schiedam,
repaired to the lodging of his friend Trent (which was in the roof of
an old house in an old ghostly inn), and recounted by very slow degrees
what had yesterday taken place between him and Quilp.  Nor was it
without great surprise and much speculation on Quilp’s probable
motives, nor without many bitter comments on Dick Swiveller’s folly,
that his friend received the tale.

This unlucky page, engaged in an evil hour at six pounds ten per annum,
was a source of continual trouble to me. I watched him as he grew--and
he grew like scarlet beans--with painful apprehensions of the time when
he would begin to shave; even of the days when he would be bald or grey.
I saw no prospect of ever getting rid of him; and, projecting myself
into the future, used to think what an inconvenience he would be when he
was an old man.

‘This is the woman, is it?’ demanded Monks.

Harriet bending over her, composed and soothed her. By and bye, Alice
lying as before, with the hand against her face, asked to have her
mother called.

Oh she looked very pretty, she looked very, very pretty! If the father
of the late John Harmon had but left his money unconditionally to his
son, and if his son had but lighted on this loveable girl for himself,
and had the happiness to make her loving as well as loveable!

‘I can’t bear the sight of him, John,’ said his wife.

‘Nobody, surr; sure not a blessed sowl!’  (Irish feminine reply.)

We went downstairs, followed by Mr. Snagsby, as I soon found the
little man to be. In the front kitchen, sitting by the fire, was Mrs.
Snagsby, with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face.

‘Smell it, father dear,’ said Meg.  ‘Only smell it!’

‘You don’t mean to go yourself, I suppose?’ said Charley with a
humorous leer.

It was a cunning and suspicious idea, quite in the way of his school
of Misers, and he looked very cunning and suspicious as he went jogging
through the streets. More than once or twice, more than twice or thrice,
say half a dozen times, he took his stick from the arm on which he
nursed it, and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head.
Possibly the wooden countenance of Mr Silas Wegg was incorporeally
before him at those moments, for he hit with intense satisfaction.

The grey-haired gentleman had roused himself, and was preparing to
withdraw. He answered in the affirmative.

‘Very true, Sir,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass.

"You don't surely mean to say that you have apprehended the burglars?"

"You see, blacksmith," said the sergeant, who had by this time picked
out Joe with his eye, "we have had an accident with these, and I find
the lock of one of 'em goes wrong, and the coupling don't act pretty.
As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over
them?"

1857.

The Miss Forster mentioned in the letter to his sister-in-law, and for
whom the kind and considerate arrangements were suggested, was a sister
of Mr. John Forster, and a lady highly esteemed by Charles Dickens. The
illness from which she was then suffering was a fatal one. She died in
this same year, a few days before Christmas.

“Why do you rest in the rain?” said Harriet, gently.

After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended
the street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his
post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many
cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly
from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of
the wall, in the same manner as he had descended.

R. W. looked at him with surprise, as thinking he had contracted an
unaccountable spite against the poor deceased, and continued: ‘In the
days when Mr John Harmon was being sought out, young George Sampson
certainly was hovering about Bella, and Bella let him hover. But it
never was seriously thought of, and it’s still less than ever to be
thought of now. For Bella is ambitious, Mr Rokesmith, and I think I may
predict will marry fortune. This time, you see, she will have the person
and the property before her together, and will be able to make her
choice with her eyes open. This is my road. I am very sorry to part
company so soon. Good morning, sir!’

‘No information to give, for a reward?’

‘I hope I shall do better soon,’ said Little Dorrit.

No news here. All going on in the regular way. I read in that church I
told you of, about the middle of January. It is wonderfully seated for
two thousand people, and is as easy to speak in as if they were two
hundred. The people are seated in pews, and we let the pews. I stood on
a small platform from which the pulpit will be removed for the
occasion!! I emerge from the vestry!!! Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
another two nights in Boston will follow this coming month of January.
On Friday next I shall have read a fourth of my whole list, besides
having had twelve days' holiday when I first came out. So please God I
shall soon get to the half, and so begin to work hopefully round.

Here Sam sat down with a pleasant smile, and his speech having been
vociferously applauded, the company broke up.

Then your writer, poet, historian, novelist, or what not?  The
Beacon says that "Jones's work is one of the first order."  The
Lamp declares that Jones's tragedy surpasses every work since the
days of Him of Avon."  The Comet asserts that "J's 'Life of Goody
Twoshoes' is a [Greek text omitted], a noble and enduring monument
to the fame of that admirable Englishwoman," and so forth.  But
then Jones knows that he has lent the critic of the Beacon five
pounds; that his publisher has a half share in the Lamp; and that
the Cornet comes repeatedly to dine with him.  It is all very well.
Jones is immortal until he is found out; and then down comes the
extinguisher, and the immortal is dead and buried.  The idea (dies
irae!) of discovery must haunt many a man, and make him uneasy, as
the trumpets are puffing in his triumph.  Brown, who has a higher
place than he deserves, cowers before Smith, who has found him out.
What is the chorus of critics shouting "Bravo"?--a public clapping
hands and flinging garlands?  Brown knows that Smith has found him
out.  Puff, trumpets!  Wave, banners!  Huzza, boys, for the
immortal Brown!  This is all very well," B. thinks (bowing the
while, smiling, laying his hand to his heart); "but there stands
Smith at the window: HE has measured me; and some day the others
will find me out too."  It is a very curious sensation to sit by a
man who has found you out, and who, as you know, has found you out;
or, vice versa, to sit with a man whom YOU have found out.  His
talent?  Bah!  His virtue?  We know a little story or two about his
virtue, and he knows we know it.  We are thinking over friend
Robinson's antecedents, as we grin, bow and talk; and we are both
humbugs together.  Robinson a good fellow, is he?  You know how he
behaved to Hicks?  A good-natured man, is he?  Pray do you remember
that little story of Mrs. Robinson's black eye?  How men have to
work, to talk, to smile, to go to bed, and try and sleep, with this
dread of being found out on their consciences!  Bardolph, who has
robbed a church, and Nym, who has taken a purse, go to their usual
haunts, and smoke their pipes with their companions.  Mr. Detective
Bullseye appears, and says, "Oh, Bardolph!  I want you about that
there pyx business!"  Mr. Bardolph knocks the ashes out of his
pipe, puts out his hands to the little steel cuffs, and walks away
quite meekly.  He is found out.  He must go.  "Good-by, 'Doll
Tearsheet!  Good-by, Mrs. Quickly, ma'am!"  The other gentlemen and
ladies de la societe look on and exchange mute adieux with the
departing friends.  And an assured time will come when the other
gentlemen and ladies will be found out too.

The following is from General Alava's official report of the action:
"Of those who were by the side of the Duke of Wellington, only he and
myself remained untouched in our persons and horses. The rest were all
either killed, wounded, or lost one or more horses. The Duke was
unable to refrain from tears on witnessing the death of so many brave
and honourable men, and the loss of so many friends and faithful
companions."[21]

What other course was left to take? To ‘form her mind’? This was a
common phrase of words which had a fair and promising sound, and I
resolved to form Dora’s mind.

‘Send Mr. Jinks here, directly! Instantly.’

‘Do you want your head broke in a fresh place, Smike?’ demanded his
amiable lady in the same key.

‘Don’t you complain of the expense afterwards,’ said Mrs. Sliderskew,
sulkily.

He had risen, as his father had before him, in the course of life and
death, from Son to Dombey, and for nearly twenty years had been the
sole representative of the Firm. Of those years he had been married,
ten—married, as some said, to a lady with no heart to give him; whose
happiness was in the past, and who was content to bind her broken
spirit to the dutiful and meek endurance of the present. Such idle talk
was little likely to reach the ears of Mr Dombey, whom it nearly
concerned; and probably no one in the world would have received it with
such utter incredulity as he, if it had reached him. Dombey and Son had
often dealt in hides, but never in hearts. They left that fancy ware to
boys and girls, and boarding-schools and books. Mr Dombey would have
reasoned: That a matrimonial alliance with himself _must_, in the
nature of things, be gratifying and honourable to any woman of common
sense. That the hope of giving birth to a new partner in such a House,
could not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition in the breast
of the least ambitious of her sex. That Mrs Dombey had entered on that
social contract of matrimony: almost necessarily part of a genteel and
wealthy station, even without reference to the perpetuation of family
Firms: with her eyes fully open to these advantages. That Mrs Dombey
had had daily practical knowledge of his position in society. That Mrs
Dombey had always sat at the head of his table, and done the honours of
his house in a remarkably lady-like and becoming manner. That Mrs
Dombey must have been happy. That she couldn’t help it.

‘I know that was what you told me.  You needn’t speak, dear.  I
recollect it very well.  It was not likely that I should forget it.
Grandfather, these men suspect that we have secretly left our friends,
and mean to carry us before some gentleman and have us taken care of
and sent back.  If you let your hand tremble so, we can never get away
from them, but if you’re only quiet now, we shall do so, easily.’

‘It is but a few hours,’ he thought to himself, ‘and I can get away the
first thing in the morning.’

"Just then Judy come in to ask Mr. Magan if he would have a second pair
of blankets on his bed.

We had half-an-hour, I think, for tea. When I had money enough, I used
to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread and butter.
When I had none, I used to look at a venison shop in Fleet Street; or
I have strolled, at such a time, as far as Covent Garden Market, and
stared at the pineapples. I was fond of wandering about the Adelphi,
because it was a mysterious place, with those dark arches. I see myself
emerging one evening from some of these arches, on a little public-house
close to the river, with an open space before it, where some
coal-heavers were dancing; to look at whom I sat down upon a bench. I
wonder what they thought of me!

“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’s
way,” said Joe, staring.

How every circumstance of her short, eventful life, came thronging into
her mind, as they travelled on!  Slight incidents, never thought of or
remembered until now; faces, seen once and ever since forgotten; words
scarcely heeded at the time; scenes, of a year ago and those of
yesterday, mixing up and linking themselves together; familiar places
shaping themselves out in the darkness from things which, when
approached, were, of all others, the most remote and most unlike them;
sometimes, a strange confusion in her mind relative to the occasion of
her being there, and the place to which she was going, and the people
she was with; and imagination suggesting remarks and questions which
sounded so plainly in her ears, that she would start, and turn, and be
almost tempted to reply;--all the fancies and contradictions common in
watching and excitement and restless change of place, beset the child.

“I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the
girl—yes, lover and all—instead of her abandoning them, supposing
she remained at Chesney Wold under such circumstances.”

[Sidenote: Miss Hogarth.]

“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”

“And a pretty figure he cuts with it for his pains,” returned the
Uncle. “Listen to me, Wally, listen to me. Look on the mantelshelf.”

It came out in the course of a little conversation, that Doctor Speddie
was acquainted with some friends of Thomas Idle’s, and had, when a young
man, passed some years in Thomas Idle’s birthplace on the other side of
England.  Certain idle labours, the fruit of Mr. Goodchild’s
apprenticeship, also happened to be well known to him.  The lazy
travellers were thus placed on a more intimate footing with the Doctor
than the casual circumstances of the meeting would of themselves have
established; and when Doctor Speddie rose to go home, remarking that he
would send his assistant with the lotion, Francis Goodchild said that was
unnecessary, for, by the Doctor’s leave, he would accompany him, and
bring it back.  (Having done nothing to fatigue himself for a full
quarter of an hour, Francis began to fear that he was not in a state of
idleness.)

"I was doubtful," he returned, "whether I had seen you before."

“Ay, that he shall,” replied the Jew; “and we’ll have a big-wig,
Charley,—one that’s got the greatest gift of the gab,—to carry
on his defence, and he shall make a speech for himself, too, if he
likes, and we’ll read it all in the papers—‘Artful Dodger—shrieks of
laughter—here the court was convulsed’—eh, Charley, eh?”

Ada and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of
place, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on
infinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking
possession of people. The children sulked and stared; the family took
no notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog
bark, which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We
both felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there
was an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend. By
whom or how it could be removed, we did not know, but we knew that.
Even what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such
auditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so
much tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had
referred, we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce
said he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though he had
had no other on his desolate island.

“No, no,” I answered, “how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped
because I thought you were not following what I said.”

Moreover it is to be observed that these are an industrious people, and a
domestic people, and an honest people.  And though we are aware that at
the bidding of Bilkins it is our duty to fall down and worship the
Neapolitans, we make bold very much to prefer the fishing people of our
French watering-place—especially since our last visit to Naples within
these twelvemonths, when we found only four conditions of men remaining
in the whole city: to wit, lazzaroni, priests, spies, and soldiers, and
all of them beggars; the paternal government having banished all its
subjects except the rascals.

‘It’s a very different person indeed,’ replied Flora, ‘with no limbs and
wheels instead and the grimmest of women though his mother.’

They remained at the window, Mother joining them and pitying the
prisoners, until she was seen coming back. She was soon in the room, and
recommended that Arthur, whom she had left calm and composed, should not
be visited that night.

It is four o’clock in the afternoon, and we may go to see our lottery
drawn.  The ceremony takes place every Saturday, in the Tribunale, or
Court of Justice—this singular, earthy-smelling room, or gallery, as
mouldy as an old cellar, and as damp as a dungeon.  At the upper end is a
platform, with a large horse-shoe table upon it; and a President and
Council sitting round—all judges of the Law.  The man on the little stool
behind the President, is the Capo Lazzarone, a kind of tribune of the
people, appointed on their behalf to see that all is fairly conducted:
attended by a few personal friends.  A ragged, swarthy fellow he is: with
long matted hair hanging down all over his face: and covered, from head
to foot, with most unquestionably genuine dirt.  All the body of the room
is filled with the commonest of the Neapolitan people: and between them
and the platform, guarding the steps leading to the latter, is a small
body of soldiers.

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _June 6th, 1856._

But they only pointed to her, as she hurried on; and said, ‘To
desperation!  Learn it from the creature dearest to your heart!’  A
hundred voices echoed it.  The air was made of breath expended in those
words.  He seemed to take them in, at every gasp he drew.  They were
everywhere, and not to be escaped.  And still she hurried on; the same
light in her eyes, the same words in her mouth, ‘Like Lilian!  To be
changed like Lilian!’  All at once she stopped.

“Wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for, do you
think?” asked Sikes. “Come; you should know her better than me. Wot
does it mean?”

“Well, sir,” replies Mr. George, rising erect and looking immense, “I
would rather, if you’ll excuse me, have nothing to do with this.”

“Upon my word and honour,” cried Mr Toots, blurting out his words
through a singular combination of awkward chuckles and emotion, “I’m
even more sorry than I was before. You know, Captain Gills, I—I
positively adore Miss Dombey;—I—I am perfectly sore with loving her;”
the burst with which this confession forced itself out of the unhappy
Mr Toots, bespoke the vehemence of his feelings; “but what would be the
good of my regarding her in this manner, if I wasn’t truly sorry for
her feeling pain, whatever was the cause of it. Mine ain’t a selfish
affection, you know,” said Mr Toots, in the confidence engendered by
his having been a witness of the Captain’s tenderness. “It’s the sort
of thing with me, Captain Gills, that if I could be run over—or—or
trampled upon—or—or thrown off a very high place-or anything of that
sort—for Miss Dombey’s sake, it would be the most delightful thing that
could happen to me.”

“The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words
were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
They were armed. I was not.

This had, ever so grossly and ever so tiresomely, satisfied every one
else; since every one had thrust upon them, had imposed upon them, as
by a great cruel conspiracy, their silliest possibilities; fencing
them in to these, and so not only shutting them out from others, but
mounting guard at the fence, walking round and round outside it, to
see they didn't escape, and admiring them, talking to them, through
the rails, in mere terms of chaff, terms of chucked cakes and
apples--as if they had been antelopes or zebras, or even some superior
sort of performing, of dancing, bear. It had been reserved for Basil
French to strike her as willing to let go, so to speak, a pound or two
of this fatal treasure if he might only have got in exchange for it
an ounce or so more of their so much less obvious and Jess published
personal history. Yes, it described him to say that, in addition to
all the rest of him, and of _his_ personal history, and of his family,
and of theirs, in addition to their social posture, as that of a
serried phalanx, and to their notoriously enormous wealth and crushing
respectability, she might have been ever so much less lovely for him
if she had been only--well, a little prepared to answer questions. And
it wasn't as if quiet, cultivated, earnest, public-spirited, brought
up in Germany, infinitely travelled, awfully like a high-caste
Englishman, and all the other pleasant things, it wasn't as if he
didn't love to be with her, to look at her, just as she was; for he
loved it exactly as much, so far as that footing simply went, as any
free and foolish youth who had ever made the last demonstration of
it. It was that marriage was, for him--and for them all, the serried
Frenches--a great matter, a goal to which a man of intelligence, a
real shy, beautiful man of the world, didn't hop on one foot, didn't
skip and jump, as if he were playing an urchins' game, but toward
which he proceeded with a deep and anxious, a noble and highly just
deliberation.

I meant to write to you last night, but to enable Wills to get away I
had to read a book of Fitzgerald's through before I went to bed.

"If that is your opinion----" Tackleton began.

‘Let him alone, Jukes,’ interposed Abel. ‘He’ll meet his master at the
corner of the walk, and I should like to see how he’ll carry it off.’

There is another great characteristic of the throwing-off young
gentleman, which is, that he ‘happens to be acquainted’ with a most
extraordinary variety of people in all parts of the world. Thus in all
disputed questions, when the throwing-off young gentleman has no
argument to bring forward, he invariably happens to be acquainted with
some distant person, intimately connected with the subject, whose
testimony decides the point against you, to the great—may we say it—to
the great admiration of three young ladies out of every four, who
consider the throwing-off young gentleman a very highly-connected young
man, and a most charming person.

Ah! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. We had talked it over
very often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination
of his childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation
of the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his interest in
Richard’s favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a
gracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of
the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power,
which was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent her compliments
to the young gentleman (to whom she perfectly remembered that she was
allied by remote consanguinity) and trusted that he would ever do his
duty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself.

‘Do you mean the matron in blue, sir?’ asked the colonel, with emphasis.
‘That is Mrs Jefferson Brick, sir.’

"Ah, my dear, 'lovers'--!" He ever so comically attenuated.

Ben admitted the soft impeachment.

‘Nay,’ returned Nicholas, ‘what do you make of my question first? I
asked you--’

He again begged to remark that he had not finished.

Left to himself again with a still higher sense of the importance of
his post, and stimulated to enthusiasm by the special notice and
encouragement of his leader, Barnaby walked to and fro in a delicious
trance rather than as a waking man. The sunshine which prevailed around
was in his mind. He had but one desire ungratified. If she could only
see him now!

A terrible loud scream sounded through the house the minute after she had
opened it, and I found her on the floor lying as if her life was gone.  My
dear I never looked at the face of the letter which was lying, open by
her, for there was no occasion.

I must do Mr. Guppy the further justice of saying that he had looked
more and more ashamed and that he looked most ashamed and very
earnest when he now replied with a burning face, “Upon my word and
honour, upon my life, upon my soul, Miss Summerson, as I am a living
man, I’ll act according to your wish! I’ll never go another step in
opposition to it. I’ll take my oath to it if it will be any
satisfaction to you. In what I promise at this present time touching
the matters now in question,” continued Mr. Guppy rapidly, as if he
were repeating a familiar form of words, “I speak the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so—”

"'Oh dear, what can it be?' exclaimed the poor widow.

[Illustration: "Married the Chief's daughter"]

They had no sooner arrived at this point, than a most violent and
startling knocking was heard at the door; it was not an ordinary double
knock, but a constant and uninterrupted succession of the loudest
single raps, as if the knocker were endowed with the perpetual motion,
or the person outside had forgotten to leave off.

Esther’s Narrative

"Look!" interrupted the other; "see you not some one through the
interval of the trees descending yonder road that winds round the foot
of the nearest mountain?"

"No."

Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and
this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord’s Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.

‘The eldest, the Beauty is here,’ said Traddles, in a low confidential
voice, ‘Caroline. And Sarah’s here--the one I mentioned to you as having
something the matter with her spine, you know. Immensely better! And the
two youngest that Sophy educated are with us. And Louisa’s here.’

Romeo and Juliet, criticisms on, by Dr. Maginn, 57.

‘Certainly, certainly,’ said Calton, with an indescribable air of
self-satisfaction.

‘Gaffer’s out, and his boat’s out. His daughter’s at home, sitting
a-looking at the fire. But there’s some supper getting ready, so
Gaffer’s expected. I can find what move he’s upon, easy enough,
presently.’

‘What have you done with that paper?’ said Sir John.

The chivalrous Twemlow, Knight of the Simple Heart, was not in a
condition to offer any suggestion. He was too penitent, too remorseful.
For the first time in his life he had done an underhanded action, and he
had done wrong. He had secretly interposed against this confiding young
man, for no better real reason than because the young man’s ways were
not his ways.

‘Before you say another word, dear Nicholas,’ said Kate, turning pale,
‘you must hear what I have to tell you. I came on purpose, but I had not
the courage. What you say now, gives me new heart.’ She faltered, and
burst into tears.

She did so always. If a book were read aloud, and there were anything
in the story that pointed at an unkind father, she was in pain for
their application of it to him; not for herself. So with any trifle of
an interlude that was acted, or picture that was shown, or game that
was played, among them. The occasions for such tenderness towards him
were so many, that her mind misgave her often, it would indeed be
better to go back to the old house, and live again within the shadow of
its dull walls, undisturbed. How few who saw sweet Florence, in her
spring of womanhood, the modest little queen of those small revels,
imagined what a load of sacred care lay heavy in her breast! How few of
those who stiffened in her father’s freezing atmosphere, suspected what
a heap of fiery coals was piled upon his head!

“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”

And I very much question,’ added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,
‘whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the
wrong box before they have done with me.’

Mr. Tupman looked at Mr. Pickwick; but, perceiving no encouragement in
that gentleman's widely opened eyes to deny his name, said:

As we went along, partly to hold him in conversation, and partly to
satisfy myself, I asked him about Ham. He said, almost in the same words
as formerly, that Ham was just the same, ‘wearing away his life with
kiender no care nohow for ‘t; but never murmuring, and liked by all’.

‘You know all now,’ she said, raising her eyes to Bella’s. ‘There is
nothing left out. This is my reason for living secret here, with the aid
of a good old man who is my true friend. For a short part of my life
at home with father, I knew of things—don’t ask me what—that I set my
face against, and tried to better. I don’t think I could have done more,
then, without letting my hold on father go; but they sometimes lie heavy
on my mind. By doing all for the best, I hope I may wear them out.’

"I hope you won't take offence at my freedom, sir," said Mrs. Goldstraw;
"but why should you distress yourself about what is to be done?  He may
not be alive now, for anything you know.  And, if he is alive, it's not
likely he can be in any distress.  The, lady who adopted him was a bred
and born lady--it was easy to see that.  And she must have satisfied them
at the Foundling that she could provide for the child, or they would
never have let her take him away.  If I was in your place, sir--please to
excuse my saying so--I should comfort myself with remembering that I had
loved that poor lady whose portrait you have got there--truly loved her
as my mother, and that she had truly loved me as her son.  All she gave
to you, she gave for the sake of that love.  It never altered while she
lived; and it won't alter, I'm sure, as long as _you_ live.  How can you
have a better right, sir, to keep what you have got than that?"

Everybody echoed the sentiment. Mr. Harleigh smiled, and looked
foolish—not an unusual thing with him—hummed’ Behold how brightly
breaks the morning,’ and blushed as red as the fisherman’s nightcap he
was trying on.

The trooper takes him in his arms like a child, lightly raises him,
and turns him with his face more towards the window. “Thank you. You
have your mother’s gentleness,” returns Sir Leicester, “and your own
strength. Thank you.”

‘I should like,’ said the child, ‘to leave my dear love to poor
Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and
cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody
to help him. And I should like to tell him,’ said the child pressing
his small hands together, and speaking with great fervour, ‘that I
was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived
to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven,
might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if
we were both children there together.’

“Mr Dombey, though a most honourable gentleman,” he said, “is so prone
to pervert even facts to his own view, when he is at all opposed, in
consequence of the warp in his mind, that he—can I give a better
instance than this!—he sincerely believes (you will excuse the folly of
what I am about to say; it not being mine) that his severe expression
of opinion to his present wife, on a certain special occasion she may
remember, before the lamented death of Mrs Skewton, produced a
withering effect, and for the moment quite subdued her!”

“It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,” says the
housekeeper, advancing. “It has never been more than a family
anecdote.”

‘Oh!’ said Nicholas, smiling. ‘The prospect of an addition to your
family?’

As to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty
in our way, little Em’ly and I had no such trouble, because we had no
future. We made no more provision for growing older, than we did for
growing younger. We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty,
who used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little
locker side by side, ‘Lor! wasn’t it beautiful!’ Mr. Peggotty smiled at
us from behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing
else. They had something of the sort of pleasure in us, I suppose, that
they might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the Colosseum.

‘I have no doubt, then,’ returned Mr. Pickwick, ‘that you remember him in
those adventures of mine (the Posthumous Papers of our old club, I mean),
although he is only incidentally mentioned; and, if I remember right,
appears but once.’

‘Shall we walk together?’ said Arthur.

‘You are a little chafed, but I can make allowance for that, and am,
fortunately, myself in the very best of tempers. Now, let us see how
circumstances stand. A day or two ago, I mentioned to you, my dear
fellow, that I thought I had discovered--’

“Upon my word, Caddy,” said I, “you are in the general conspiracy to
keep me in a good humour. Well, my dear?”

"He'll do," said the Dodger.

“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”

"Not till the feet are announced," rejoined the bard, "that bring
the strife which maketh peace;" and he resumed the strain with new,
redoubled fire, nor paused till the portal resounded with the summons
of one impatient for admittance.

The señorita presented me in due form to her aunt.

_Illustrated London News_, offers to Dickens from, i. 150

"'I fly!--I make my escape!--I will die sooner. Say not a word more, my
friends. Let me have a travelling carriage to-morrow morning at four
o'clock, and meanwhile leave me to prepare for my journey to Aranjuez.'

‘How did you come to know Lord Frederick, and those other delightful
creatures, child?’ asked Mrs. Wititterly, still eyeing Kate through her
glass.

‘I belong body and soul to my proprietor,’ said Pancks; ‘you saw my
proprietor having his dinner below. But I do a little in the other way,
sometimes; privately, very privately, Miss Dorrit.’

“Captain Cuttle,” returned the Manager, with all possible politeness,
“I must ask you to do me a favour.”

‘You see,’ proceeded Mr Meagles ‘it might put us wrong with our
son-in-law, it might even put us wrong with our daughter, and it might
lead to a great deal of domestic trouble. You see, don’t you?’

I inclined my head in acquiescence.

Finding him in this gentle mood, Mr Pecksniff began to see another way
out of his difficulties, besides the casting overboard of Jonas.

She said it should be done. Was that all?

‘That’s death!’ said he.

‘Do you find for the plaintiff, gentlemen, or for the defendant?’

“Please to bring the child in quick out of the air there,” whispered
the beadle, holding open the inner door of the church.

You know, I think, that I was very averse to going to Plymouth, and
would not have gone there again but for poor Arthur. But on the last
night I read "Copperfield," and positively enthralled the people. It was
a most overpowering effect, and poor Andrew[7] came behind the screen,
after the storm, and cried in the best and manliest manner. Also there
were two or three lines of his shipmates and other sailors, and they
were extraordinarily affected. But its culminating effect was on
Macready at Cheltenham. When I got home after "Copperfield," I found him
quite unable to speak, and able to do nothing but square his dear old
jaw all on one side, and roll his eyes (half closed), like Jackson's
picture of him. And when I said something light about it, he returned:
"No--er--Dickens! I swear to Heaven that, as a piece of passion and
playfulness--er--indescribably mixed up together, it does--er--no,
really, Dickens!--amaze me as profoundly as it moves me. But as a piece
of art--and you know--er--that I--no, Dickens! By ----! have seen the
best art in a great time--it is incomprehensible to me. How is it got
at--er--how is it done--er--how one man can--well? It lays me on
my--er--back, and it is of no use talking about it!" With which he put
his hand upon my breast and pulled out his pocket-handkerchief, and I
felt as if I were doing somebody to his Werner. Katie, by-the-bye, is a
wonderful audience, and has a great fund of wild feeling in her. Johnny
not at all unlike Plorn.

"You can get a character, of course?" said Mr. Pickwick.

“NOT connected?” says Mr. Guppy. “Oh! Not to your ladyship’s
knowledge, perhaps? Ah! But might be? Yes.” After each of these
interrogatories, she has inclined her head. “Very good! Now, this
Miss Barbary was extremely close—seems to have been extraordinarily
close for a female, females being generally (in common life at least)
rather given to conversation—and my witness never had an idea
whether she possessed a single relative. On one occasion, and only
one, she seems to have been confidential to my witness on a single
point, and she then told her that the little girl’s real name was not
Esther Summerson, but Esther Hawdon.”

MORMON AGENT.  No, not Highlanders.  They ain’t interested enough in
universal brotherhood and peace and good will.

‘I am surprised, Steerforth--although your candour does you honour,’
said Mr. Creakle, ‘does you honour, certainly--I am surprised,
Steerforth, I must say, that you should attach such an epithet to any
person employed and paid in Salem House, sir.’

"Grummet, my man, I am afraid this will turn out a bad one for you. Go
and show your hands to the doctor, and he'll ask you a few questions."

‘No,’ replied Mr. Brownlow, ‘I would rather you remained here.’

Mr Feeder was willing to take it for granted. But Mr Toots shook his
head, and wouldn’t hear of that being possible.

_Jer._
 I don't, then, make too free?

“You should get better coals out of your contractors,” said the
apothecary’s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
rusty poker; “these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.”

His hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter, too. He was
on his stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were
trying to overtake nine o'clock.

‘Mr Co. And me, sir,’ observed Chollop, ‘are disputating a piece. He
ought to be slicked up pretty smart to disputate between the Old World
and the New, I do expect?’

Mr Boffin embraced his spouse for these words of wisdom, and then,
congratulating John Rokesmith on the brilliancy of his achievements,
gave him his hand in pledge of their new relations. So did Mrs Boffin.

‘Would the gentleman like this room?’ said a voice, as a little
out-of-the-way door at the foot of the well staircase flew briskly open
and a head popped out.  ‘He’s quite welcome to it.  He’s as welcome as
flowers in May, or coals at Christmas.  Would you like this room, sir?
Honour me by walking in.  Do me the favour, pray.’

“Captain Gills,” said that gentleman, stopping near the bottom of the
stairs, and turning round, “to tell you the truth, I am not in a frame
of mind at the present moment, in which I could see Lieutenant Walters
with that entirely friendly feeling towards him that I should wish to
harbour in my breast. We cannot always command our feelings, Captain
Gills, and I should take it as a particular favour if you’d let me out
at the private door.”

“I cannot as yet make up my mind whether it is prudent to hold open
communication under present circumstances, and on the part of the fair
member of the present company, with Mr. Neville or Miss Helena. I have
reason to know that a local friend of ours (on whom I beg to bestow a
passing but a hearty malediction, with the kind permission of my
reverend friend) sneaks to and fro, and dodges up and down. When not
doing so himself, he may have some informant skulking about, in the
person of a watchman, porter, or such-like hanger-on of Staple. On the
other hand, Miss Rosa very naturally wishes to see her friend Miss
Helena, and it would seem important that at least Miss Helena (if not
her brother too, through her) should privately know from Miss Rosa’s
lips what has occurred, and what has been threatened. Am I agreed with
generally in the views I take?”

‘And the houses--rather,’ said Mark.

Great reports from Dolby and also from Fields! But I keep myself quite
calm, and hold my decision in abeyance until I shall have book, chapter,
and verse before me. Dolby hoped he could leave Uncle Sam on the 11th of
this month.

“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation,
“that a man should never—”

Pressure was so entirely satisfactory to the public mind, and seemed to
make everybody so comfortable, that it might have lasted all day but for
Bar’s having taken the real state of the case into Court at half-past
nine. This led to its beginning to be currently whispered all over
London by about one, that Mr Merdle had killed himself. Pressure,
however, so far from being overthrown by the discovery, became a greater
favourite than ever. There was a general moralising upon Pressure, in
every street. All the people who had tried to make money and had not
been able to do it, said, There you were! You no sooner began to devote
yourself to the pursuit of wealth than you got Pressure. The idle people
improved the occasion in a similar manner. See, said they, what you
brought yourself to by work, work, work! You persisted in working, you
overdid it. Pressure came on, and you were done for! This consideration
was very potent in many quarters, but nowhere more so than among the
young clerks and partners who had never been in the slightest danger
of overdoing it. These, one and all, declared, quite piously, that they
hoped they would never forget the warning as long as they lived, and
that their conduct might be so regulated as to keep off Pressure, and
preserve them, a comfort to their friends, for many years.

‘No, sir,’ said my aunt. ‘Certainly not!’ With which she pushed me into
a corner near her, and fenced Me in with a chair, as if it were a prison
or a bar of justice. This position I continued to occupy during the
whole interview, and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone enter the
room.

There was no likelihood of his losing his way, for it lay quite straight
before him, and he had walked into town with Nicholas, and back alone,
almost every day. So, Miss La Creevy and he shook hands with mutual
confidence, and, being charged with more kind remembrances to Mrs. and
Miss Nickleby, Smike started off.

‘Dear old thing!’ said Arabella. ‘Let me wrap this shawl round you, Mr.
Pickwick.’

He looked so grim, as he stood askew, with the knot of his cravat under
his ear, that the thought passed into Clennam’s mind, and not for the
first time by many, could Flintwinch for a purpose of his own have got
rid of Blandois? Could it have been his secret, and his safety, that
were at issue? He was small and bent, and perhaps not actively strong;
yet he was as tough as an old yew-tree, and as crusty as an old jackdaw.
Such a man, coming behind a much younger and more vigorous man, and
having the will to put an end to him and no relenting, might do it
pretty surely in that solitary place at a late hour.

"The attorney cast a still more anxious look at the packet; and his
visitor, untying the string that bound it, disclosed a quantity of
promissory notes, with copies of deeds, and other documents.

So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the
kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he
was completely exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell
into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a
candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with
a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his
pulse, and said he was a great deal better.

‘Leave him to us!’ they cried to Hugh--struggling, as they spoke, to
force a passage backward through the crowd. ‘Leave him to us. Why do you
waste your whole strength on such as he, when a couple of men can finish
him in as many minutes! You lose time. Remember the prisoners! remember
Barnaby!’

With this remark, which seemed superfluous, he shut them out upon
the staircase, and they groped their way into the street again. The
interview had done so little to remove the mystery in which Tom’s
new engagement was involved, and had done so much to thicken it, that
neither could help smiling at the puzzled looks of the other. They
agreed, however, that the introduction of Tom to his new office and
office companions could hardly fail to throw a light upon the subject;
and therefore postponed its further consideration until after the
fulfillment of the appointment they had made with Mr Fips.

Mr. Openshaw had been too busy, all his life, to be introspective.  He
did not know that he had any tenderness in his nature; and if he had
become conscious of its abstract existence, he would have considered it
as a manifestation of disease in some part of his nature.  But he was
decoyed into pity unawares; and pity led on to tenderness.  That little
helpless child—always carried about by one of the three busy women of
the house, or else patiently threading coloured beads in the chair from
which, by no effort of its own, could it ever move; the great grave blue
eyes, full of serious, not uncheerful, expression, giving to the small
delicate face a look beyond its years; the soft plaintive voice dropping
out but few words, so unlike the continual prattle of a child—caught Mr.
Openshaw’s attention in spite of himself.  One day—he half scorned
himself for doing so—he cut short his dinner-hour to go in search of
some toy which should take the place of those eternal beads.  I forget
what he bought; but, when he gave the present (which he took care to do
in a short abrupt manner, and when no one was by to see him) he was
almost thrilled by the flash of delight that came over that child’s face,
and could not help all through that afternoon going over and over again
the picture left on his memory, by the bright effect of unexpected joy on
the little girl’s face.  When he returned home, he found his slippers
placed by his sitting-room fire; and even more careful attention paid to
his fancies than was habitual in those model lodgings.  When Alice had
taken the last of his tea-things away—she had been silent as usual till
then—she stood for an instant with the door in her hand.  Mr. Openshaw
looked as if he were deep in his book, though in fact he did not see a
line; but was heartily wishing the woman would be gone, and not make any
palaver of gratitude.  But she only said:

Captain Cuttle, then, with a gravity suitable to the nature of the
occasion, put down upon the table the two tea-spoons and the
sugar-tongs, the silver watch, and the ready money; and asked Mr
Brogley, the broker, what the damage was.

The Doctor gently brushed the scattered ringlets of the child, aside
from the face and mouth of the mother. Alas how calm they lay there;
how little breath there was to stir them!

“But I like everybody here very much,” pursued Paul, “and I should
grieve to go away, and think that anyone was glad that I was gone, or
didn’t care.”

He kissed her hand again.

“And please, what’s Hulks?” said I.

DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _May 25th, 1849._

‘He must be a very weak, and foolish, and inconsiderate man,’ said
Mrs. Nickleby; ‘blamable indeed--at least I suppose other people would
consider him so; of course I can’t be expected to express any opinion on
that point, especially after always defending your poor dear papa when
other people blamed him for making proposals to me; and to be sure there
can be no doubt that he has taken a very singular way of showing it.
Still at the same time, his attentions are--that is, as far as it goes,
and to a certain extent of course--a flattering sort of thing; and
although I should never dream of marrying again with a dear girl like
Kate still unsettled in life--’

But Hilda was too much agitated to heed these exclamations. She could
see nothing but Randulph and the pretty actress. Nor was she without
embarrassment on her own account; for Mr. Cripps, having recognised her,
pointed her out to his master, and the beau, being much struck with her
beauty, favoured her with a very insolent stare. But if Randulph had
been guilty of disloyalty towards the object of his affections, his
punishment was not long delayed; for, as he handed Kitty into the boat,
which was steadied by the black-muzzled Jack before mentioned, his gaze
encountered that of Hilda, and he was instantly filled with confusion.
He tried to disengage himself from the actress, who, however, sportively
detained him, and, unable to retreat, he cut a most ridiculous figure.
Indeed, he was a little relieved, though he felt how much he should
sink in her esteem, when he saw Hilda bend forward, and order Jacob, who
continued resting on his oars, to pass on. He continued gazing after the
skiff till it was out of sight; but Hilda did not look back.

The maniac marked the destruction of the spot where she thought she
stood by one desperate bound, accompanied by a wild shriek, and
then calmly gazed on her infants as they rolled over the scorching
fragments, and sunk into the abyss of fire below.  "There they go,--
one--two--three--all!" and her voice sunk into low mutterings, and
her convulsions into faint, cold shudderings, like the sobbings of
a spent storm, as she imagined herself to "stand in safety and
despair," amid the thousand houseless wretches assembled in the
suburbs of London on the dreadful nights after the fire, without
food, roof, or raiment, all gazing on the burning ruins of their
dwellings and their property.  She seemed to listen to their
complaints, and even repeated some of them very affectingly, but
invariably answered them with the same words, "But I have lost all
my children--all!"  It was remarkable, that when this sufferer
began to rave, all the others became silent.  The cry of nature
hushed every other cry,--she was the only patient in the house who
was not mad from politics, religion, ebriety, or some perverted
passion; and terrifying as the outbreak of her frenzy always was,
Stanton used to await it as a kind of relief from the dissonant,
melancholy, and ludicrous ravings of the others.

‘Have you seen his Lordship’s mail-cart, Bantam?’ inquired the
Honourable Mr. Crushton, after a short pause, during which young Lord
Mutanhed had been endeavouring to stare Mr. Pickwick out of countenance,
and Mr. Crushton had been reflecting what subject his Lordship could
talk about best.

"Are there many of them?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, dubiously.

‘The moment I have secured your mistress, my dear,’ said a man’s voice
in a strong Irish brogue, ‘you may depend on having the money.’

‘What do you mean by that?’ said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly
manner.

‘Well, I never see sitch an old ghost in all my born days,’ exclaimed
Sam, rubbing the old gentleman’s back, hard enough to set him on fire
with the friction. ‘What are you a-laughin’ at, corpilence?’

“What would you have, mother?”

‘It ain’t Locks as YOU’VE been a reckoning up,’ said Riderhood, when the
schoolmaster’s eyes came back again. ‘No, no!’

_Stev._ No, no. Something else to think of. Good morning. [_Exeunt in
opposite directions._]

‘There is a kind of selfishness,’ said Martin--‘I have learned it in my
own experience of my own breast--which is constantly upon the watch for
selfishness in others; and holding others at a distance, by suspicions
and distrusts, wonders why they don’t approach, and don’t confide, and
calls that selfishness in them. Thus I once doubted those about me--not
without reason in the beginning--and thus I once doubted you, Martin.’

LIBERTY! EQUALITY! FRATERNITY! UNION!

“Never mind,” replied the old lady with great dignity. “Don’t trouble
Mr. Pickwick about an old creetur like me. Nobody cares about me now,
and it’s very nat’ral they shouldn’t.” Here the old lady tossed her
head, and smoothed down her lavender-coloured silk dress, with trembling
hands.

This was a good freshener to my presence of mind as a beginning.  I felt
the words of my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or line by line,
but by the entire page.  I tried to lay hold of them; but they seemed,
if I may so express it, to have put skates on and to skim away from me
with a smoothness there was no checking.

“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all
respects--as he was then?”

GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER, KENT,
                                           _Tuesday, June 29th, 1865._

I was greatly elated by these orders; but my heart smote me for my
selfishness, when I witnessed their effect on Mr. Dick, who was so
low-spirited at the prospect of our separation, and played so ill in
consequence, that my aunt, after giving him several admonitory raps on
the knuckles with her dice-box, shut up the board, and declined to play
with him any more. But, on hearing from my aunt that I should sometimes
come over on a Saturday, and that he could sometimes come and see me
on a Wednesday, he revived; and vowed to make another kite for those
occasions, of proportions greatly surpassing the present one. In the
morning he was downhearted again, and would have sustained himself by
giving me all the money he had in his possession, gold and silver too,
if my aunt had not interposed, and limited the gift to five shillings,
which, at his earnest petition, were afterwards increased to ten. We
parted at the garden-gate in a most affectionate manner, and Mr. Dick
did not go into the house until my aunt had driven me out of sight of
it.

An ancient city, Cloisterham, and no meet dwelling-place for any one
with hankerings after the noisy world. A monotonous, silent city,
deriving an earthy flavour throughout from its Cathedral crypt, and so
abounding in vestiges of monastic graves, that the Cloisterham children
grow small salad in the dust of abbots and abbesses, and make dirt-pies
of nuns and friars; while every ploughman in its outlying fields
renders to once puissant Lord Treasurers, Archbishops, Bishops, and
such-like, the attention which the Ogre in the story-book desired to
render to his unbidden visitor, and grinds their bones to make his
bread.

"Well!" cried the landlord, in an outburst of frankness that had
the appearance of desperation--"I wouldn't sleep in it."

“Upon my word and honour she is,” said Mr Toots. “I—I assure you, Mrs
Blimber, she’s a most extraordinary woman.”

"Nothing's the matter, sir," replied the boy, expanding his mouth to
the whole breadth of his countenance.

Niall placed himself in the van; he moved on; they followed him.

“Because I _don’t_,” said the old lady. “Still, I am quite open to
discussion.”

The Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some
minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and
said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright,
he feared the game was up.

CHAPTER 48. The Flight of Florence

‘Oh, bless you, nothing an’t the matter with me,’ returned Clemency—and
truly too, to judge from her well-soaped face, in which there gleamed as
usual the very soul of good-humour, which, ungainly as she was, made her
quite engaging.  Abrasions on the elbows are not generally understood, it
is true, to range within that class of personal charms called
beauty-spots.  But, it is better, going through the world, to have the
arms chafed in that narrow passage, than the temper: and Clemency’s was
sound and whole as any beauty’s in the land.

There is scarcely a sin in the world
    that is in my eyes such a crying one
              as ingratitude.

Mr. Pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the
first page to the top line of the second, and from the bottom of the
second to the top of the third, and from the bottom of the third to
the top of the fourth; but not the slightest alteration of countenance
afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement
of his son's marriage, which Mr. Pickwick knew was in the very first
half-dozen lines.

Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.

‘The trouble shall be well rewarded, Mr Nadgett.’ Nadgett bowed. ‘There
is a deeper impression of Somebody’s Hoof here, than I had expected, Mr
Nadgett. I may congratulate myself upon your being such a good hand at a
secret.’

The older money-lender wagged his chin and smiled, but he originated no
new remark, and they sat for some little time without speaking. Each was
looking out to take the other at a disadvantage.

_Scro._ I wish to be left alone. Since you ask me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
establishments I have mentioned; they cost enough, and those who are
badly off must go there.

_Scro._ To whom can these allusions refer; Jacob Marley has been dead
these seven years, and surely those whom I have considered my best
friends would not speak of my death so unfeelingly. I suppose, however,
that these conversations have some latent moral for my own improvement,
and as I have now resolved upon a change of life, I shall treasure up
all I see and hear. Lead on, Shadow, I follow! (_Crosses to the opposite
entrance and remains._)

“I would rather you did not mention it to them,” said Harry, hurrying
over his words; “because it might make my mother anxious to write to
me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret
between you and me, and mind you tell me every thing; I depend upon
you.”

‘Sir,’ said Mr. Weller, once more.

It was the poor schoolmaster. No other than the poor schoolmaster.
Scarcely less moved and surprised by the sight of the child than she had
been on recognizing him, he stood, for a moment, silent, without even
the presence of mind to raise her from the ground.

‘All me, uncle!’

A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. “Who’s there?” he
cried in a shrill tone of alarm.

Max meanwhile--ah, you, my darling,
Can his loving words recall--
'Mid the bravest and the noblest,
Braver, nobler, than them all.
How I loved him! how my heart thrilled
When his sword clanked by his side.
When I touched his gold embroidery,
Almost saw him in his pride!

“No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”

‘What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless
he comes upon some business for which he is too late, I don’t know,’ said
Mrs. Sparsit, ‘but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr.
Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it.  If to see him is any part of
the duty I have accepted, I will see him.  Use your own discretion,
Bitzer.’

It did indeed sufficiently stagger him. "It's a lovely idea for the
moment when I was just saying to myself--as soon as I saw you--that
you'd speak the truth for _me_!"

We leave for Naples to-morrow morning by the Peninsular and Oriental
Company's steamer the _Valletta_. I send a sketch of our movements that
I have at last been able to make.

He looked about his own age, and had evidently been accustomed to a
much warmer climate than that of England. He wore the fashionable
evening-dress of the day--that is to say, a blue body-coat with gilt
buttons, a white waistcoat, and tight pantaloons--and carried in his
hand a small gold-headed cane.

"Where?" said Mr. Snodgrass.

“It occurred to me,” hinted Mr. Tartar, “that we might go up the river,
the weather being so delicious and the tide serving. I have a boat of
my own at the Temple Stairs.”

‘It was a girl, surely, whom I saw near you--almost hidden in the dark
corner?’

Satisfied with this assurance, Mr. Pickwick once more drew his head into
the chaise and pulled up the glass; but he had scarcely resumed the
conversation which Mr. Bob Sawyer had interrupted, when he was somewhat
startled by the apparition of a small dark body, of an oblong form, on
the outside of the window, which gave sundry taps against it, as if
impatient of admission.

That's right! You will find the words come back very quickly. Why, _of
course_ your people are to come, and if Stanfield don't astonish 'em,
I'm a Dutchman. O Heaven, if you could hear the ideas he proposes to me,
making even _my_ hair stand on end!

“Are you—forgive my asking—poor?”

"Stand aside, then. Now for it."

Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the
family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry
and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long
before Sunday he said.

"Oh, Ham!" she exclaimed, still weeping pitifully, "I am not as good a
girl as I ought to be! I know I have not the thankful heart, sometimes,
I ought to have!"

‘Much business?’

CHAPTER 21. Mr Merdle’s Complaint

‘This is the place,’ said the old man.  ‘Give me your hand while you
throw back the cover, lest you should stumble and fall in.  I am too
old--I mean rheumatic--to stoop, myself.’

Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
hour, and had scarcely completed the slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble,
who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned, and,
telling him it was a board night, took him before that august body
forthwith.

Clemency nodded.  ‘And a nutmeg-grater.’

And once (the boy remembered
That morning, many a day--
The dew lay on the hawthorn,
The bird sang on the spray)
A train of horsemen, nobler
Than he had seen before,
Up from the distance galloped,
And halted at the door.

Steerforth laughed heartily.

“No,” said Mr Feeder.

A biled fowl and baked bread-and-butter pudding brought Mrs. Walmers
up a little; but Boots could have wished, he must privately own to
me, to have seen her more sensible of the woice of love, and less
abandoning of herself to currants. However, Master Harry, he kept up,
and his noble heart was as fond as ever. Mrs. Walmers turned very
sleepy about dusk, and began to cry. Therefore, Mrs. Walmers went off
to bed as per yesterday; and Master Harry ditto repeated.

They took one silent turn backward and forward in the shade of the wall,
getting, at the height on which the quarantine barracks are placed, what
cool refreshment of sea breeze there was at seven in the morning. Mr
Meagles’s companion resumed the conversation.

The cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrified
half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes--a
flash--a loud noise--a smoke--a crash somewhere, but where he knew
not,--and he staggered back.

He produced a little set of tablets and a pencil to facilitate our
conversation, on that our first acquaintance; and I well remember how
awkward and constrained I was in writing down my share of the dialogue,
and how easily he guessed my meaning before I had written half of what I
had to say.  He told me in a faltering voice that he had not been
accustomed to be alone on that day—that it had always been a little
festival with him; and seeing that I glanced at his dress in the
expectation that he wore mourning, he added hastily that it was not that;
if it had been he thought he could have borne it better.  From that time
to the present we have never touched upon this theme.  Upon every return
of the same day we have been together; and although we make it our annual
custom to drink to each other hand in hand after dinner, and to recall
with affectionate garrulity every circumstance of our first meeting, we
always avoid this one as if by mutual consent.

‘Wy, I’ll tell you what, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller, senior, with much
solemnity in his manner; ‘there never was a nicer woman as a widder,
than that ‘ere second wentur o’ mine--a sweet creetur she was, Sammy;
all I can say on her now, is, that as she was such an uncommon pleasant
widder, it’s a great pity she ever changed her condition. She don’t act
as a vife, Sammy.’

‘You have seen me, young lady,’ repeated Rachael, as she did not answer,
‘once before.’

[Mr. Dickens’s last Reading in the United States was given at the
Steinway Hall on the above date.  The task finished he was about to
retire, but a tremendous burst of applause stopped him.  He came forward
and spoke thus:—]

“What do you mean by that?” said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly
manner.

A person who was evidently going to Mr Pecksniff’s house, passed them at
this moment. He raised his eyes at the mention of the architect’s name;
and when he had gone on a few yards, stopped and gazed at them. Mr
Tapley, also, looked over his shoulder, and so did Martin; for the
stranger, as he passed, had looked very sharply at them.

The page disappeared on this errand, and after a short interval, during
which not a word was spoken on either side, opened the door for an
important gentleman of about eight-and-thirty, of rather plebeian
countenance, and with a very light head of hair, who leant over Mrs
Wititterly for a little time, and conversed with her in whispers.

Leon was in despair. He saw he had been premature in so soon declaring
his passion after the news of his wife’s death, and vowed he would not
see Anielka again for several months. To calm his agitation, he had
ridden some miles into the country. When he returned to his hotel after
some hours, he found her note. With the wild delight it had darted into
his soul, he flew back to her.

Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw came from Manchester to London and took the House
To Let.  He had been, what is called in Lancashire, a Salesman for a
large manufacturing firm, who were extending their business, and opening
a warehouse in London; where Mr. Openshaw was now to superintend the
business.  He rather enjoyed the change of residence; having a kind of
curiosity about London, which he had never yet been able to gratify in
his brief visits to the metropolis.  At the same time he had an odd,
shrewd, contempt for the inhabitants; whom he had always pictured to
himself as fine, lazy people; caring nothing but for fashion and
aristocracy, and lounging away their days in Bond Street, and such
places; ruining good English, and ready in their turn to despise him as a
provincial.  The hours that the men of business kept in the city
scandalised him too; accustomed as he was to the early dinners of
Manchester folk, and the consequently far longer evenings.  Still, he was
pleased to go to London; though he would not for the world have confessed
it, even to himself, and always spoke of the step to his friends as one
demanded of him by the interests of his employers, and sweetened to him
by a considerable increase of salary.  His salary indeed was so liberal
that he might have been justified in taking a much larger House than this
one, had he not thought himself bound to set an example to Londoners of
how little a Manchester man of business cared for show.  Inside, however,
he furnished the House with an unusual degree of comfort, and, in the
winter time, he insisted on keeping up as large fires as the grates would
allow, in every room where the temperature was in the least chilly.
Moreover, his northern sense of hospitality was such, that, if he were at
home, he could hardly suffer a visitor to leave the house without forcing
meat and drink upon him.  Every servant in the house was well warmed,
well fed, and kindly treated; for their master scorned all petty saving
in aught that conduced to comfort; while he amused himself by following
out all his accustomed habits and individual ways in defiance of what any
of his new neighbours might think.

“Why didn’t you, blunder-head!” said Kags.

'They have subpoena'd my three friends,' said Mr. Pickwick.

‘The old gentleman?’

"Are you?" said Mr. Omer. "Tell him I was hearty, and sent my respects.
Minnie and Joram's at a ball. They would be as proud to see you as I am,
if they was at home. Minnie won't hardly go out at all, you see, 'on
account of father,' as she says. So I swore to-night, that if she didn't
go, I'd go to bed at six. In consequence of which," Mr. Omer shook
himself and his chair, with laughter at the success of his device, "she
and Joram's at a ball."

[Sidenote: Mr. Peter Cunningham.]

“What was this debt contracted for?” asked Mr Dombey, at length. “Who
is the creditor?”

Anson English favored early marriages, and began to think it would be
better all around if Ben should bring a wife home.

CHAP. XXXIV.   My Aunt astonishes me                           346

“Deary!” said the old woman then. “Alice! Handsome gall Ally!” She
gently shook her sleeve to arouse her attention. “Will you let him go
like that, when you can wring money from him? Why, it’s a wickedness,
my daughter.”

“Well, Sam,” said Mr. Pickwick as that favoured servitor entered his
bed-chamber with his warm water, on the morning of Christmas Day, “Still
frosty?”

The haggard head floated up the dark staircase, and softly descended
nearer to the floor outside the outer door of the chambers. The doors
of the rooms within, appeared to be standing open. There were rays of
candlelight from one of them, and there was the sound of a footstep
going about. There were two voices. The words they uttered were not
distinguishable, but they were both the voices of men. In a few moments
the voices were silent, and there was no sound of footstep, and the
inner light went out. If Lightwood could have seen the face which kept
him awake, staring and listening in the darkness outside the door as
he spoke of it, he might have been less disposed to sleep, through the
remainder of the night.

The prison-yard in which he pauses now, has been the scene of terrible
performances.  Into this narrow, grave-like place, men are brought out to
die.  The wretched creature stands beneath the gibbet on the ground; the
rope about his neck; and when the sign is given, a weight at its other
end comes running down, and swings him up into the air—a corpse.

A silence ensued. After a time, Mr Carker the Manager was heard
rustling among his papers, as if he had resolved to bring the interview
to a conclusion. At the same time his brother withdrew nearer to the
door.

On this sentence being pronounced, Old Lucas foamed at the mouth in
a manner not unlike the over-driven ox, the original cause of his
disaster, and protested, with many disrespectful oaths and other
ebullitions of anger, that he would not pay one farthing; upon which
the magistrate, nothing daunted, commanded him to be locked up
forthwith, which was done to the great delight and admiration, not only
of the friends and other spectators, but of the officers also, who,
besides being in duty bound to express their admiration of all the
magistrate did, participated in the general dislike of Old Lucas, as
the persons best acquainted with his perjury and villany.

The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be
taken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of
manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us
over the burden that clung to her most affectionately.

“No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,” replied the beadle. “Here, I’ve brought
the boy.” Oliver made a bow.

Laura’s first thought that morning had also been of the little orphan,
who had served her so long and faithfully, and whom her father had
commended to her special care. She, too, had risen early, but without
dressing herself, she went across to Sally. Sally was asleep, with the
traces of tears on her cheeks; Laura looked at her for a few moments,
and remembered how, when both were too young to understand the
distinction of rank, they had been almost play-mates; she wiped from her
own eyes a little moisture that dimmed them, then putting her hand
gently on Sally’s shoulder, she said, “Wake, Sally, I call you early
that you may have plenty of time to dress me first and yourself
afterwards. I know you would not like to miss waiting on me, or to do it
hurriedly for the last time. You have been crying, Sally, do not color
about it, I should think ill of you if you were not sorry to leave us,
you cannot feel the parting more than I do. I dare say I shall have hard
work to keep dry eyes all day, but we must do our best, Sally, for it
will not for John to think I grudge you to him, or that you like me
better than you do him.”

However, he gave nothing, but took up his steward's hat instead, and
stood looking into it, as if he had just come into church.  After that he
roamed again, and again said, "This desk, belonging to this house of
Dringworth Brothers, America Square, London City--"

After dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating an
escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, lest
it should offend the master of the house, a coach drove up to the
garden-gate and he went out to receive the visitor. My mother followed
him. I was timidly following her, when she turned round at the parlour
door, in the dusk, and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to
do, whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him. She did
this hurriedly and secretly, as if it were wrong, but tenderly; and,
putting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came near
to where he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and drew
hers through his arm.

Now, where on earth the husband came from, by what feelings the poor
man could have been actuated, or by what process of reasoning the four
Miss Willises succeeded in persuading themselves that it was possible
for a man to marry one of them, without marrying them all, are
questions too profound for us to resolve: certain it is, however, that
the visits of Mr. Robinson (a gentleman in a public office, with a good
salary and a little property of his own, besides) were received—that
the four Miss Willises were courted in due form by the said Mr
Robinson—that the neighbours were perfectly frantic in their anxiety to
discover which of the four Miss Willises was the fortunate fair, and
that the difficulty they experienced in solving the problem was not at
all lessened by the announcement of the eldest Miss Willis,—‘_We_ are
going to marry Mr. Robinson.’

The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that I
was an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.
Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past
six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the
interment on Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon.

“You young scoundrel!” replied Mr Carker, slowly releasing him, and
moving back a step into his favourite position. “What do you mean by
daring to come here?”

‘In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, leading
each away by a hand; ‘what do you do here?’

This was delightful news for me, and I longed to send an immediate
courier to the Shah to inform him of the important fact.

“_You_ thinks Custom ’Us, Jack?” said the landlord.

He remained in the seclusion of his own chamber next morning; but, early
in the afternoon, sent down his best compliments to Mrs General, by Mr
Tinkler, and begged she would accompany Miss Dorrit on an airing
without him. His daughter was dressed for Mrs Merdle’s dinner before he
appeared. He then presented himself in a refulgent condition as to his
attire, but looking indefinably shrunken and old. However, as he was
plainly determined to be angry with her if she so much as asked him how
he was, she only ventured to kiss his cheek, before accompanying him to
Mrs Merdle’s with an anxious heart.

‘Get out!’ retorted Mr. Blathers; ‘I know better. Do you mind that
time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that
was! Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!’

‘Now,’ said Nicholas to the other two, ‘have the goodness to follow your
friend.’

"There you see, Mr. Pickwick," he said, "now I'm complete. I've got my
office coat on, and my pad out, and let him come as soon as he likes.
You haven't got a pinch of snuff about you, have you?"

Mr. Nupkins looked at Mr. Pickwick with a gaze of intense astonishment,
at his displaying such unwonted temerity; and was apparently about to
return a very angry reply, when Mr. Jinks pulled him by the sleeve,
and whispered something in his ear. To this, the magistrate returned
a half-audible answer, and then the whispering was renewed. Jinks was
evidently remonstrating.

“Yes, my Lord.”

“If I have not,” pursues Sir Leicester, “in the most emphatic manner,
adjured you, officer, to exercise your utmost skill in this atrocious
case, I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of
rectifying any omission I may have made. Let no expense be a
consideration. I am prepared to defray all charges. You can incur
none in pursuit of the object you have undertaken that I shall
hesitate for a moment to bear.”

Mrs. Micawber shook her head, and dropped a pious tear upon the twin who
happened to be in hand.

‘What name was it, as I wrote up in the cart, sir?’ said Mr. Barkis,
with a slow rheumatic smile.

‘Yes, Jenny, yes.’ But Riah glanced towards the door, as if he thought
his principal might appear there, unseasonably.

She said at dinner:

'Partly open, my Lord,' said Serjeant Snubbin.

There was, without doubt; for Mr. Winkle was so very much astonished at
the extraordinary behaviour of the medical gentleman, that he
involuntarily retreated towards the door, and looked very much disturbed
at his strange reception.

‘Oh! Mr. Calton, will you lead Mrs. Maplesone?—Thank you.’ Mr. Simpson
offered his arm to Miss Julia; Mr. Septimus Hicks escorted the lovely
Matilda; and the procession proceeded to the dining-room. Mr. Tibbs was
introduced, and Mr. Tibbs bobbed up and down to the three ladies like a
figure in a Dutch clock, with a powerful spring in the middle of his
body, and then dived rapidly into his seat at the bottom of the table,
delighted to screen himself behind a soup-tureen, which he could just
see over, and that was all. The boarders were seated, a lady and
gentleman alternately, like the layers of bread and meat in a plate of
sandwiches; and then Mrs. Tibbs directed James to take off the covers.
Salmon, lobster-sauce, giblet-soup, and the usual accompaniments were
discovered: potatoes like petrifactions, and bits of toasted bread, the
shape and size of blank dice.

‘Oh dear, no!’ said Traddles, stroking his chin. ‘The two youngest are
only nine and ten. Sophy educates ‘em.’

“Oh! my business was to drive you here--that’s all.”

[Illustration: HIS HEAD AND THROAT WERE BARE, AND, AS HE SPOKE WITH
HELPLESS LOOK STRAYING ALL ROUND, HE TOOK HIS COAT OFF, AND LET IT DROP
ON THE FLOOR--Book 3, chap. xii.]

The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which
Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with
the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel
at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet
shady street near Pentonville. Here, a bed was prepared, without
loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully
and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness
and solicitude that knew no bounds.

‘I couldn’t have believed it, sir’ said Mrs Mann, holding up her
hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. ‘I never see such a hardened
little wretch!’

I am glad to hear about Armatage, and hope that a service begun in a
personal attachment to Plorn may go on well. I shall never be
over-confident in such matters, I think, any more.

The gentleman with the whiskers hummed a tune in the same manner as
before, and pending the arrival of the toast advanced to the front
of the fire, and taking his coat-tails under his arms, looked at his
boots, and ruminated.

“Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
sits there.”

"Why really," replied the clergyman, "it's a very slight affair; and
the only excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is, that I was a
young man at the time. Such as it is, however, you shall hear it if you
wish."

And as the boy brought water,
And loosed the rein, he heard
The sweetest voice that thanked him
In one low gentle word;
She turned her blue eyes from him,
Looked up, and smiled to see
The hanging purple blossoms
Upon the Judas Tree;

‘That’s it, master,’ replied Blathers. ‘This is all about the
robbery, is it?’

There is the House of Industry.  In that branch of it, which is devoted
to the reception of old or otherwise helpless paupers, these words are
painted on the walls: ‘WORTHY OF NOTICE.  SELF-GOVERNMENT, QUIETUDE, AND
PEACE, ARE BLESSINGS.’  It is not assumed and taken for granted that
being there they must be evil-disposed and wicked people, before whose
vicious eyes it is necessary to flourish threats and harsh restraints.
They are met at the very threshold with this mild appeal.  All
within-doors is very plain and simple, as it ought to be, but arranged
with a view to peace and comfort.  It costs no more than any other plan
of arrangement, but it speaks an amount of consideration for those who
are reduced to seek a shelter there, which puts them at once upon their
gratitude and good behaviour.  Instead of being parcelled out in great,
long, rambling wards, where a certain amount of weazen life may mope, and
pine, and shiver, all day long, the building is divided into separate
rooms, each with its share of light and air.  In these, the better kind
of paupers live.  They have a motive for exertion and becoming pride, in
the desire to make these little chambers comfortable and decent.

“Because they’re of no use to me, my dear,” replied the Jew with some
confusion, “not worth the taking; for their looks convict ’em when they
get into trouble, and I lose ’em all. With this boy properly managed,
my dears, I could do what I couldn’t with twenty of them. Besides,”
said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, “he has us now if he
could only give us leg-bail again; and he _must_ be in the same boat
with us. Never mind how he came there, it’s quite enough for my power
over him that he was in a robbery, that’s all I want. Now how much
better this is than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the
way, which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.”

"Not yet? Hey?" repeated Mr. Creakle. "But you will soon. Hey?"

"Lor, Peggotty!" observed my mother, rousing herself from a reverie,
"what nonsense you talk!"

‘MR. BLUNDERUM replied, that, when the biographer took up the pack of
cards at the conclusion of the performance, the animal grunted several
times in a significant manner, and nodding his head as he was accustomed
to do, when gratified.  From these gestures it was understood that he
wished the attendant to keep the cards, which he had ever since done.  He
had not expressed any wish relative to his watch, which had accordingly
been pawned by the same individual.

"Here my listener heaved an involuntary sigh, and, perceiving what he
had done, reddened with confusion. I went on without interruption.

"Come, skin yourself."

"Walk-ER!" exclaimed the boy.

‘Fancy,’ said the captain.

‘Look into my face, Dear heart, Sweet heart!’ said Bertha.  ‘Read it with
your beautiful eyes, and tell me if the truth is written on it.’

These things happen every hour, and we all know it; and yet we felt as
much sorrow when we saw, or fancied we saw—it makes no difference
which—the change that began to take place now, as if we had just
conceived the bare possibility of such a thing for the first time. The
next suit, smart but slovenly; meant to be gay, and yet not half so
decent as the threadbare apparel; redolent of the idle lounge, and the
blackguard companions, told us, we thought, that the widow’s comfort
had rapidly faded away. We could imagine that coat—imagine! we could
see it; we _had_ seen it a hundred times—sauntering in company with
three or four other coats of the same cut, about some place of
profligate resort at night.

“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”

Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered:

‘I never had one,’ he returned, shaking his head.  ‘She’s my brother’s
child: a orphan.  Nine year old, though you’d hardly think it; but she’s
tired and worn out now.  They’d have taken care on her, the
Union—eight-and-twenty mile away from where we live—between four walls
(as they took care of my old father when he couldn’t work no more, though
he didn’t trouble ’em long); but I took her instead, and she’s lived with
me ever since.  Her mother had a friend once, in London here.  We are
trying to find her, and to find work too; but it’s a large place.  Never
mind.  More room for us to walk about in, Lilly!’

"It is required of every man," the Ghost returned, "that the spirit
within him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and
wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do
so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is
me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,
and turned to happiness!"

‘Serjeant Buzfuz and Mr. Skimpin for the plaintiff,’ said the judge,
writing down the names in his note-book, and reading as he wrote; ‘for
the defendant, Serjeant Snubbin and Mr. Monkey.’

You lean from the window, your last pipe reeking whitely into the
darkness, your body full of delicious pains, your mind enthroned
in the seventh circle of content; when suddenly the mood changes,
the weathercock goes about, and you ask yourself one question more:
whether, for the interval, you have been the wisest philosopher or the
most egregious of donkeys? Human experience is not yet able to reply;
but at least you have had a fine moment, and looked down upon all the
kingdoms of the earth. And whether it was wise or foolish, to-morrow's
travel will carry you, body and mind, into some different parish of the
infinite.

‘Are you her schoolmaster as well as her brother’s?—Or perhaps you
would like to be?’ said Eugene.

‘Miss Slowboy,’ said Tackleton.  ‘Will you have the kindness to throw
that in the fire?  Thank’ee.’

THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH
                           A Fairy Tale of Home

“Not yet.”

If the pier had presented a scene of life and bustle to the Tuggses on
their first landing at Ramsgate, it was far surpassed by the appearance
of the sands on the morning after their arrival. It was a fine, bright,
clear day, with a light breeze from the sea. There were the same ladies
and gentlemen, the same children, the same nursemaids, the same
telescopes, the same portable chairs. The ladies were employed in
needlework, or watch-guard making, or knitting, or reading novels; the
gentlemen were reading newspapers and magazines; the children were
digging holes in the sand with wooden spades, and collecting water
therein; the nursemaids, with their youngest charges in their arms,
were running in after the waves, and then running back with the waves
after them; and, now and then, a little sailing-boat either departed
with a gay and talkative cargo of passengers, or returned with a very
silent and particularly uncomfortable-looking one.

"That's the tumbler."

"A Bank-of-England five-pound note, Cobbs."

‘Well, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.

"Sam, be quiet," said Mr. Pickwick.

But how good Skimpin and how ready--

‘Fanny,’ said Parsons impatiently, ‘I wish you’d defer these domestic
reproofs to some more suitable time. Really, my dear, these constant
interruptions are very annoying.’

"Welcome," said their hospitable host, throwing it open and stepping
forward to announce them, "Welcome, gentlemen, to Manor Farm."

‘Any better to-day?’

Mr Lightwood explained further.

We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where
he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.

Another time, in the same place, he fell asleep, and slept quietly for
a long time. Awaking suddenly, he listened, started up, and sat
listening.

‘My dear Mortimer, you are the express picture of contented industry,
reposing (on credit) after the virtuous labours of the day.’

‘At the close of one of these paroxysms, when I had with great
difficulty held him down in his bed, he sank into what appeared to be a
slumber. Overpowered with watching and exertion, I had closed my eyes
for a few minutes, when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder. I awoke
instantly. He had raised himself up, so as to seat himself in bed--a
dreadful change had come over his face, but consciousness had returned,
for he evidently knew me. The child, who had been long since disturbed
by his ravings, rose from its little bed, and ran towards its father,
screaming with fright--the mother hastily caught it in her arms, lest he
should injure it in the violence of his insanity; but, terrified by the
alteration of his features, stood transfixed by the bedside. He grasped
my shoulder convulsively, and, striking his breast with the other hand,
made a desperate attempt to articulate. It was unavailing; he extended
his arm towards them, and made another violent effort. There was a
rattling noise in the throat--a glare of the eye--a short stifled groan-
-and he fell back--dead!’

‘You excite my curiosity, father,’ said Hilda. ‘Why do you wish it
passed?’

‘Bill, my boy!’ said this figure, turning his head towards the door,
‘I’m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you’d given it up: in
which case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!’

"The house is yonder," Scrooge exclaimed. "Why do you point away?"

Through the various stages of rich meats and wines, continual gold and
silver, dainties of earth, air, fire, and water, heaped-up fruits, and
that unnecessary article in Mr Dombey’s banquets—ice—the dinner slowly
made its way: the later stages being achieved to the sonorous music of
incessant double knocks, announcing the arrival of visitors, whose
portion of the feast was limited to the smell thereof. When Mrs Dombey
rose, it was a sight to see her lord, with stiff throat and erect head,
hold the door open for the withdrawal of the ladies; and to see how she
swept past him with his daughter on her arm.

The story contained herein was written by Charles Dickens in 1867. It is
the second of four stories entitled "Holiday Romance" and was published
originally in a children's magazine in America. It purports to be written
by a child aged seven. It was republished in England in "All the Year
Round" in 1868. For this and four other Christmas pieces Dickens received
£1,000.

Lizzie took the pretty little hand that was held out in as pretty a
little frankness.

"In what, then?"

‘Incommoded, certainly,’ returned the young lady, ‘but not tired.’

[3]13, FURNIVAL'S INN, _Tuesday Evening, January 20th, 1837._

As she shrugged her shoulders, Clennam stiffly bowed again. With an
uneasy flush upon his face, and hesitation in his manner, he then said
in a still lower tone than he had adopted yet:

Twemlow, in a stunned condition, feigns to compare the portrait in his
hand with the original looking towards him from his Mephistophelean
corner.

A little longer yet--a little longer,
Shall starry night be beautiful for thee;
And the cold moon shall look through the blue silence,
Flooding her silver path upon the sea.

Calculation, a long, 43

‘Haha!’ he cried, lifting his eyebrows, folding his arms, and leaning
back in his chair. ‘Assuredly, Madame Flintwinch is an oracle! How shall
we interpret the oracle, you and I and the old intriguer? He said that
you were not--? And you burst out and stopped him! What was it you were
not? What is it you are not? Say then, madame!’

‘Why,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I may have formed some ideas upon the
subject, but, as I have never submitted them to the test of experience,
I should be sorry if you were induced to regulate your proceedings by
them.’

MR WEGG LOOKS AFTER HIMSELF

"We are in excellent time," said Mr. Snodgrass, as they climbed the
fence of the first field; "the sun is just going down." Mr. Winkle
looked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability
of his "going down" himself, before long.

Somebody said to me, "Let us go to the theatre, Copperfield!" There was
no bed-room before me, but again the jingling table covered with
glasses; the lamp; Grainger on my right hand, Markham on my left, and
Steerforth opposite--all sitting in a mist, and a long way off. The
theatre? To be sure. The very thing. Come along! But they must excuse me
if I saw everybody out first, and turned the lamp off--in case of fire.

‘Let me see,’ said the boy, ‘I think I’ll hang him in the winder,
because it’s more light and cheerful, and he can see the sky there, if
he looks up very much.  He’s such a one to sing, I can tell you!’

“Promptness, indeed!” replied the beadle. “But what’s the consequence;
what’s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband
sends back word that the medicine won’t suit his wife’s complaint, and
so she shan’t take it—says she shan’t take it, sir! Good, strong,
wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish
labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before—sent ’em for nothing,
with a blackin’-bottle in,—and he sends back word that she shan’t take
it, sir!”

‘I say,’ remonstrated Bob Sawyer, looking in at the coach window, as
they pulled up before the door of the Saracen’s Head, Towcester, ‘this
won’t do, you know.’

‘Here’s the lady, Johnny. And the horse.’

To this end, he lighted up fresh candles and heaped more fuel on the
fire; and having dined off a beefsteak, which he cooked himself in
somewhat of a savage and cannibal-like manner, brewed a great bowl of
hot punch, lighted his pipe, and sat down to spend the evening.

"There are some upon this earth of yours," returned the Spirit, "who
lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride,
ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are
as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived.
Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us."

This gentleman sat on the left hand of Nicholas, to whom he was
introduced by his friend the African Swallower, from the bottom of the
table, with a high eulogium upon his fame and reputation.

And, it being low water, he went out with the tide.

‘The letter is from Mr Clennam, sir--it’s the answer--and the message
was, sir, that Mr Clennam also sent his compliments, and word that he
would do himself the pleasure of calling this afternoon, hoping to see
you, and likewise,’ attention more distracted than before, ‘Miss Amy.’

Now, if the unfortunate Mr. Phunky had sat down when Serjeant Snubbin
had winked at him, or if Serjeant Buzfuz had stopped this irregular
cross-examination at the outset (which he knew better than to do;
observing Mr. Winkle’s anxiety, and well knowing it would, in all
probability, lead to something serviceable to him), this unfortunate
admission would not have been elicited. The moment the words fell from
Mr. Winkle’s lips, Mr. Phunky sat down, and Serjeant Snubbin rather
hastily told him he might leave the box, which Mr. Winkle prepared to do
with great readiness, when Serjeant Buzfuz stopped him.

‘He knows all he cares about it,’ Mr Flintwinch testily urged.

‘Ah,’ said the new-comer, ‘it’s a good thing for both of us, isn’t it?
Company, you see--company--is--is--it’s a very different thing from
solitude--ain’t it?’

‘Hem!—Have you thought at all about your mother, my dear?’

"No," said Mrs. Craggs, ringing a perfect peal upon the little bells.
"Not you, indeed. You wouldn't be worthy of the office, if you had the
candor to."

‘Oh dear, I am not referring to the Doctor! Oh no, poor man! I mean Mr.
Maldon!’

"Have they no refuge or resource?" cried Scrooge.

CATALOGUE OF BOOKS

Newman gave a dogged kind of nod to express an affirmative reply, and,
leaving the room for a few seconds, returned with his hat. Having made
various ineffective attempts to fit the parcel (which was some two feet
square) into the crown thereof, Newman took it under his arm, and
after putting on his fingerless gloves with great precision and nicety,
keeping his eyes fixed upon Mr. Ralph Nickleby all the time, he adjusted
his hat upon his head with as much care, real or pretended, as if it
were a bran-new one of the most expensive quality, and at last departed
on his errand.

‘Ah! so say the gentlefolks who come down here to look about them,’
returned the old man, shaking his head, ‘but I say otherwise.  “It’s a
pretty custom you have in this part of the country,” they say to me
sometimes, “to plant the graves, but it’s melancholy to see these
things all withering or dead.” I crave their pardon and tell them that,
as I take it, ‘tis a good sign for the happiness of the living.  And so
it is.  It’s nature.’

A general hum of admiration interrupted the conversation, and announced
the entrance of nurse with the baby. An universal rush of the young
ladies immediately took place. (Girls are always _so_ fond of babies in
company.)

The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.

‘What!’ exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.

It was on the very same day whose evening set upon the last chapter,
and when Mr Dombey’s world was busiest with the elopement of his wife,
that the window of the room in which the brother and sister sat at
their early breakfast, was darkened by the unexpected shadow of a man
coming to the little porch: which man was Perch the Messenger.

"History of England, The Child's," i. 297

"What do you think of that for a kite?" he said.

I will endeavour to come off my back (and the grass) to do an opening
paper for the starting number of "North and South." I can't positively
answer for such a victory over the idleness into which I have
delightfully sunk, as the achievement of this feat; but let us hope.

Then, looking at the dark road and its uncertain objects, he would have
gradually trailed off again into thinking, ‘Where are we driving, he
and I, I wonder, on the darker road of life? How will it be with us, and
with her, in the obscure distance?’ Thinking of her, he would have been
troubled anew with a reproachful misgiving that it was not even loyal to
her to dislike him, and that in being so easily prejudiced against him
he was less deserving of her than at first.

“He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,” retorted Mrs. Bedwin
indignantly. “I know what children are, sir, and have done these forty
years; and people who can’t say the same shouldn’t say anything about
them—that’s my opinion.”

Her voice was so strange a contrast to what it had been before she had
gone into the fit that Susan hardly recognized it; it was now so
unspeakably soft, so irresistibly pleading, the features too had lost
their fierce expression, and were almost as placid as death. Susan could
not speak, but she carried the little child, and laid it in its mother’s
arms; then as she looked at them, something overpowered her, and she
knelt down, crying aloud,

"No?" said the little man.

‘Sir,’ said Mr. Weller.

“Come, come! Tush, we are alone, and out of everybody’s sight and
hearing. Do you think to frighten me with these tricks of virtue?”

"Because you know," said Mr. Omer, taking himself up, where he had left
off, "whatever _is_ done, I should wish to be a member of. Put me down
for anything you may consider right, and let me know. I never could
think the girl all bad, and I am glad to find she's not. So will my
daughter Minnie be. Young women are contradictory creatures in some
things--her mother was just the same as her--but their hearts are soft
and kind. It's all show with Minnie, about Martha. Why she should
consider it necessary to make any show, I don't undertake to tell you.
But it's all show, bless you. She'd do her any kindness in private. So,
put me down for whatever you may consider right, will you be so good?
and drop me a line where to forward it. Dear me!" said Mr. Omer, "when a
man is drawing on to a time of life, where the two ends of life meet;
when he finds himself, however hearty he is, being wheeled about for the
second time, in a speeches of go-cart; he should be over-rejoiced to do
a kindness if he can. He wants plenty. And I don't speak of myself,
particular," said Mr. Omer, "because, sir, the way I look at it is, that
we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill, whatever age we are, on
account of time never standing still for a single moment. So let us
always do a kindness, and be over-rejoiced. To be sure!"

The trooper returns that this is kindly said and that he WILL bring
Lignum through it somehow. Upon which Mrs. Bagnet, with her cloak,
basket, and umbrella, goes home, bright-eyed again, to the rest of
her family, and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of
mollifying Mr. Smallweed.

STRONG OF PURPOSE

“How’s Gills?” inquired the Captain.

"Ah, to be sure," said Perker, gravely. "You must take the matter in
hand for them, my dear sir. These young men will respect you, when they
would listen to nobody else. You must prevent mischief, my dear sir.
Hot blood, hot blood." And the little man took a warning pinch, and
shook his head doubtfully.

“Very well, mother, he was, if you like,” said Wardle, laughing. “He
_was_ carried away by goblins, Pickwick; and there’s an end of the
matter.”

Mrs Todgers, who was greatly flurried by the preparations, replied in
the affirmative.

‘I think uncle wants a companion, father. He should be attended to, and
looked after.’

I have quite made up my mind that F---- really believes he _does_ know
you personally, and has all his life. He talks to me about you with such
gravity that I am afraid to grin, and feel it necessary to look quite
serious. Sometimes he _tells_ me things about you, doesn't ask me, you
know, so that I am occasionally perplexed beyond all telling, and begin
to think it was he, and not I, who went to America. It's the queerest
thing in the world.

I am not going to copy from the journals of the House the particulars
of the grant proposed as a provision for the Perceval family, nor from
the papers of the day the debates to which the event gave rise. What
I propose to do is, merely to give a few sketches of the attendant
circumstances, which may be thought interesting now, but were lost sight
of then, from the pressure of matter of greater importance.

“Half a dozen years ago, or so,” Mr. Sapsea proceeds, “when I had
enlarged my mind up to—I will not say to what it now is, for that might
seem to aim at too much, but up to the pitch of wanting another mind to
be absorbed in it—I cast my eye about me for a nuptial partner.
Because, as I say, it is not good for man to be alone.”

‘What! I’m a sour grape, am I, cousin?’ said Jonas.

We quickened our steps as we neared home, and all four of us sang
softly--

"Hem!" coughed the turnkey.  "Oh, yes, he was there, sometimes."

‘Bah, bah, bah! I repudiate, for the moment, my politeness, and say,
Lies, lies, lies. You know you suppressed the deed and kept the money.’

In short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense
can’t forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her
countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of
visitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke—an enjoyment
expressed, in her own convivial manner, by an additional tightness of
face, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, which
intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady’s
mirrors when my Lady is not among them.

After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the
amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would
only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly
remarking that if he couldn’t get any more he must accompany him home;
with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The
Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,
attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself
on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the
young lady’s return.

How did Boots happen to know all this? Why, through being
under-gardener. Of course he couldn't be under-gardener, and he always
about, in the summer-time, near the windows on the lawn, a-mowing, and
sweeping, and weeding, and pruning, and this and that, without getting
acquainted with the ways of the family. Even supposing Master Harry
hadn't come to him one morning early, and said, "Cobbs, how should you
spell Norah, if you was asked?" and then began cutting it in print all
over the fence.

‘Not wanting any one, sir?’

Mr. Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence. He looked
steadily at Mr. Grummer for a brief space, and then said emphatically,
‘This is a private room, Sir. A private room.’

Doctors strike!--never heard of such a thing. To be sure, they may
strike a death-blow now and then; but doctors striking was a new sort
of a conspiracy. The French waiters only shrugged up their shoulders
with a "_Que voulez vous, monsieur!_" a most tantalizing reply to a man
who cannot get anything that he wants.

"Wot do you mean?" said Sam.

In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a
benevolent old lady, Oliver’s troubles would have been shortened by
the very same process which had put an end to his mother’s; in other
words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king’s
highway. But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese;
and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot
in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan,
and gave him what little she could afford--and more--with such kind
and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that
they sank deeper into Oliver’s soul, than all the sufferings he had
ever undergone.

"What's the matter?" said the captain.  "What's the matter?

This was the close. She sank rapidly; the delirium left her; but, as
she whispered, she was "clean silly"; it was the lightening before the
final darkness. After having for some time lain still, her eyes shut,
she said, "James!" He came close to her, and, lifting up her calm,
clear, beautiful eyes, she gave him a long look, turned to me kindly
but shortly, looked for Rab but could not see him, then turned to her
husband again, as if she would never leave off looking, shut her eyes,
and composed herself. She lay for some time breathing quick, and
passed away so gently that, when we thought she was gone, James, in
his old-fashioned way, held the mirror to her face. After a long
pause, one small spot of dimness was breathed out; it vanished away,
and never returned, leaving the blank, clear darkness without a stain.
"What is our life? It is even as a vapor, which appeareth for a little
time, and then vanisheth away."

"Oh, decidedly," observed the spinster aunt.

‘Yes,’ said Mr Merdle; ‘yes. There has been a delay.’

‘My! what is this!’ cried Mrs Hominy, opening a little note which was
handed her by her excited gentleman-usher. ‘Do tell! oh, well, now! on’y
think!’

‘Stop!’ said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah’s knee. ‘The kinchin
lay.’

‘Mist Wrayburn? Drection! Fifteen shillings!’

The fact principally urged was, that a disorder had broken out amongst
them, which affected the brain more than any other organ; that it had
taken possession of high and low, rich and poor, master and servant; and
raged with such violence, that it was almost dangerous to go amongst
them, although strangers were said not to catch it. It was neither
cholera, plague, nor heart-ache, and could not be assimilated to any
known disorder in the East. We have no name for it in Persia; in England
it is called _Reform_: and, as it had suddenly attacked the country when
in a state of great health and prosperity, it was supposed that some one
great evil eye had struck it, and that therefore no one could foresee
what might be its mischievous results.

“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.

“You were going to say (but that I interrupted you in spite of myself)
what a quiet life mine is. No whirl and uproar around me, no
distracting commerce or calculation, no risk, no change of place,
myself devoted to the art I pursue, my business my pleasure.”

Miss Pecksniff signified (in confidence) that he contemplated the
introduction of a princely ma; and repeated the sentiment that she
wasn’t blind, and wasn’t quite a fool, and wouldn’t bear it.

‘That’s an unanswerable reason, anyhow,’ said Bob.

"No, sir; not _you_."

XVI      RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED
         BY NANCY

Mr. Pickwick walked on abstractedly, crossed opposite the Mansion House,
and bent his steps up Cheapside. Sam began to wonder where they were
going, when his master turned round, and said--

And he was not sorry for what he had done. He was frightened when he
thought of it--when did he not think of it!--but he was not sorry. He
had had a terror and dread of the wood when he was in it; but being
out of it, and having committed the crime, his fears were now diverted,
strangely, to the dark room he had left shut up at home. He had a
greater horror, infinitely greater, of that room than of the wood. Now
that he was on his return to it, it seemed beyond comparison more dismal
and more dreadful than the wood. His hideous secret was shut up in the
room, and all its terrors were there; to his thinking it was not in the
wood at all.

‘Or as certain as they used to teach at school (the same school where I
picked up so much umbleness), from nine o’clock to eleven, that labour
was a curse; and from eleven o’clock to one, that it was a blessing and
a cheerfulness, and a dignity, and I don’t know what all, eh?’ said
he with a sneer. ‘You preach, about as consistent as they did.
Won’t umbleness go down? I shouldn’t have got round my gentleman
fellow-partner without it, I think. --Micawber, you old bully, I’ll pay
YOU!’

"Even under these and other, similarly
        depressing circumstances, the nightly receipts
        were about £60, the expenses being £80; and on
        the last--an author's--night, there was an
        excellent and enthusiastic house, yielding, to
        the best of my recollection, about £140, but
        certainly between £120 and £140. And with that
        night--the sixth or seventh--the experiment
        ended."

‘You think it justifiable, do you, Copperfield, you who pride yourself
so much on your honour and all the rest of it, to sneak about my place,
eaves-dropping with my clerk? If it had been ME, I shouldn’t have
wondered; for I don’t make myself out a gentleman (though I never was
in the streets either, as you were, according to Micawber), but being
you!--And you’re not afraid of doing this, either? You don’t think at
all of what I shall do, in return; or of getting yourself into
trouble for conspiracy and so forth? Very well. We shall see! Mr.
What’s-your-name, you were going to refer some question to Micawber.
There’s your referee. Why don’t you make him speak? He has learnt his
lesson, I see.’

Always, my dear Blanchard,
                                               Faithfully your Friend.

‘I don’t know, ma’am,’ said Little Dorrit, with perfect frankness.

MY DEAR WHITE,

‘Oh, certainly,’ replied Tom, ‘if you really wish it.’ So he accompanied
Mr Tigg to the retreat in question; on arriving at which place that
gentleman took from his hat what seemed to be the fossil remains of an
antediluvian pocket-handkerchief, and wiped his eyes therewith.

This young woman had but shut the door on retiring again when I bethought
me of adding to my order, the words, ‘with nice vegetables.’  Looking out
at the door to give them emphatic utterance, I found her already in a
state of pensive catalepsy in the deserted gallery, picking her teeth
with a pin.

To pursue this theme is madness. Where are you? When are you coming
home? Where is the man who is to do the work? Does he know that an army
of artificers must be turned in at once, and the whole thing finished
out of hand? O rescue me from my present condition. Come up to the
scratch, I entreat and implore you!

‘I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have
happened, ma’am,’ said Bounderby; ‘and it appears to my poor judgment—’

‘Have you got your flute with you?’

This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who
received it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the
doctor slipped out of the room.

‘I’ve got another novelty, Johnson,’ said Mr. Crummles one morning in
great glee.

‘Mr Pinch,’ said Pecksniff, seating himself with folded arms on one of
the spare beds. ‘I don’t see any snuffers in that candlestick. Will you
oblige me by going down, and asking for a pair?’

‘Oh, our Amy, our Amy!’ said Fanny. ‘What a timid little goose our Amy
is! But this is nothing to laugh at. On the contrary, I am very cross,
my dear.’

Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle are a couple who coddle themselves; and the
venerable Mrs. Chopper is an aider and abettor in the same.

‘Thank you for the compliment,’ said Clennam, ill at ease; ‘you are too,
I hope?’

When the wedding come off, I mounted a coat (blue, and bright buttons),
for the first and last time in all my days, and I give Sophy away with my
own hand.  There were only us three and the gentleman who had had charge
of her for those two years.  I give the wedding dinner of four in the
Library Cart.  Pigeon-pie, a leg of pickled pork, a pair of fowls, and
suitable garden stuff.  The best of drinks.  I give them a speech, and
the gentleman give us a speech, and all our jokes told, and the whole
went off like a sky-rocket.  In the course of the entertainment I
explained to Sophy that I should keep the Library Cart as my living-cart
when not upon the road, and that I should keep all her books for her just
as they stood, till she come back to claim them.  So she went to China
with her young husband, and it was a parting sorrowful and heavy, and I
got the boy I had another service; and so as of old, when my child and
wife were gone, I went plodding along alone, with my whip over my
shoulder, at the old horse's head.

‘In the cause of the right it would. Because it would be unknowingly
sold with the mounds else, and the buyer would get what he was never
meant to have, and never bought. And what would that be, Mr Venus, but
the cause of the wrong?’

The King quite believed, I think, that the army were his friends. He
said as much to Fairfax when that general, Oliver Cromwell, and Ireton,
went to persuade him to return to the custody of the Parliament. He
preferred to remain as he was, and resolved to remain as he was. And
when the army moved nearer and nearer London to frighten the Parliament
into yielding to their demands, they took the King with them. It was a
deplorable thing that England should be at the mercy of a great body of
soldiers with arms in their hands; but the King certainly favoured them
at this important time of his life, as compared with the more lawful
power that tried to control him. It must be added, however, that they
treated him, as yet, more respectfully and kindly than the Parliament
had done. They allowed him to be attended by his own servants, to be
splendidly entertained at various houses, and to see his children—at
Cavesham House, near Reading—for two days. Whereas, the Parliament had
been rather hard with him, and had only allowed him to ride out and
play at bowls.

Poor Kate! she little thought how weak her consolation was, and how soon
she would be undeceived.

‘Have I not patronised you, ma’am?’ demanded Miss Squeers.

‘Miss Pinch is governess here,’ replied the porter.

"What is that to you, since yours will not be of the number?"

A little conceit I acknowledge to, when copied on pale pink, gilt-edged
paper, curiously ornamented with embossed loves and doves, written in
a neat small running-hand, the tails of my letters prettily curled,
plenty of dashes, and very few stops, I was thus headed:

‘How is he now, sir?’ she said.

As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment, and their
blood, like his, had all gone down again, some speculation ensued upon
the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.

‘No woman need have, if she was true to herself,’ rejoined the stout
lady.

The truth seems to be, that Mr. Blenkinsop has found an altogether new
pair of spectacles, which enable him to see in the right direction.
Formerly, he could only look backwards; he now looks forwards to the
grand object that all human eyes should have in view--progressive
improvement.

‘No! Not too partial, Alfred,’ urged the lady, tenderly moved; ‘never
say that.’

The observant matron did not fail to report this conversation to
Charity, who laughed at the time, but treated Mr Moddle that very
evening with increased consideration, and presented her side face to him
as much as possible. Mr Moddle was not less sentimental than usual;
was rather more so, if anything; but he sat and stared at her with
glistening eyes, and seemed grateful.

[15]DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Sunday, October 24th, 1841._

CHAPTER XXXI-ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH

‘Yes.’

His repast ended--if that can be called one, which was a mere ravenous
satisfying of the calls of hunger--he moved his chair towards the
fire again, and warming himself before the blaze which had now sprung
brightly up, accosted her once more.

2ND SPIRIT. Your name alone has cast a gloom upon them. But they are
happy--grateful--pleased with one another.

‘That’s for you, Job Trotter,’ said Sam; and before Mr. Trotter could
offer remonstrance or reply--even before he had time to stanch the
wounds inflicted by the insensible lady--Sam seized one arm and Mr.
Muzzle the other, and one pulling before, and the other pushing behind,
they conveyed him upstairs, and into the parlour.

‘And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course, are they?’
said I.

He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that
was, and what was the matter?

"You are not keeping me up. I generally go to bed late."

It has been already mentioned that the stoppage of the mail-coaches was
to be the signal for a general rising. On the evening of the 23rd, at
Santry, the Belfast mail was burned; the Limerick stopped on the Curragh
of Kildare, and both guard and coachman murdered; the Athlone coach was
destroyed at Lucan, and the Cork mail at Naas.

"Is Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him," was his first remark as they
descended the stairs.

What light is shed upon the world, at this day, from amidst these rugged
Palaces of Florence!  Here, open to all comers, in their beautiful and
calm retreats, the ancient Sculptors are immortal, side by side with
Michael Angelo, Canova, Titian, Rembrandt, Raphael, Poets, Historians,
Philosophers—those illustrious men of history, beside whom its crowned
heads and harnessed warriors show so poor and small, and are so soon
forgotten.  Here, the imperishable part of noble minds survives, placid
and equal, when strongholds of assault and defence are overthrown; when
the tyranny of the many, or the few, or both, is but a tale; when Pride
and Power are so much cloistered dust.  The fire within the stern
streets, and among the massive Palaces and Towers, kindled by rays from
Heaven, is still burning brightly, when the flickering of war is
extinguished and the household fires of generations have decayed; as
thousands upon thousands of faces, rigid with the strife and passion of
the hour, have faded out of the old Squares and public haunts, while the
nameless Florentine Lady, preserved from oblivion by a Painter’s hand,
yet lives on, in enduring grace and youth.

Repeated loud explosions were next heard, threatening each moment to
shake the mill to pieces; while some of the unfortunate Jacobites were
seen springing from a side window upon the waterwheel, and trying to
descend by it. Two others, at the risk of breaking their necks, dropped
from a window facing the river, and endeavoured to gain the vessel
moored beside it. The fugitives on the water-wheel were held in check
by a party of grenadiers, who, having thrown a couple of planks over the
little stream, were enabled to reach them.

However, the cork was drawn, and the milk found not only to be very
fresh indeed, but most suspiciously new. In the latitude of the
Caribbean Islands liquids in general are sufficiently warm, so the
captain could not lay much stress upon that.

“I never was brought afore him,” said Durdles, with anything but the
look of a loyal subject of the mayoralty, “and it’ll be time enough for
me to Honour him when I am. Until which, and when, and where,

No attempt at defiance being made, however, her face gradually relaxed,
and became so pleasant, that I was emboldened to kiss and thank her;
which I did with great heartiness, and with both my arms clasped round
her neck. I then shook hands with Mr. Dick, who shook hands with me a
great many times, and hailed this happy close of the proceedings with
repeated bursts of laughter.

"Good-bye!" said stout John Peerybingle, pulling on his dreadnought
coat. "I shall be back at the old time. Good-bye all!"

"I have no patience with him," observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's
niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.

He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his
friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. The latter
gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:

SETTING TRAPS

‘What does my sister say to that?’

Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower
window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from
the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate
idea of its immense extent.

'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in
the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a
simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton;
but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a
variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before.
I will therefore guess even'; he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode
of reasoning in the school-boy, whom his fellows termed 'Lucky,' what,
in its last analysis, is it?"

There were not many in the great city who thought of Barnaby that day,
otherwise than as an actor in a show which was to take place to-morrow.
But if the whole population had had him in their minds, and had wished
his life to be spared, not one among them could have done so with a
purer zeal or greater singleness of heart than the good locksmith.

Of my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion, without having an idea
of what I want to say, beyond such as may be comprehended in the full
conviction that I haven’t said it. Of our being very sociably and simply
happy (always in a dream though); and of Jip’s having wedding cake, and
its not agreeing with him afterwards.

“I was only saying my prayers.”

"Where that iron came from?  It was NOT from a mine."  I looked at
it again, and examined it attentively.  On raising my eyes in
inquiry--fortunately with an expression of surprise, since what met
my eyes would have startled a cooler man--I saw the fourth
fastening undone!

"And what have you been doing?"

‘You remember me, sir?’ said Clemency, trembling with emotion; ‘I saw
just now you did!  You remember me, that night in the garden.  I was with
her!’

These ducal ups and downs gradually separated the whole nation into the
two parties of York and Lancaster, and led to those terrible civil wars
long known as the Wars of the Red and White Roses, because the red rose
was the badge of the House of Lancaster, and the white rose was the
badge of the House of York.

‘You have wandered from the road, too,’ said the widow, in a tone of
pity.

‘Mr. Lillyvick,’ said Kenwigs, addressing the collector, ‘some friends
here, sir, are very anxious for the honour of--thank you--Mr. and Mrs
Cutler, Mr. Lillyvick.’

As he watched her with another covert look, he saw a certain ambitious
triumph in her face which no assumed coldness could conceal.

The gentleman came in; apologised, with a frank but modest grace, for
not finding Mr. Crisparkle alone; turned to Mr. Crisparkle, and
smilingly asked the unexpected question: “Who am I?”

"BLEAK HOUSE."

Collins, who is not very well, sends his "penitent regards," and says he
is enjoying himself as much as a man with the weight of a broken promise
on his conscience can.

"I am sure you have no occasion to be so, ma'am," I said, "unless you
like."

"Yes, sir," replied Job. "Very much so."

Very pretty she looked, though very angry, as she made herself as
tall as she possibly could (which was not extremely tall), and utterly
renounced her patron with a lofty toss of her rich brown head.

The maimed gasman's foot is much swollen, but he limps about and does
his work. I have doctored him up with arnica. During the "Boy" last
night there was an escape of gas from the side of my top batten, which
caught the copper-wire and was within a thread of bringing down the
heavy reflector into the stalls. It was a very ticklish matter, though
the audience knew nothing about it. I saw it, and the gasman and Dolby
saw it, and stood at that side of the platform in agonies. We all three
calculated that there would be just time to finish and save it; when the
gas was turned out the instant I had done, the whole thing was at its
very last and utmost extremity. Whom it would have tumbled on, or what
might have been set on fire, it is impossible to say.

She affects not to know that his eyes are fastened on her as she droops
her head again; but her whole figure reveals that she knows it uneasily.

"Not the worst of it?"

His Lordship’s mansion I found unpretending, even to obscurity. There
was no porte-cochère, no courtyard, no gilt railings, nor green
verandahs. His Lordship’s hotel was, in fact, only a little slice of
a shop, with one dining-room over it; for which I was told he paid an
enormous rent--some thousands of francs a-year. In his window were
displayed certain English viands pleasant to the sight: a mighty
beef-steak pie just cut; the kidney end of a loin of veal, with real
English stuffing, palpable to sight; some sausages that might have
been pork, and of Epping; some potatoes in their homely brown jackets,
just out at elbows, as your well-done potatoes should be, with their
flannel under-garments peeping through; and a spherical mass, something
of the size and shape of a bombshell, dark in colour, speckled black
and white, and that my beating heart told me was a plum-pudding. A
prodigious Cheshire cheese, rugged as Helvellyn, craggy as Criffell,
filled up the background like a range of yellow mountains. At the base
there were dark forests of bottles branded with the names of Allsopp,
and Bass, and Guinness, and there were cheering announcements framed
and glazed, respecting Pale Ale on draught, L.L. whisky, and Genuine
Old Tom.[B] I rubbed my hands in glee. “Ha! ha!” I said internally.
“Nothing like our British aristocracy, after all. The true stock, sir!
May His Lordship’s shadow never diminish.”

“Like enough,” replied the Jew.

Nicholas returned to the perusal of the book he had been reading, when
the dialogue had gone thus far. Mrs. Nickleby, after stopping a little
for consideration, resumed.

‘Do you think it impossible,’ she asked, in the same cold plotting way,
‘that you might replace the Secretary?’

‘Is that his name?’ asked Martin

Sam had put up the steps, and was preparing to jump upon the box, when
he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder; and looking round,
his father stood before him. The old gentleman's countenance wore a
mournful expression, as he shook his head gravely, and said, in warning
accents:

Some proposals for a reconciliation were made, but were soon abandoned.
In the middle of the month of October, in the year one thousand and
sixty-six, the Normans and the English came front to front. All night
the armies lay encamped before each other, in a part of the country
then called Senlac, now called (in remembrance of them) Battle. With
the first dawn of day, they arose. There, in the faint light, were the
English on a hill; a wood behind them; in their midst, the Royal
banner, representing a fighting warrior, woven in gold thread, adorned
with precious stones; beneath the banner, as it rustled in the wind,
stood King Harold on foot, with two of his remaining brothers by his
side; around them, still and silent as the dead, clustered the whole
English army—every soldier covered by his shield, and bearing in his
hand his dreaded English battle-axe.

"'Yes, but----'

‘_Can _you!’ repeated Mr. Martin, with a smile of pity.

“To be sure,” said Mr. Grewgious, provokingly slowly and internally, as
he kept his eyes on the fire: “I might have known it sooner; she gave
me the opening; but I am such an exceedingly Angular man, that it never
occurred to me; I took all for granted.”

With a few last blessings, a few last dutiful messages to good Mr.
Forley, and a few last friendly hints not to forget next Monday at
dusk, Trottle contrived to struggle through the sickening business of
leave-taking; to get the door opened; and to find himself, to his own
indescribable relief, once more on the outer side of the House To Let.

The day had broken when Gabriel Grub awoke, and found himself lying at
full length on the flat gravestone in the church-yard, with the wicker
bottle lying empty by his side, and his coat, spade, and lantern, all
well whitened by the last night’s frost, scattered on the ground. The
stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated, stood bolt upright
before him, and the grave at which he had worked, the night before, was
not far off. At first he began to doubt the reality of his adventures,
but the acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise, assured
him that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal. He was
staggered again, by observing no traces of footsteps in the snow on
which the goblins had played at leap-frog with the gravestones, but he
speedily accounted for this circumstance when he remembered that being
spirits, they would leave no visible impression behind them. So Gabriel
Grub got on his feet as well as he could, for the pain in his back; and
brushing the frost off his coat, put it on, and turned his face towards
the town.

"What is the matter, love?" said ---- You know whom I mean,--I can't
write her name again.

‘Cavalletto! Give me your hand. You know Lagnier, the gentleman. Touch
the hand of a gentleman!’

"Mr. Luffey!"

[Sidenote: The same.]

“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered. “I know that
what is said between you and me goes no further.”

The locksmith turned, with a start, towards the place from which the
words had come, and looked hurriedly at the people who were hanging on
the ladder and clinging to each other.

Bumble shook his head, as he replied, ‘Obstinate people, Mr.
Sowerberry; very obstinate. Proud, too, I’m afraid, sir.’

"I have called," pursued Obenreizer, "to know if I can be of any use.
Business of my own takes me away for some days to Manchester and
Liverpool.  Can I combine any business of yours with it?  I am entirely
at your disposal, in the character of commercial traveller for the firm
of Wilding and Co."

And how King James snubbed

What time a desperate pilot, who no more
      Amid the waters wild his course could hold,
      Had run his ship upon a fork o' the shore;
      Not then the tempest checked Leander bold,
      For Hero's signal-light her summons told.
      Oh! cruel, faithless light of love! to scout him
      On such a night! to plunge him in the cold
      And hissing waves, that rudely toss and flout him!
    Why could not Hero sleep, while winter raged, without him?

"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,
Jacob?" he demanded, in a faltering voice.

[Illustration: HAMLET'S AUNT BETRAYS THE FAMILY FAILING, AND INDULGES IN
A SOLILOQUY ON "BLOOD"--Chap. xxv.]

"They are more hard with me than ever," sobbed the boy.

I cannot say--I really can_not_ say--that I was glad to see Mr. Micawber
there; but I was glad to see him too, and shook hands with him heartily,
inquiring how Mrs. Micawber was.

It might be only the false mouth, so smooth and wide; and yet there
seemed to lurk beneath the humility and subserviency of this short
speech, a something like a snarl; and, for a moment, one might have
thought that the white teeth were prone to bite the hand they fawned
upon. But the Major thought nothing about it; and Mr Dombey lay
meditating with his eyes half shut, during the whole of the play, which
lasted until bed-time.

‘Halloa there!’ cried a voice from above.

Little Dorrit thought of the competition that was to be entered upon,
and assented very softly.

This was the version of the story given by the ingenious Mr. Coombes,
and in this version Grimaldi was an implicit believer. We are rather
disposed to think that Mr. Coombes might have thrown an additional
light upon the matter by explaining that he had got into the chest
that morning to turn the tables upon his assailants, the more so, as
he received various little presents in the way of compensation for his
imprisonment, with which he expressed himself perfectly satisfied.

‘“Disband them, love,” murmured the baroness.

Believe me I am as much obliged to you for your generous and ready
response to my supposed letter as I should have been if I had really
written it. But I know nothing whatever of it or of "Miss Jeffries,"
except that I have a faint impression of having recently noticed that
name among my begging-letter correspondents, and of having associated it
in my mind with a regular professional hand. Your caution has, I hope,
disappointed this swindler. But my testimony is at your service if you
should need it, and I would take any opportunity of bringing one of
those vagabonds to punishment; for they are, one and all, the most
heartless and worthless vagabonds on the face of the earth.

Mrs. Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy. “You romantic child,”
said she, lightly patting Caddy’s back. “Go along. I am excellent
friends with you. Now, good-bye, Caddy, and be very happy!”

It seems but yesterday—and yet how the gay and laughing faces of that
bright morning have changed and vanished from above ground! Faint
likenesses of some remain about them yet, but they are very faint and
scarcely to be traced. The rest are only seen in dreams, and even they
are unlike what they were, in eyes so old and dim.

Mr. Tupman, by a nod, intimated that his question applied to the
disappointed Rachael.

I did try. In three months more, a year would have passed since the
beginning of my sorrow. I determined to make no resolutions until the
expiration of those three months, but to try. I lived in that valley,
and its neighbourhood, all the time.

She feared he was rather hard to please, he spoke so coldly.

“My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!”

"My dear sir," said the other, shaking hands with him.
"I don't know what to say to such munifi--"

“My belief is my own; and I reserve it, worshipped of my soul!
Circumstances may accumulate so strongly _even against an innocent
man_, that directed, sharpened, and pointed, they may slay him. One
wanting link discovered by perseverance against a guilty man, proves
his guilt, however slight its evidence before, and he dies. Young
Landless stands in deadly peril either way.”

‘Whose?’ they all three cried together.

"I wish we had remained there!"

"Bob," said Grimaldi, "I am very hungry."

*Three objects of form in Pottery:

The funeral of Father Olavida was attended by an extraordinary
circumstance.  He was interred in a neighboring convent; and the
reputation of his sanctity, joined to the interest caused by his
extraordinary death, collected vast numbers at the ceremony.  His
funeral sermon was preached by a monk of distinguished eloquence,
appointed for the purpose.  To render the effect of his discourse
more powerful, the corse, extended on a bier, with its face
uncovered, was placed in the aisle.  The monk took his text from
one of the prophets,--"Death is gone up into our palaces."  He
expatiated on mortality, whose approach, whether abrupt or
lingering, is alike awful to man.--He spoke of the vicisstudes of
empires with much eloquence and learning, but his audience were not
observed to be much affected.--He cited various passages from the
lives of the saints, descriptive of the glories of martyrdom, and
the heroism of those who had bled and blazed for Christ and his
blessed mother, but they appeared still waiting for something to
touch them more deeply.  When he inveighed against the tyrants
under whose bloody persecution those holy men suffered, his hearers
were roused for a moment, for it is always easier to excite a
passion than a moral feeling.  But when he spoke of the dead, and
pointed with emphatic gesture to the corse, as it lay before them
cold and motionless, every eye was fixed, and every ear became
attentive.  Even the lovers, who, under pretense of dipping their
fingers into the holy water, were contriving to exchange amorous
billets, forbore for one moment this interesting intercourse, to
listen to the preacher.  He dwelt with much energy on the virtues
of the deceased, whom he declared to be a particular favorite of
the Virgin; and enumerating the various losses that would be caused
by his departure to the community to which he belonged, to society,
and to religion at large; he at last worked up himself to a
vehement expostulation with the Deity on the occasion.  "Why hast
thou," he exclaimed, "why hast thou, Oh God! thus dealt with us?
Why hast thou snatched from our sight this glorious saint, whose
merits, if properly applied, doubtless would have been sufficient
to atone for the apostasy of St. Peter, the opposition of St. Paul
(previous to his conversion), and even the treachery of Judas
himself?  Why hast thou, Oh God! snatched him from us?"--and a deep
and hollow voice from among the congregation answered,--"Because he
deserved his fate."  The murmurs of approbation with which the
congregation honored this apostrophe half drowned this
extraordinary interruption; and though there was some little
commotion in the immediate vicinity of the speaker, the rest of the
audience continued to listen intently.  "What," proceeded the
preacher, pointing to the corse, "what hath laid thee there,
servant of God?"--"Pride, ignorance, and fear," answered the same
voice, in accents still more thrilling.  The disturbance now became
universal.  The preacher paused, and a circle opening, disclosed
the figure of a monk belonging to the convent, who stood among
them.

“Yes, certainly,” said I. I like to dine--not the sole point of
resemblance between myself and the great Johnson.

Mr. Jarndyce nodded to us, who were only waiting for the signal.
“Come! We will walk that way, my dears. Why not that way as soon as
another!” We were quickly ready and went out. Mr. Skimpole went with
us and quite enjoyed the expedition. It was so new and so refreshing,
he said, for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him!

Mr. Datchery hails with him: “Halloa, Winks!”

There were two persons present, besides the bride and bridegroom elect,
who did but indifferent honour to the toast.  One of these was Dot, too
flushed and discomposed to adapt herself to any small occurrence of the
moment; the other, Bertha, who rose up hurriedly, before the rest, and
left the table.

“Oh! A child!” says Mr. Guppy, throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby
the regular acute professional eye which is thrown on British
jurymen. “Now, ma’am, perhaps you’ll have the kindness to tell us
WHAT child.”

CHAPTER XXV -- WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY

‘Ha, ha!’ laughed Mr Mould. ‘You have been breakfasting at somebody’s
expense this morning, Mrs Gamp.’ But seeing, by the aid of a little
shaving-glass which hung opposite, that he looked merry, he composed his
features and became sorrowful.

‘Ah!’ said that gentleman, smacking his lips, ‘here’s richness! Think of
the many beggars and orphans in the streets that would be glad of this,
little boys. A shocking thing hunger, isn’t it, Mr. Nickleby?’

"'Yes, sir, there's Love Lane.'

"Where is he, my love?" said Scrooge.

I am happy to say that my boy is quite well again. From being in perfect
health he fell into alarming convulsions with the surprise and joy of
our return.

Faithfully yours.

"I told you these were shadows of the things that have
been," said the Ghost. "That they are what they are, do
not blame me!"

“Never any more. I am going to stay with my dear husband. We have
been married above two months. Go home without me, my own Esther; I
shall never go home any more!” With those words my darling drew his
head down on her breast and held it there. And if ever in my life I
saw a love that nothing but death could change, I saw it then before
me.

At last the assailant appeared to get exhausted; his attempts gradually
became weaker and less frequent. Emboldened by this, the family
ventured to the first-floor window, whence they could plainly see
what all agreed was a countryman in a white smock-frock pacing to
and fro in front of the house in all the bitterest rage of excessive
disappointment.

‘You leave the recompense to me?’ said the old man, after a minute’s
silence.

Who shall say Biddy was to blame for shutting her door on so much
depravity? Again, was not her wisdom shown in her behaviour to her
niece? Should she have treated her with the least appearance of
kindness, who, driven like a dog, had the wickedness to stain her
threshold with ingratitude? Had she bestowed a sign of goodness upon
her, she had then deserved it. But, no; she had treated her niece like
a beast of burthen, and how had she returned her affection? Biddy
trembled as she thought of it!

‘He wants money, sorely!’ cried Mr Tigg with excessive sympathy. ‘David,
will you have the goodness to do your very utmost for my friend, who
wants money sorely. You will deal with my friend as if he were myself.
A gold hunting-watch, David, engine-turned, capped and jewelled in
four holes, escape movement, horizontal lever, and warranted to perform
correctly, upon my personal reputation, who have observed it narrowly
for many years, under the most trying circumstances’--here he winked
at Martin, that he might understand this recommendation would have an
immense effect upon the shopman; ‘what do you say, David, to my friend?
Be very particular to deserve my custom and recommendation, David.’

There are Mr. Murdstone, our neighbour Mr. Grayper, Mr. Chillip, and
I. When we go out to the door, the Bearers and their load are in the
garden; and they move before us down the path, and past the elms, and
through the gate, and into the churchyard, where I have so often heard
the birds sing on a summer morning.

‘You’re out of spirits, sir,’ said Brass.  ‘Mr Richard, sir, we should
fall to work cheerfully, and not in a despondent state.  It becomes us,
Mr Richard, sir, to--’

This man was of opinion that the unfortunate subject of their doubts
had been lured into some low infamous den, by persons who had either
previously known or suspected that he had a large sum of money in his
possession; that here he was plundered, and afterwards either murdered
in cold blood, or slain in some desperate struggle to recover his
gold. This conjecture was encouraged by but too many corroboratory
circumstances: the sailor was of a temper easily persuaded: he had all
the recklessness and hardihood of a seafaring man, only increased by
the possession of prize-money and the release from hard work: he had
money, and a very large sum of money, about him, the greater part in
specie, and not in notes, or any security which it would be difficult
or dangerous to exchange: all this was known to his brother and to Mr.
Wroughton, both eye-witnesses of the fact.

‘Ay! she has money in her own right in any case. You have done so well
to-day, Sophronia, that I answer the question, though you know I object
to any such questions. You have done so well to-day, Sophronia, that you
must be tired. Get to bed.’

"I will write to her, my dear."

"No, no, not in Bristol," replied Mr. Ben Allen, jerking his thumb over
his right shoulder; "over that way; down there. But hush! here's Bob.
Not a word, my dear friend, not a word."

I am horribly used up after the Jerrold business. Low spirits, low
pulse, low voice, intense reaction. If I were not like Mr. Micawber,
"falling back for a spring" on Monday, I think I should slink into a
corner and cry.

It was only Ham. The night should have turned more wet since I came in,
for he had a large sou'wester hat on, slouched over his face.

Of this chamber, Nicholas became the tenant; and having hired a few
common articles of furniture from a neighbouring broker, and paid
the first week’s hire in advance, out of a small fund raised by the
conversion of some spare clothes into ready money, he sat himself down
to ruminate upon his prospects, which, like the prospect outside his
window, were sufficiently confined and dingy. As they by no means
improved on better acquaintance, and as familiarity breeds contempt, he
resolved to banish them from his thoughts by dint of hard walking. So,
taking up his hat, and leaving poor Smike to arrange and rearrange the
room with as much delight as if it had been the costliest palace, he
betook himself to the streets, and mingled with the crowd which thronged
them.

“I’ll blind yer, s’elp me! I’ll stone yer eyes out, s’elp me! If I
don’t have yer eyesight, bellows me!” At the same time dodging behind
Durdles, and snarling at Jasper, now from this side of him, and now
from that: prepared, if pounced upon, to dart away in all manner of
curvilinear directions, and, if run down after all, to grovel in the
dust, and cry: “Now, hit me when I’m down! Do it!”

Chapter XLI.

The words referred to a broad, round-shouldered, one-sided old fellow in
mourning, coming comically ambling towards the corner, dressed in a pea
over-coat, and carrying a large stick. He wore thick shoes, and thick
leather gaiters, and thick gloves like a hedger’s. Both as to his dress
and to himself, he was of an overlapping rhinoceros build, with folds
in his cheeks, and his forehead, and his eyelids, and his lips, and his
ears; but with bright, eager, childishly-inquiring, grey eyes, under his
ragged eyebrows, and broad-brimmed hat. A very odd-looking old fellow
altogether.

“Did she speak much?”

And now I come to a very important passage in Oliver’s history, for I
have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,
but which indirectly produced a most material change in all his future
prospects and proceedings.

‘But why,’ said the young man, ‘why run the chance of that occurring
which so nearly happened? If Rose had--I cannot utter that word
now--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever
have forgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!’

Miss Nipper, feeling that the eyes of that integral portion of Europe
which lost itself weekly among the high-backed pews, were upon her,
would have been sufficient embarrassed by this incident, though it had
terminated here; the more so, as the Captain in the front row of the
gallery, was in a state of unmitigated consciousness which could hardly
fail to express to the congregation that he had some mysterious
connection with it. But the extreme restlessness of Mr Toots painfully
increased and protracted the delicacy of her situation. That young
gentleman, incapable, in his state of mind, of remaining alone in the
churchyard, a prey to solitary meditation, and also desirous, no doubt,
of testifying his respect for the offices he had in some measure
interrupted, suddenly returned—not coming back to the pew, but
stationing himself on a free seat in the aisle, between two elderly
females who were in the habit of receiving their portion of a weekly
dole of bread then set forth on a shelf in the porch. In this
conjunction Mr Toots remained, greatly disturbing the congregation, who
felt it impossible to avoid looking at him, until his feelings overcame
him again, when he departed silently and suddenly. Not venturing to
trust himself in the church any more, and yet wishing to have some
social participation in what was going on there, Mr Toots was, after
this, seen from time to time, looking in, with a lorn aspect, at one or
other of the windows; and as there were several windows accessible to
him from without, and as his restlessness was very great, it not only
became difficult to conceive at which window he would appear next, but
likewise became necessary, as it were, for the whole congregation to
speculate upon the chances of the different windows, during the
comparative leisure afforded them by the sermon. Mr Toots’s movements
in the churchyard were so eccentric, that he seemed generally to defeat
all calculation, and to appear, like the conjuror’s figure, where he
was least expected; and the effect of these mysterious presentations
was much increased by its being difficult to him to see in, and easy to
everybody else to see out: which occasioned his remaining, every time,
longer than might have been expected, with his face close to the glass,
until he all at once became aware that all eyes were upon him, and
vanished.

Mr. Winkle responded with a forced smile, and took up the spare gun
with an expression of countenance which a metaphysical rook, impressed
with a foreboding of his approaching death by violence, may be supposed
to assume. It might have been keenness, but it looked remarkably like
misery.

Why, of course Veneering knows that! Of course Veneering knows that if
Podsnap chose to go there, he would be there, in a space of time that
might be stated by the light and thoughtless as a jiffy.

“All this, my dear,” said I. “It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to
take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives—and
yet—Peepy and the housekeeping!”

[[[LANDING OF THE FRENCH INVADERS IN KILLALLA BAY]]]

‘Dear!’ said Fagin. ‘A man need be always emptying a till, or a
pocket, or a woman’s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a
bank, if he drinks it regularly.’

T. SPARKLER.

Pondering in my mind the far-seeing schemes of Thisman and Thatman, and
of the public blessing called Party, for staying the degeneracy, physical
and moral, of many thousands (who shall say how many?) of the English
race; for devising employment useful to the community for those who want
but to work and live; for equalising rates, cultivating waste lands,
facilitating emigration, and, above all things, saving and utilising the
oncoming generations, and thereby changing ever-growing national weakness
into strength: pondering in my mind, I say, these hopeful exertions, I
turned down a narrow street to look into a house or two.

‘No indeed,’ replied Sissy.  ‘He told me that I might come in now, but he
sent me away from the room this morning—or at least—’

It was a trying thing to find people here, waiting for us; and my
jealousy, even of the ladies, knew no bounds. But all of my own
sex--especially one impostor, three or four years my elder, with a red
whisker, on which he established an amount of presumption not to be
endured--were my mortal foes.

Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not
once for breath until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested here,
for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show
of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket, and presented such
a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw
nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in
astonishment.

_Tune_--"Young Charly Reilly."

“I am a-looking as hard as ever I can look,” says Jo with starting
eyes, “and that there’s the wale, the bonnet, and the gownd.”

‘I should have been most happy, I assure you,’ said Hicks, in a tone of
condolence; ‘but, you see, I shall be acting as bridegroom. One
character is frequently a consequence of the other; but it is not usual
to act in both at the same time. There’s Simpson—I have no doubt he’ll
do it for you.’

Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his
misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
and slight, and she believed them over.

Lady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain. The storm soon began to
pass upon its way. The shower greatly abated, the lightning ceased,
the thunder rolled among the distant hills, and the sun began to
glisten on the wet leaves and the falling rain. As we sat there,
silently, we saw a little pony phaeton coming towards us at a merry
pace.

‘Just step there with me,’ said Roker, taking up his hat with great
alacrity; ‘the matter’s settled in five minutes. Lord! why didn’t you
say at first that you was willing to come down handsome?’

“There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?” said Mr.
Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the
shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.

Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic
vinegar--Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and
then went on to say, rather faintly:

Mercury is disposed, as he will presently declare to a
fellow-gentleman in waiting, “to pitch into the young man”; but his
instructions are positive. Therefore he sulkily supposes that the
young man must come up into the library. There he leaves the young
man in a large room, not over-light, while he makes report of him.

“Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!” said the beadle, raising his hand with a show
of authority. “Like what, sir, eh?”

‘No, Pa.’

‘No, no. Don’t!’ said Tom. ‘What nonsense! We can get home very well
alone. I couldn’t think of taking you out.’

I lost no time in opening the parcel he had left with me.  The following
were its contents:—

"You are right, sir," replied Joe; "and, what is more, it works very
badly."

He saw it—Yes!  From the chaise he caught the light, as he turned the
corner by the old church.  He knew the room from which it shone.  He saw
the wintry branches of the old trees between the light and him.  He knew
that one of those trees rustled musically in the summer time at the
window of Marion’s chamber.

"What has happened to him?"

‘But you have NOT,’ cried Tigg. ‘I must persist in that opinion. If you
could have seen me, Mr Pinch, at the head of my regiment on the coast
of Africa, charging in the form of a hollow square, with the women and
children and the regimental plate-chest in the centre, you would not
have known me for the same man. You would have respected me, sir.’

“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.

Sir Mulberry’s hand involuntarily closed upon the decanter, and he
seemed for an instant about to launch it at the head of his challenger.
But he only filled his glass, and laughed in derision.

"Absolutely unassailable."

Are you quite sure, Mr. Macready--and I address myself to you with the
sternness of a man in the pit--are you quite sure, sir, that you do not
view America through the pleasant mirage which often surrounds a thing
that has been, but not a thing that is? Are you quite sure that when you
were here you relished it as well as you do now when you look back upon
it. The early spring birds, Mr. Macready, _do_ sing in the groves that
you were, very often, not over well pleased with many of the new
country's social aspects. Are the birds to be trusted? Again I pause for
a reply.

‘He is such a devilish close chap,’ said Mr. Folair, who had come up a
little before, and now joined in the conversation. ‘Nobody can ever get
anything out of him.’

"Perfectly!" cried Madame Bouclet, "you are right, monsieur.  It is so
genteel of him.  The less relation, the more genteel.  As you say."

"This is my birthday, Pip."

The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.

Yes. He saw her in his mind, exactly as she was. She bore him company
with her pride, resentment, hatred, all as plain to him as her beauty;
with nothing plainer to him than her hatred of him. He saw her
sometimes haughty and repellent at his side, and some times down among
his horse’s feet, fallen and in the dust. But he always saw her as she
was, without disguise, and watched her on the dangerous way that she
was going.

‘I have heard, sir,’ returned Mrs Wilfer, with a dignified bend of her
head, ‘of such being the case.’

‘It’s oncommon kind,’ said Ham.

This ill-luck of the beginning, pursued the play to its close.

[Sidenote: Miss Hogarth.]

‘Mr. Slug has remarked, as an additional instance of the extreme
ingenuity of the steam-engine as applied to purposes of navigation,
that in whatever part of the vessel a passenger’s berth may be
situated, the machinery always appears to be exactly under his pillow.
He intends stating this very beautiful, though simple discovery, to the
association.’

These three groups sat round the fire eyeing each other drily, and
waiting for supper. Only one among them, one of the gentlemen belonging
to the party of three, made advances towards conversation. Throwing out
his lines for the Chief of the important tribe, while addressing himself
to his own companions, he remarked, in a tone of voice which included
all the company if they chose to be included, that it had been a long
day, and that he felt for the ladies. That he feared one of the
young ladies was not a strong or accustomed traveller, and had been
over-fatigued two or three hours ago. That he had observed, from his
station in the rear, that she sat her mule as if she were exhausted.
That he had, twice or thrice afterwards, done himself the honour of
inquiring of one of the guides, when he fell behind, how the lady did.
That he had been enchanted to learn that she had recovered her spirits,
and that it had been but a passing discomfort. That he trusted (by this
time he had secured the eyes of the Chief, and addressed him) he might
be permitted to express his hope that she was now none the worse, and
that she would not regret having made the journey.

This was addressed confidentially to both of us, as the morsel of a hand
came away from the face, and buried itself, arm and all, in the bag
again.

‘Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,’ exclaimed that young gentleman,
disclosing to view a huge pasty; ‘sitch delicate creeturs, with
sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth,
and there’s no occasion to pick ‘em; half a pound of seven and
six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling
water, it’ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and
a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn’t work at all at,
afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,--oh no! Two
half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo’ster;
and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!’

The news of the death of the King of England, to whom I had been
presented, had reached the ears of our Shah; and we were informed that
he was succeeded by his brother, a lord of the sea. Years passed away,
with all their various events, without much intercourse taking place
between Persia and England. England required no longer the friendship of
the Shah, and she therefore turned us over to the Governor of India, for
which she duly received our maledictions; and every one who knew upon
what a footing of intimacy the two nations had stood, said, as he spat
upon the ground, "Pooh! may their house be ruined!" She left our country
to be conquered, our finest provinces to be taken from us, and never
once put her hand out to help us.

‘The clerks,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible
crumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, ‘are trustworthy,
punctual, and industrious, of course?’

He saw, I suppose, that I could not help smiling at the simplicity of
this reply; and added, with a smile upon his own ingenuous face:

“I likes eating, better,” replied the boy.

‘Has he indeed?’ said Mr. Pickwick.

FRANK. I want nothing--I ask nothing of you. Well, I'm sorry to find you
so resolute--we have never had any quarrel--I have made the trial in
homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last--so,
a merry Christmas, uncle.

I had got master of my SECRET just in time to turn these honors to
some little account; otherwise, as is commonly the case, I should
have dined or supped a single time or two round, and then by
TRANSLATING French looks and attitudes into plain English, I should
presently have seen that I had got hold of the couvert* of some
more entertaining guest; and in course of time should have resigned
all my places one after another, merely upon the principle that I
could not keep them.  As it was, things did not go much amiss.

With a hoarse grunt of contempt Mr. Sikes seized the glass and threw
the remainder of its contents into the ashes, as a preparatory ceremony
to filling it again for himself, which he did at once.

|While some of the rebel chiefs endeavoured to evade the first
outbreak of the royalist excitement by seeking a temporary security in
concealment, others, under the persuasion that the negotiations between
the Wexford leaders and the commanding officers of the troops would
lead to a general amnesty, or, perhaps, in the desperation of their
circumstances, remained in their respective homes, and quietly awaited
the fate they knew to be impending. Grogan had retired to his mansion
at Johnstown, while Harvey repaired to Bargy Castle, from whence, as
a peace-offering, he sent some fat cattle to the commanding officer in
Wexford. On the return of the messenger he found that to the chiefs
of the insurgents mercy would not be extended, and quitting his house,
never to revisit it, he set out to join a fellow-unfortunate, who had
vainly endeavoured to remove himself beyond the reach of the vengeance
of the outraged laws.

‘We can say the few words we’ve got to say in here, my dear,’ said
the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; ‘and as there are
holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours,
we’ll set the candle on the stairs. There!’

She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.

"How dear Emily is flirting with the strange gentleman," whispered the
spinster aunt, with true spinster-aunt-like envy, to her brother Mr.
Wardle.

‘Miss Wardle,’ said Mr. Jingle, with affected earnestness, ‘forgive
intrusion--short acquaintance--no time for ceremony--all discovered.’

Of morning, noon, and sunset; night, and the rising of an early moon.
Of long roads temporarily left behind, and a rough pavement reached; of
battering and clattering over it, and looking up, among house-roofs, at
a great church-tower; of getting out and eating hastily, and drinking
draughts of wine that had no cheering influence; of coming forth afoot,
among a host of beggars—blind men with quivering eyelids, led by old
women holding candles to their faces; idiot girls; the lame, the
epileptic, and the palsied—of passing through the clamour, and looking
from his seat at the upturned countenances and outstretched hands, with
a hurried dread of recognising some pursuer pressing forward—of
galloping away again, upon the long, long road, gathered up, dull and
stunned, in his corner, or rising to see where the moon shone faintly
on a patch of the same endless road miles away, or looking back to see
who followed.

I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at
Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert
would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those
seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that
the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the
general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,
was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew
greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by
the hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,
read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about
her grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it
into bed whenever it attracted her notice.

When Walter returned home on the Sunday evening from his long walk, and
its memorable close, he was too much occupied at first by the tidings
he had to give them, and by the emotions naturally awakened in his
breast by the scene through which he had passed, to observe either that
his Uncle was evidently unacquainted with the intelligence the Captain
had undertaken to impart, or that the Captain made signals with his
hook, warning him to avoid the subject. Not that the Captain’s signals
were calculated to have proved very comprehensible, however attentively
observed; for, like those Chinese sages who are said in their
conferences to write certain learned words in the air that are wholly
impossible of pronunciation, the Captain made such waves and flourishes
as nobody without a previous knowledge of his mystery, would have been
at all likely to understand.

"No doubt, Alicia."

Captain Cuttle, without altering his position, signed to Mr Toots not
to mind him; and presently turned round, with his glazed hat thrust
back upon his ears, and his hand composing and smoothing his brown
face.

Stand at the bottom of the great market-place of Pompeii, and look up the
silent streets, through the ruined temples of Jupiter and Isis, over the
broken houses with their inmost sanctuaries open to the day, away to
Mount Vesuvius, bright and snowy in the peaceful distance; and lose all
count of time, and heed of other things, in the strange and melancholy
sensation of seeing the Destroyed and the Destroyer making this quiet
picture in the sun.  Then, ramble on, and see, at every turn, the little
familiar tokens of human habitation and every-day pursuits; the chafing
of the bucket-rope in the stone rim of the exhausted well; the track of
carriage-wheels in the pavement of the street; the marks of
drinking-vessels on the stone counter of the wine-shop; the amphoræ in
private cellars, stored away so many hundred years ago, and undisturbed
to this hour—all rendering the solitude and deadly lonesomeness of the
place, ten thousand times more solemn, than if the volcano, in its fury,
had swept the city from the earth, and sunk it in the bottom of the sea.

"Let him."

"Now mind," he said, as he shook hands with Mr. Pickwick, "we expect to
see you all to-morrow. You have the address?"

Stone, Arthur, i. 436

“What’s your name, boy?” said the gentleman in the high chair.

‘A difficulty!’ repeated Clennam. ‘But the difficulties you have so
wonderfully conquered in the whole business!’ shaking his hand again.

“It is better as it is, my dear, remembering his fate.”

The man retired, and left them alone.

Isabella was gone out, doubtless. I rang the bell. I did not observe
Mrs. Martin, the housekeeper, enter the room,--I was still caressing the
child.

“Then he goes by some other amongst us,” rejoined the girl, “which I
more than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put
into your house on the night of the robbery, I—suspecting this
man—listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.
I found out, from what I heard, that Monks—the man I asked you about,
you know—”

‘“Not one look of love!” she cries.  “Hear me while I declare—”

The girl began to cry, and declared she should lose her place; and I to
swear, for I thought it very likely I should lose mine. But we at length
once more passed the Green, and tore along at the rate of ten miles an
hour, till we set down passengers at the Elephant and Castle. Reader,
do you happen to know a biscuit-shop occupying the corner of the road
to Westminster, opposite the aforesaid Elephant and Castle? There it
was, the Red Rover drew up, and the cad descended to run after a man and
woman, who seemed undetermined whether they would take six-pennyworth
or not. My patience was now quite exhausted. A four-horse Westminster
coach was just starting across the way, and, determined to get a place
in a more expeditious conveyance, I dashed open the door of the omnibus
just as the _conducteur's_ "all right" again set the carriage in motion;
he, having failed in his canvassing, at the same instant jumped on
the step behind the 'bus. The consequences were direful. The cad was
transferred to the pavement by a swingeing blow on the temple from the
opening panel, while I lost my equilibrium, and made a full-length
prostration into mud four inches thick, which formed the bed of the
road. I had fallen face downward, and the infuriated official of the
'bus quickly bestrode me, grasping me by the nape of the neck. I gasped
for breath. Never shall I forget what I then inhaled. To bite the
dust is always disagreeable; but, I can assure you, it is nothing to
a mouthful of mud. Rescued at last by the intervention of the police,
I was permitted to rise. I had no time to dispute the question of
right and wrong; glad enough was I to be allowed to medicate the cad's
promissory black eye with a sovereign; for which I was declared by all
present, and particularly by the man what rides behind the 'homnibus'
"to be a perfect gemman, only a little hasty." Never was a gentleman
in a worse pickle. The road had been creamed by the _reign_ of wet
weather that marks an English summer. Had I been diving in a mud-cart,
or "far into the bowels of the land," through the medium of a ditch in
the neighbouring St. George's Fields, I could not have presented a more
extraordinary appearance. I might have been rated as a forty-shilling
landholder, and rich soil into the bargain. As soon as I could clear my
eyes sufficiently to permit of the exercise of vision, I espied an old
clothes' shop in the distance; and in this welcome retreat I speedily
bestowed myself amid cries of "How are you off for soap?"--"There you
go, stick-in-the-mud!"--"Where did you lie last?" and other specimens
of suburban wit. Having left the admiring gaze of about two hundred
spectators, I obtained a washing-tub and a private room from my
newly-formed acquaintance, Isaacs; and, my ablutions being complete, I
equipped myself in a full suit of black, which, though the habiliments
were rather the worse for wear, fitted me pretty well, and had been,
withal, decently made. I was also supplied with shirt and drawers,
"goot ash new," and a hat which Isaacs swore was only made the week
before, and "cheap ash dirt." I appreciated the simile, but the hat I
could scarcely get on my head; time was however wearing away, and I was
obliged to have it, as well as a pair of Blucher boots, not a Wellington
fitting me in the Jew's whole stock of such articles. I again started.
There happened to be a hackney-coach passing just as I emerged from the
shop. This was fortunate; for, to hide my low boots, Isaacs had strapped
my trousers down so tightly, that, not trusting much to the material, I
thought it might be advisable to avoid walking.

‘Who said with his consent?’ She started to find Jeremiah so near her,
and drew back her head, looking at him with some rising distrust. ‘You
were often enough between us when he would have had me produce it and
I would not, to have contradicted me if I had said, with his consent. I
say, when I suppressed that paper, I made no effort to destroy it, but
kept it by me, here in this house, many years. The rest of the Gilbert
property being left to Arthur’s father, I could at any time, without
unsettling more than the two sums, have made a pretence of finding
it. But, besides that I must have supported such pretence by a direct
falsehood (a great responsibility), I have seen no new reason, in
all the time I have been tried here, to bring it to light. It was a
rewarding of sin; the wrong result of a delusion. I did what I was
appointed to do, and I have undergone, within these four walls, what
I was appointed to undergo. When the paper was at last destroyed--as
I thought--in my presence, she had long been dead, and her patron,
Frederick Dorrit, had long been deservedly ruined and imbecile. He had
no daughter. I had found the niece before then; and what I did for her,
was better for her far than the money of which she would have had no
good.’ She added, after a moment, as though she addressed the watch:
‘She herself was innocent, and I might not have forgotten to relinquish
it to her at my death:’ and sat looking at it.

The English, keeping side by side in a great mass, cared no more for
the showers of Norman arrows than if they had been showers of Norman
rain. When the Norman horsemen rode against them, with their
battle-axes they cut men and horses down. The Normans gave way. The
English pressed forward. A cry went forth among the Norman troops that
Duke William was killed. Duke William took off his helmet, in order
that his face might be distinctly seen, and rode along the line before
his men. This gave them courage. As they turned again to face the
English, some of their Norman horse divided the pursuing body of the
English from the rest, and thus all that foremost portion of the
English army fell, fighting bravely. The main body still remaining
firm, heedless of the Norman arrows, and with their battle-axes cutting
down the crowds of horsemen when they rode up, like forests of young
trees,—Duke William pretended to retreat. The eager English followed.
The Norman army closed again, and fell upon them with great slaughter.

She looked at him with a supercilious glance, that it seemed not worth
her while to protract, and turned away her eyes without speaking.

Best love to dear Mamey and Katey, and to Charley, and to Harry. Any
number of kisses to the noble Plorn.

‘Of what then?’ demanded Ralph.

The next was a very unpropitious morning for a journey--muggy, damp,
and drizzly. The horses in the stages that were going out, and had come
through the city, were smoking so that the outside passengers were
invisible. The newspaper-sellers looked moist, and smelt mouldy; the
wet ran off the hats of the orange-vendors as they thrust their heads
into the coach-windows, and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner.
The Jews with the fifty-bladed penknives shut them up in despair; the
men with the pocket-books made pocket-books of them. Watch-guards and
toasting-forks were alike at a discount, and pencil-cases and sponges
were a drug in the market.

‘Is this here gen’l’m’n troubled with any painful complaint?’ said Sam,
looking to his mother-in-law for explanation.

The fat boy gasped, looked at the bedroom door, gasped again, and wiped
two tears away with the knuckle of each of his forefingers.

‘Down with it!’ echoed Toby. ‘Do you think I don’t know what’s good
for you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.’

‘I mistaken, sir!’ said Young John. ‘_I_ completely mistaken on that
subject! No, Mr Clennam, don’t tell me so. On any other, if you like,
for I don’t set up to be a penetrating character, and am well aware of
my own deficiencies. But, _I_ mistaken on a point that has caused me
more smart in my breast than a flight of savages’ arrows could have
done! _I_ mistaken on a point that almost sent me into my grave, as
I sometimes wished it would, if the grave could only have been made
compatible with the tobacco-business and father and mother’s feelings! I
mistaken on a point that, even at the present moment, makes me take out
my pocket-handkerchief like a great girl, as people say: though I am sure
I don’t know why a great girl should be a term of reproach, for every
rightly constituted male mind loves ‘em great and small. Don’t tell me
so, don’t tell me so!’

‘I’ve heerd somethin’ on it,’ replied Sam.

My preparations for a certain murder that I had to do last night have
rendered me unfit for letter-writing these last few days, or you would
have heard from me sooner. The crime being completely off my mind and
the blood spilled, I am (like many of my fellow-criminals) in a highly
edifying state to-day.

At one period of his life, our bore had an illness.  It was an illness of
a dangerous character for society at large.  Innocently remark that you
are very well, or that somebody else is very well; and our bore, with a
preface that one never knows what a blessing health is until one has lost
it, is reminded of that illness, and drags you through the whole of its
symptoms, progress, and treatment.  Innocently remark that you are not
well, or that somebody else is not well, and the same inevitable result
ensues.  You will learn how our bore felt a tightness about here, sir,
for which he couldn’t account, accompanied with a constant sensation as
if he were being stabbed—or, rather, jobbed—that expresses it more
correctly—jobbed—with a blunt knife.  Well, sir!  This went on, until
sparks began to flit before his eyes, water-wheels to turn round in his
head, and hammers to beat incessantly, thump, thump, thump, all down his
back—along the whole of the spinal vertebræ.  Our bore, when his
sensations had come to this, thought it a duty he owed to himself to take
advice, and he said, Now, whom shall I consult?  He naturally thought of
Callow, at that time one of the most eminent physicians in London, and he
went to Callow.  Callow said, ‘Liver!’ and prescribed rhubarb and
calomel, low diet, and moderate exercise.  Our bore went on with this
treatment, getting worse every day, until he lost confidence in Callow,
and went to Moon, whom half the town was then mad about.  Moon was
interested in the case; to do him justice he was very much interested in
the case; and he said, ‘Kidneys!’  He altered the whole treatment,
sir—gave strong acids, cupped, and blistered.  This went on, our bore
still getting worse every day, until he openly told Moon it would be a
satisfaction to him if he would have a consultation with Clatter.  The
moment Clatter saw our bore, he said, ‘Accumulation of fat about the
heart!’  Snugglewood, who was called in with him, differed, and said,
‘Brain!’  But, what they all agreed upon was, to lay our bore upon his
back, to shave his head, to leech him, to administer enormous quantities
of medicine, and to keep him low; so that he was reduced to a mere
shadow, you wouldn’t have known him, and nobody considered it possible
that he could ever recover.  This was his condition, sir, when he heard
of Jilkins—at that period in a very small practice, and living in the
upper part of a house in Great Portland Street; but still, you
understand, with a rising reputation among the few people to whom he was
known.  Being in that condition in which a drowning man catches at a
straw, our bore sent for Jilkins.  Jilkins came.  Our bore liked his eye,
and said, ‘Mr. Jilkins, I have a presentiment that you will do me good.’
Jilkins’s reply was characteristic of the man.  It was, ‘Sir, I mean to
do you good.’  This confirmed our bore’s opinion of his eye, and they
went into the case together—went completely into it.  Jilkins then got
up, walked across the room, came back, and sat down.  His words were
these.  ‘You have been humbugged.  This is a case of indigestion,
occasioned by deficiency of power in the Stomach.  Take a mutton chop in
half-an-hour, with a glass of the finest old sherry that can be got for
money.  Take two mutton chops to-morrow, and two glasses of the finest
old sherry.  Next day, I’ll come again.’  In a week our bore was on his
legs, and Jilkins’s success dates from that period!

‘Doen’t, Em’ly!’ said Ham, tapping her gently on the shoulder. ‘Doen’t,
my dear! You doen’t ought to cry so, pretty!’

‘Nobody?’ inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might
mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.

[Illustration: AND CREEPING OVER THE TILES, LOOKED OVER THE LOW
PARAPET--Chap. l.]

‘And so should I,’ said Number Two.  ‘Truly thankful, I should.’

MY DEAR MRS. BANCROFT,[36]

‘Little Kate Nickleby!’ cried the voice behind him.

For a few moments they stood motionless. Affery was the first to move,
and she, wringing her hands, pursued her mistress. Next, Jeremiah
Flintwinch, slowly backing to the door, with one hand in a pocket, and
the other rubbing his chin, twisted himself out in his reticent way,
speechlessly. Rigaud, left alone, composed himself upon the window-seat
of the open window, in the old Marseilles-jail attitude. He laid his
cigarettes and fire-box ready to his hand, and fell to smoking.

Chapter LVII.

‘Ah!’ replied his father. ‘Why not?’ and with this remark, which he
uttered in a low voice as though he were discussing some grave question
with himself, he used the little finger--if any of his fingers can
be said to have come under that denomination--of his right hand as a
tobacco-stopper, and was silent again.

“‘At last she is dead?’ said the elder, when I went in.

_Haunted Man._

‘Indeed, Quilp,’ returned his wife.  ‘I’m very sorry--’

‘Oh, Quilp!’ cried his poor little wife, looking up.  ‘How you
frightened me!’

The determined voice of Mrs Clennam echoed ‘Stop!’ Jeremiah had stopped
already.

He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up
and knock. But he made a dash, and did it:

At the end of three months Isabel enclosed an order for three pounds to
Fanny, desiring her to get a Brussels carpet, and if there was a
sufficient remainder, to replace the tea seat.

‘This story that they tell me here, has got abroad then, has it?’ asked
Sir Mulberry, clenching his hands and teeth.

“Go!” exclaimed the Dodger. “Why, where’s your spirit? Don’t you take
any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your
friends, eh?”

"What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!" I remarked.

It was a lonely little village, lying among the quiet country scenes
Nell loved. And here, her grandfather being peaceful and at rest, a
great calm fell upon the spirit of the child. Often she would steal into
the church, and, sitting down among the quiet figures carved upon the
tombs, would think of the summer days and the bright spring-time that
would come; of the rays of sun that would fall in, aslant those sleeping
forms; of the songs of birds, and the sweet air that would steal in.
What if the spot awakened thoughts of death! It would be no pain to
sleep amid such sights and sounds as these. For the time was drawing
nearer every day when Nell was to rest indeed. She never murmured or
complained, but faded like a light upon a summer's evening and died. Day
after day and all day long, the old man, broken-hearted and with no love
or care for anything in life, would sit beside her grave with her straw
hat and the little basket she had been used to carry, waiting till she
should come to him again. At last they found him lying dead upon the
stone. And in the church where they had often prayed and mused and
lingered, hand in hand, the child and the old man slept together.

“Mugby Junction!” said the traveller, pulling up the woollen muffler
round his throat with both hands.  “At past three o’clock of a
tempestuous morning!  So!”

‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ slowly continued the ominous Dumps, ‘I’—(here
Mr. Danton imitated two notes from the French-horn, in a very loud key,
which electrified the nervous toast-proposer, and convulsed his
audience).

This is no ideal sketch. There _used_ to be many old people of this
description; their numbers may have diminished, and may decrease still
more. Whether the course female education has taken of late
days—whether the pursuit of giddy frivolities, and empty nothings, has
tended to unfit women for that quiet domestic life, in which they show
far more beautifully than in the most crowded assembly, is a question
we should feel little gratification in discussing: we hope not.

"Hark to this, ma'am," he returned, slowly and quietly. "You know what
it is to love your child. So do I. If she was a hundred times my child,
I couldn't love her more. You doen't know what it is to lose your child.
I do. All the heaps of riches in the wureld would be nowt to me (if they
was mine) to buy her back! But, save her from this disgrace, and she
shall never be disgraced by us. Not one of us that she's growed up
among, not one of us that's lived along with her, and had her for their
all in all, these many year, will ever look upon her pritty face again.
We'll be content to let her be; we'll be content to think of her, far
off, as if she was underneath another sun and sky; we'll be content to
trust her to her husband,--to her little children p'raps,--and bide the
time when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our God!"

Grimaldi spoke as plainly as his agitation would permit, and related
what had passed.

Under the desperate circumstances of the case, the active brain of the
Colonel, combining with his lawless pursuit (he is a Pirate), suggested
an attack with fireworks. This however, from motives of humanity, was
abandoned as too expensive.

One, two, and three, I give up; for every one knows that with both man
and beast, when a beloved object is in danger, or under the influence
of a natural impulse, or when animated by a blind rage, or pinched
by hunger, instinct alone acts, and timidity vanishes: but let the
excitement cease, and the courage disappears also. When full of food,
the lion flees before the feeblest man; and, when the hunger of the
terrible boa is quite appeased, it may be laid hold of, without danger.
It is equally well known that habit would make us forget the sword
suspended over our heads by a single hair. The soldier, continually in
battle, is as indifferent to bullets as the boy to the flying ball: and
yet the same soldier would shudder at a species of danger that the most
cowardly spy encounters in cold blood, and, in all probability, would
feel real terror if he were compelled to a conflict with a tiger, which
the timid Indian, armed with a short sword, and protected only by a
green shield, will go in search of and subdue. The boldest mariner is
often absurdly fearful in a carriage; and I have known a brave officer
who turned pale whenever he was obliged to leap his horse over a hedge
or a ditch.

“But do you take care of him too,” says Sapsea.

The idea of murder, in such a case, like that of self-destruction in the
great majority of instances, is not a new one.  It may have presented
itself to the disturbed mind in a dim shape and afar off; but it has been
there.  After a quarrel, or with some strong sense upon him of irritation
or discomfort arising out of the continuance of this life in his path,
the man has brooded over the unformed desire to take it.  “Though he
should be hanged for it.”  With the entrance of the Punishment into his
thoughts, the shadow of the fatal beam begins to attend—not on himself,
but on the object of his hate.  At every new temptation, it is there,
stronger and blacker yet, trying to terrify him.  When she defies or
threatens him, the scaffold seems to be her strength and “vantage
ground”.  Let her not be too sure of that; “though he should be hanged
for it”.

The three gentlemen looked at each other with blank faces when these
words were uttered, and Mr Chuckster, doing as he was desired, and
leaping off his stool with something of the excitement of an inspired
prophet whose foretellings had in the fulness of time been realised,
held the door open for the entrance of the wretched captive.

"Humanity," said Britain. "That's the joke."

[Sidenote: M. de Cerjat.]

A very brief conversation ensued. The door was unlocked. Mr. Pickwick
stepped out of the closet, and found himself in the presence of the
whole establishment of Westgate House, Mr. Samuel Weller, and--old
Wardle, and his destined son-in-law, Mr. Trundle!

‘Oh! I don’t know,’ said the man carelessly. ‘I thought that was what
you meant. Being formed for society, and being cut off in your flower,
you know--’

‘Is anybody else a-goin’, Tommy?’ said Mrs. Cluppins, arranging her
pelerine.

Her hand stopped now. She clasped me in her arms, and I clasped her
in mine.

So, without more ado, the red cab-driver knocked the little gentleman
down, and then called the police to take himself into custody, with all
the civility in the world.

‘I should be somewhat ashamed of myself, Clara,’ returned Miss
Murdstone, ‘if I could not understand the boy, or any boy. I don’t
profess to be profound; but I do lay claim to common sense.’

"Good!" said Steerforth. "Come and prove it. We will go and see the
lions for an hour or two--it's something to have a fresh fellow like you
to show them to, Copperfield--and then we'll journey out to Highgate by
the coach."

‘You must dance with Miss Cheggs,’ said Miss Sophy to Dick Swiviller,
after she had herself danced twice with Mr Cheggs and made great show
of encouraging his advances. ‘She’s a nice girl--and her brother’s
quite delightful.’

"What mounted?" I asked.

“No, no; I am sure you won’t. I say you won’t, my pet, my dearest!”
exclaims Susan; “and here’s the Captain too—your friend the Captain,
you know—to say good-bye once more!”

‘I must own,’ returned the dressmaker, with her eyes upon her work,
‘that we are not good friends at present.’

There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where
Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously
through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and
not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight
of stairs. Stumbling against a door on the landing, he rapped at it
with his knuckles.

“Co-o-ol,” the child repeated in a louder voice, lengthening out the word
with a fixed look and great emphasis, as much as to say: “What’s the use
of your having grown up, if you’re such a donkey as not to understand
me?”

They were a good pair to sit breakfasting together in Minor Canon
Corner, Cloisterham. For Minor Canon Corner was a quiet place in the
shadow of the Cathedral, which the cawing of the rooks, the echoing
footsteps of rare passers, the sound of the Cathedral bell, or the roll
of the Cathedral organ, seemed to render more quiet than absolute
silence. Swaggering fighting men had had their centuries of ramping and
raving about Minor Canon Corner, and beaten serfs had had their
centuries of drudging and dying there, and powerful monks had had their
centuries of being sometimes useful and sometimes harmful there, and
behold they were all gone out of Minor Canon Corner, and so much the
better. Perhaps one of the highest uses of their ever having been
there, was, that there might be left behind, that blessed air of
tranquillity which pervaded Minor Canon Corner, and that serenely
romantic state of the mind—productive for the most part of pity and
forbearance—which is engendered by a sorrowful story that is all told,
or a pathetic play that is played out.

"Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing," said Peggotty.

‘My eyes is wrong!’ said Mark. ‘I don’t believe ‘em. That ain’t my
fellow-passenger younder, a-nursing her little girl, who, I am sorry to
see, is so delicate; and that ain’t her husband as come to New York to
fetch her. Nor these,’ he added, looking down upon the boys, ‘ain’t them
two young shavers as was so familiar to me; though they are uncommon
like ‘em. That I must confess.’

‘Eh!’ said the gentleman. ‘What--the--deyvle!’

"The love that it revealeth
    All earthly sorrows healeth,
      They flee like mist before the break of day;
    When, oh, my soul, thou learnest
    This song of songs in earnest
      Thy cares and sorrows all shall flee away."

‘Then why don’t you die?’ said Sir Mulberry.

"'Don't interrupt me,' said the old gentleman. 'Of you, Tom, I
entertain a very different opinion; for I well know that if you once
settled yourself in a public-house, you would never leave it as long as
there was anything to drink within its walls.'

‘With me, sir?’ retorted Sir Mulberry Hawk, eyeing him in disdainful
surprise.

‘Compose yourself, my own angel,’ said Madame. ‘It was nobody’s fault;
it was mine as much as yours, we shall do very well yet. Come, Alfred,
come.’

Hengist and Horsa drove out the Picts and Scots; and Vortigern, being
grateful to them for that service, made no opposition to their settling
themselves in that part of England which is called the Isle of Thanet,
or to their inviting over more of their countrymen to join them. But
Hengist had a beautiful daughter named Rowena; and when, at a feast,
she filled a golden goblet to the brim with wine, and gave it to
Vortigern, saying in a sweet voice, ‘Dear King, thy health!’ the King
fell in love with her. My opinion is, that the cunning Hengist meant
him to do so, in order that the Saxons might have greater influence
with him; and that the fair Rowena came to that feast, golden goblet
and all, on purpose.

‘I say! How nice you look!’

CHAPTER 52 -- IN WHICH THE TABLES ARE TURNED, COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN

‘Oh don’t and oh don’t,’ pursued Miss Wren. ‘It’s oh do and oh do. And
why do you?’

“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian.

CHAPTER 19

‘Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoe!’ went the first boy.

Of all men alive, this was one of the last he would have wished to meet
at any time; but, now that he recognised in him only the patron
and protector of Nicholas, he would rather have seen a spectre. One
beneficial effect, however, the encounter had upon him. It instantly
roused all his dormant energies; rekindled in his breast the passions
that, for many years, had found an improving home there; called up all
his wrath, hatred, and malice; restored the sneer to his lip, and the
scowl to his brow; and made him again, in all outward appearance, the
same Ralph Nickleby whom so many had bitter cause to remember.

When he was gone, I rang for Mrs. Crupp, and acquainted her with my
desperate design. Mrs. Crupp said, in the first place, of course it
was well known she couldn't be expected to wait, but she knew a handy
young man, who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it, and whose
terms would be five shillings, and what I pleased. I said, certainly we
would have him. Next, Mrs. Crupp said it was clear she couldn't be in
two places at once (which I felt to be reasonable), and that "a young
gal" stationed in the pantry with a bed-room candle, there never to
desist from washing plates, would be indispensable. I said, what would
be the expense of this young female, and Mrs. Crupp said she supposed
eighteen-pence would neither make me nor break me. I said I supposed
not; and _that_ was settled. Then Mrs. Crupp said, Now about the dinner.

Pray regard me as wholly at the disposal of the theatricals, until they
shall be gloriously achieved.

“Nothing, indeed; and pray don’t take notice of it, it only makes me
worse!”

You marvel that I turn away
From all those flowers so fair and bright,
And gaze at this poor herb, till tears
Arise and dim my sight--
You cannot tell how every leaf
Breathes of a past delight.

‘And how have you been employing yourself in the meanwhile?’ quoth Sir
John, lazily crossing his legs. ‘Where have you been? what harm have you
been doing?’

‘No, sir. He said he wished to see you, sir. Particularly, Mr. Nickleby
said, sir.’

‘I shall see you again to-night?’ said the young man, eagerly.

She knew not what she dreaded, or what hoped; but remained there,
motionless, looking at the porch by which they had disappeared.

Fields, Mrs., 252, 260, 291;
    letter to, 255

Fanny laid her child upon the bed, and putting her face by its side,
shed bitter tears. Sally did not speak, and so both remained till Thomas
came in from his work. Fanny would have hidden the letter from him, but
he saw and seized it in a moment.

“What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?” said Richard,
aside.

He now consigns himself wholly to the guidance of the weird sisters;
and she takes no part in the horrors which desolate Scotland, and rouse
against him the insurrection of the enraged thanes. But she clings
to him faithfully in his downfall. All others except the agents of
his crimes, and his personal dependents, have abandoned him; but she,
with mind diseased, and a heart weighed down by the perilous stuff of
recollections that defy the operation of oblivious antidote, follows
him to the doomed castle of Dunsinane. It is evident that he returns
her affection, by his anxious solicitude about her health, and his
melancholy recital of her mental sufferings. He shows it still more
clearly by his despairing words when the tidings of her death are
announced. Seyton delays to communicate it; but at last the truth must
come,--that the queen is dead. It is the overflowing drop in his cup of
misfortune.

With these words he held out at arm’s length, a dirty, crumpled scrap of
writing. The locksmith took it from him, opened it, and read as follows:

"I've come along rather, I can tell you," replied Lowten. "It went the
half-hour as I came through the Polygon. I'm here before _him_, though,
so I don't mind."

‘Werry well,’ replied that important functionary; adding, in a
confidential manner, ‘I’d adwise the gen’lm’n’s friends to settle. You
see it’s a mere trifle; and, unless the gen’lm’n means to go up afore
the court, it’s hardly worth while waiting for detainers, you know. Our
governor’s wide awake, he is. I’ll never say nothin’ agin him, nor no
man; but he knows what’s o’clock, he does, uncommon.’ Having delivered
this eloquent, and, to Parsons, particularly intelligible harangue, the
meaning of which was eked out by divers nods and winks, the gentleman
in the boots reseated himself in the cab, which went rapidly off, and
was soon out of sight. Mr. Gabriel Parsons continued to pace up and
down the pathway for some minutes, apparently absorbed in deep
meditation. The result of his cogitations seemed to be perfectly
satisfactory to himself, for he ran briskly into the house; said that
business had suddenly summoned him to town; that he had desired the
messenger to inform Mr. Watkins Tottle of the fact; and that they would
return together to dinner. He then hastily equipped himself for a
drive, and mounting his gig, was soon on his way to the establishment
of Mr. Solomon Jacobs, situate (as Mr. Watkins Tottle had informed him)
in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane.

‘I have just eight, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.

‘In substance, all.’

MY DEAREST CATHERINE,

‘Have you, by George!’ said Fledgeby; ‘I suppose you happen to know
whose premises these are?’

‘I am very sorry to put you to any inconvenience, Mrs. Raddle,’ said Bob
Sawyer deferentially, ‘but--’

“As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it
depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
man even now.”

FOOTNOTES:

CHORUS.
    Then fill up a bumper, dear woman's our toast,
    Our comfort in sorrows--in pleasure our boast.

‘He does me no good,’ said Mr Merdle.

But before Reymund plunged afresh into the exterior world, which, for
these weeks, had been shut from his sight, he turned aside for one last
outlook upon pleasure. Thus it happened that he left the train at an
earlier station than the one near Orient’s home, partly to avoid
recognition in the future, partly for the sake of mounting and subduing
a spirited horse which had been brought up to tear himself into a foam
at sight of the engine. Reymund meant to gratify himself that day with a
stroll through Orient’s garden and among the haunts of her bright youth.
No one would have taken him for anything but an apparition, who saw him
galloping down the long country roads in a cloud of dust. When he had
conquered the angry temper of the beast he abated his gait and paced
slowly along the margin of the twice-mown meadows, splendid in noon
sunshine, over the shaven surfaces of rusty reds and browns, into which
they shaded all their gilded verdure. Now and then a bittern cried from
the bank of a tiny thread of the tide, other notes were hushed, there
was only to be heard through the wide midday air the unbroken treble of
the crickets, across which the rich horns of the locusts shrilled like
the elfin trumpets of a summer’s state. Reymund hitched his horse, found
a penetrable portion of the garden paling, and entered.

Here, in a sufficiently dismantled space is the Abattoir of Montmartre,
covering nearly nine acres of ground, surrounded by a high wall, and
looking from the outside like a cavalry barrack.  At the iron gates is a
small functionary in a large cocked hat. ‘Monsieur desires to see the
abattoir?  Most certainly.’  State being inconvenient in private
transactions, and Monsieur being already aware of the cocked hat, the
functionary puts it into a little official bureau which it almost fills,
and accompanies me in the modest attire—as to his head—of ordinary life.

‘I shall not see many more new faces in Trotwood’s stead, Wickfield,’
said the Doctor, warming his hands; ‘I am getting lazy, and want ease.
I shall relinquish all my young people in another six months, and lead a
quieter life.’

‘I see,’ replied Randulph. ‘By Heaven!’ he cried, ‘Mr. Villiers is
coming this way. Two persons stop him. As I live, one of them is his
valet, and the other Captain Culpepper, a fellow whom my uncle Trussell
told me was a sort of bravo, and would cut any man’s throat for hire.
Doubtless they are planning the abduction.

As the father held out his arms for the child, each of the two men looked
steadily at the other.

‘I alone know,’ returned the man, sternly shaking his head, ‘the
mysteries of that crime. I alone know that your trumped-up story cannot
possibly be true. I alone know that it must be altogether false, and
that you must know it to be altogether false. I come here to-night to
tell you so much of what I know, and no more.’

“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick. “By the by; you were
quite a pigeon-fancier.” The man looked up at the sky. “I am told you
had a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friend
of yours to bring me a pair, if you’ve no further use for ’em?”

HANDED IN HIS CHECKS

"My good fellow!" said he, "do you suppose I should be going to Gretna
Green without her?"

‘The T’other Governor hits the nail, Lawyer Lightwood! It was that as
turned me. I had many times and again struggled to relieve myself of the
trouble on my mind, but I couldn’t get it off. I had once very nigh
got it off to Miss Abbey Potterson which keeps the Six Jolly
Fellowships—there is the ’ouse, it won’t run away,—there lives the
lady, she ain’t likely to be struck dead afore you get there—ask
her!—but I couldn’t do it. At last, out comes the new bill with your
own lawful name, Lawyer Lightwood, printed to it, and then I asks the
question of my own intellects, Am I to have this trouble on my mind for
ever? Am I never to throw it off? Am I always to think more of Gaffer
than of my own self? If he’s got a daughter, ain’t I got a daughter?’

‘What now?’ she said with displeasure. ‘What more?’

‘My eyes, how green!’ exclaimed the young gentleman. ‘Why, a
beak’s a madgst’rate; and when you walk by a beak’s order, it’s
not straight for’erd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down
agin. Was you never on the mill?’

Martin and Mr Pinch looked, first at each other, and afterwards at Mr
Tigg, who with his arms folded on his breast surveyed them, half in
despondency and half in bitterness.

‘Go out at once, then,’ said Dennis. ‘What do you want here?’

A pause.

Greatly perplexed, he stopped, looked about him for help, descried none,
and said, bending low: “Where do you live, my child?”

"No."

‘I know, I know!’ returned Newman. ‘They wanted all the happiness to
come together. I’ve been helping ‘em. I--I--look at me, Nick, look at
me!’

‘Never mind, my dear fellow,’ replied Timson, all suavity, shaking
hands with Tottle again most heartily, ‘so long as we see you to
breakfast, you know—’

‘Oh dear me no,’ returned Mrs. Nickleby, glancing at the dial.

‘At this affecting remark, the Gifted shed tears again, and the other two
mingled their tears with his, in a kind—if I may use the expression—of
Mooney and Co.’s entire.  But the old gentleman recovering first,
observed that this was only a reason for hastening the marriage, in order
that Tom’s distinguished race might be transmitted to posterity; and
requesting the Gifted to console Mr. Grig during his temporary absence,
he withdrew to settle the preliminaries with his niece immediately.

Carker listened, with his eyes cast down.

‘Why, Mrs. Rogers, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Bardell, ‘you’ve never been
introduced, I declare! Mr. Raddle, ma’am; Mrs. Cluppins, ma’am; Mrs.
Raddle, ma’am.’

‘Beats the chimbley-pots, Sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat.

It was two or three hours past midnight when I got home. I found my
aunt, in our house, sitting up for me.

‘I am the servant of circumstances, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘and I have
long adapted myself to the governing power of my life.’

Turning from the building in a downcast manner, Mr. Micawber accepted my
proffered arm on one side, and the proffered arm of Traddles on the
other, and walked away between us.

"'Are you able, young man, now to walk?' said a hoarse unpleasing voice
near me; 'your mother, perchance, is uneasy at your absence; and she
should be spared from the bitter knowledge that her only, her beloved
son, intended to have deserted her in her moment of deep affliction.
Hide this from her; it will be a pious secret. Conceal your intention
of self-destruction from her.'

“I don’t know,” said I. “Something to drink?”

"Bless them eyes o' yourn!" said Sam, looking up.

“I assure you we found it so,” says Mr. Guppy. “Would you allow me to
get it filled for you?”

“How is your ward?” asked Jasper, after a time, in a faint, fatigued
voice.

‘MR. BLOTTON (of Aldgate) rose to order. Did the honourable Pickwickian
allude to him? (Cries of “Order,” “Chair,” “Yes,” “No,” “Go on,” “Leave
off,” etc.)

Gashford meekly shrugged his shoulders, and looking on the ground again,
was silent.

As I remember, it was almost midnight when we took our leave. We had had
some biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth had produced from
his pocket a full flask of Hollands, which we men (I may say we men,
now, without a blush) had emptied. We parted merrily; and as they all
stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our
road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em’ly peeping after us, from
behind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we
went.

“Was there any family?” asked Mr Dombey presently.

Kit told him, and the old gentleman wrote down the address with his
pencil.  He had scarcely done so, when there was a great uproar in the
street, and the old lady hurrying to the window cried that Whisker had
run away, upon which Kit darted out to the rescue, and the others
followed.

"Now I understand you, Steerforth!" said I, exultingly. "You pretend to
have bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer a
benefit on him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you. My
dear kind Steerforth, how can I tell you what I think of your
generosity?"

It was remarkable how pale and flurried he had become in an instant.
There was nothing to account for it. His eye had fallen on his razors;
but what of them!

During his engagement with Mr. Bentley, he edited and partly wrote the
“Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi,” {11} a book now almost forgotten, though
not without passages of pathos and humour.  Dickens, in the introductory
chapter (dated February, 1838), gives the following account of his share
in the work:—

He had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this, and he now
turned over on his other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who
had been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible
composure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his
antagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable’s staff
and took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious
custody, of course; but she really did it as if she were an
inexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house.

The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast;
whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately
kissed the matron.

Smith, H. P., letters to, i. 74, 179, 181

"Well, I never see sitch an old ghost in all my born days," exclaimed
Sam, rubbing the old gentleman's back, hard enough to set him on fire
with friction. "What are you a laughin' at, corpilence?"

Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat
down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.

‘And you don’t feel solitary or neglected, going away by yourself; do
you, Pa?’

‘Better there than here,’ said a third voice aloud--Martha’s, though she
did not move. ‘No one knows me there. Everybody knows me here.’

‘And you would have looked at them more curiously yet, if you could
have guessed what I have to tell you,’ said her friend.  ‘One of those
houses is mine.’

The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with
the same air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some
exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily
up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more
attentively. The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence
fearful to hear. But he stood, like a marble figure, without the
motion of a nerve. His haggard face was still thrust forward, his
under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when
the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away. He
gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed.

"A very extraordinary boy, that," said Mr. Pickwick. "Does he always
sleep in this way?"

Although he had never seen either of the Mr Garlands, or Mr Witherden,
since the time of his arrest, he had been given to understand that they
had employed counsel for him.  Therefore, when one of the gentlemen in
wigs got up and said ‘I am for the prisoner, my Lord,’ Kit made him a
bow; and when another gentleman in a wig got up and said ‘And I’m
against him, my Lord,’ Kit trembled very much, and bowed to him too.
And didn’t he hope in his own heart that his gentleman was a match for
the other gentleman, and would make him ashamed of himself in no time!

‘He has been waiting nearly ever since they first came in, and may have
heard your voice--that’s all,’ said Newman, rubbing his hands.

“Quick!” she said, “tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to
go with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute’s loss of
time. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and
be ready as soon as you are.”

The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from
a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being
opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one
side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box,
dismounted too, and stood upon the other side. At a sign from Mr.
Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them,
hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.

The spot was singularly wild and impressive. A wooded amphitheatre,
surrounded on three sides by precipitous cliffs of naked granite,
sloped gently toward the crest of another precipice that overlooked
the valley. It was, undoubtedly, the most suitable spot for a camp,
had camping been advisable. But Mr. Oakhurst knew that scarcely half
the journey to Sandy Bar was accomplished; and the party were not
equipped or provisioned for delay. This fact he pointed out to his
companions curtly, with a philosophic commentary on the folly of
"throwing up their hand before the game was played out." But they were
furnished with liquor, which in this emergency stood them in place of
food, fuel, rest, and prescience. In spite of his remonstrances, it
was not long before they were more or less under its influence. Uncle
Billy passed rapidly from a bellicose state into one of stupor, the
Duchess became maudlin, and Mother Shipton snored. Mr. Oakhurst alone
remained erect, leaning against a rock, calmly surveying them.

Croker, J. Crofton, i. 272;
    letter to, i. 275

Was the heart’s cry of the Ancient Mariner at the recollection of the
blessed moment when the fearful curse of life in death fell off him, and
the heavenly sleep first “slid into his soul.” “Blessings on sleep!”
said honest Sancho Panza: “it wraps one all around like a mantle!”--a
mantle for the weary human frame, lined softly, as with the down of the
eider-duck, and redolent of the soothing odors of the poppy. The fabled
cave of Sleep was in the land of Darkness. No ray of the sun, or moon,
or stars, ever broke upon that night without a dawn. The breath of
somniferous flowers floated in on the still air from the grotto’s
mouth. Black curtains hung round the ever-sleeping god; the Dreams stood
around his couch; Silence kept watch at the portals. Take the winged
Dreams from the picture, and what is left? The sleep of matter.

So it was agreed that his Majesty's lieges in Mudfog should be
astonished with splendour, and slaughtered with envy, and that such a
show should take place as had never been seen in that town, or in any
other town before,--no, not even in London itself.

Sheridan, 86

_Heading to Chapter II_                                         7

Mr Richard not receiving his remarks with anything like enthusiasm, his
employer turned his eyes to his face, and observed that it wore a
troubled expression.

‘I have that assurance from her own lips,’ said Edward, ‘and you know--I
am sure you know--that I would not exchange it for any blessing life
could yield me.’

"Bridget me no Bridgets! do me thine office quickly, Sir Shaveling;
or, by the piper that played before Moses!----" The oath was a fearful
one; and whenever the Baron swore to do mischief, he was never known
to perjure himself. He was playing with the hilt of his sword.--"Do me
thine office, I say. Give him his passport to heaven!"

‘Arthur, my dear boy,’ said Mr Meagles, on the evening of the following
day, ‘Mother and I have been talking this over, and we don’t feel
comfortable in remaining as we are. That elegant connection of
ours--that dear lady who was here yesterday--’

Barnaby was to die. There was no hope. It is not the least evil
attendant upon the frequent exhibition of this last dread punishment,
of Death, that it hardens the minds of those who deal it out, and makes
them, though they be amiable men in other respects, indifferent to, or
unconscious of, their great responsibility. The word had gone forth that
Barnaby was to die. It went forth, every month, for lighter crimes.
It was a thing so common, that very few were startled by the awful
sentence, or cared to question its propriety. Just then, too, when the
law had been so flagrantly outraged, its dignity must be asserted.
The symbol of its dignity,--stamped upon every page of the criminal
statute-book,--was the gallows; and Barnaby was to die.

‘Oh dear!’ she said, rising. ‘Pray don’t let us intrude upon your
domestic happiness! That would be a pity. We have taken tea here, sir,
in your absence; but if you will have the goodness to send us a note of
the expense, receipted, we shall be happy to pay it. Augustus, my love,
we will go, if you please. Mrs Todgers, unless you wish to remain here,
we shall be happy to take you with us. It would be a pity, indeed, to
spoil the bliss which this gentleman always brings with him, especially
into his own home.’

His pipe was now alight.  He drank his beer all at once, and he smoked
and he smiled at me.

‘Yes.’

Here Mr. Bucket, who was sitting in a corner by the door,
good-naturedly offered such consolation as he could administer.

"Where is the magic fish-bone?"

‘No, but hear me,’ said Martin, ‘because this is very important to you,
and a great satisfaction to me. Mark, you shall be a partner in the
business; an equal partner with myself. I will put in, as my additional
capital, my professional knowledge and ability; and half the annual
profits, as long as it is carried on, shall be yours.’

As I am off to Philadelphia this evening, I may as well post my letter
here. I have scarcely a word of news. My cold steadily refuses to leave
me; but otherwise I am as right as one can hope to be under this heavy
work. My New York readings are over (except four farewell nights in
April), and I look forward to the relief of being out of my hardest
hall. Last Friday night, though it was only "Nickleby" and "Boots," I
was again dead beat at the end, and was once more laid upon a sofa. But
the faintness went off after a little while. We have now cold, bright,
frosty weather, without snow--the best weather for me.

The rivalry between the favourites went on increasing; but the Earl
of Somerset's rank and standing still gave him the ascendancy. The
king wished them reconciled; and, for this purpose, desired Villiers
to wait on Somerset with a tender of his duty and attachment. But the
haughty earl, though he had received a hint that the king expected
this offer to be graciously received, spurned at it. "I will none of
your service," was his answer, "and you shall none of my favour. I
will, if I can, break your neck, and of that be confident." It was
immediately after this interview that an inquiry was set on foot into
the circumstances of Overbury's murder; and the supposition of a
contemporary writer is not improbable, that, "had Somerset complied
with Villiers, Overbury's death had still been raked up in his own
ashes."

Uncle, My, a fragment, 175.

‘No, no,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘Why should you be inconvenienced? There’s
another room. There’s another room.’ ‘Oh, but you know,’ returned Uriah,
with a grin, ‘I should really be delighted!’

The watchman said no more, but opened the gate, though rather
doubtfully. Seeing, however, that the visitor went straight and fast in
the right direction, he seemed satisfied.

‘Surely,’ said the blind man, ‘surely. Have you no answer, widow? Is
your mind,’ he slowly added, ‘not made up yet?’

Here Mr. Smallweed, seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his
triumph, breaks off to ejaculate, “Oh, dear me! Oh, Lord! I’m shaken
all to pieces!”

"Now, my uncle was always remarkable for great boldness, and great
presence of mind. All the time that he had appeared so indifferent to
what was going on, he had been looking slyly about, for some missile or
weapon of defence, and at the very instant when the swords were drawn,
he espied, standing in the chimney corner, an old basket-hilted rapier
in a rusty scabbard. At one bound, my uncle caught it in his hand, drew
it, flourished it gallantly above his head, called aloud to the lady
to keep out of the way, hurled the chair at the man in sky-blue, and
the scabbard at the man in plum-colour, and taking advantage of the
confusion, fell upon them both, pell-mell.

The opposite troops, whose falling-in had perplexed Mr. Pickwick a few
seconds before, were drawn up to repel the mimic attack of the sham
besiegers of the citadel; and the consequence was that Mr. Pickwick and
his two companions found themselves suddenly inclosed between two lines
of great length, the one advancing at a rapid pace, and the other
firmly waiting the collision in hostile array.

It was Monks.

John nodded.

‘What! are YOU going to be married, Miss Pecksniff?’ asked Tom in great
surprise.

I was going away, when he directed my attention to the kite.

He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:

‘Don’t say another word. Not another word’ said he. ‘Come along with me.
We mustn’t lose a minute.’

Unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something treacherous in
my communicating what he had told me, to his superiors in the Company,
without first being plain with himself and proposing a middle course to
him, I ultimately resolved to offer to accompany him (otherwise keeping
his secret for the present) to the wisest medical practitioner we could
hear of in those parts, and to take his opinion.  A change in his time of
duty would come round next night, he had apprised me, and he would be off
an hour or two after sunrise, and on again soon after sunset.  I had
appointed to return accordingly.

"Right as a trivet, sir," replied Mr. Weller, with a wink of
intelligence; and having dragged Mr. Pickwick's portmanteau from the
hind boot, into which it had been hastily thrown when they joined the
coach at Eatanswill, Mr. Weller disappeared on his errand. A private
room was speedily engaged; and into it Mr. Pickwick was ushered without
delay.

Mr Pinch nodded his entire assent.

Miss Mercy inquired what his plans for the future might be; in reply to
whom Mr Bailey intimated that he thought of going either into top-boots,
or into the army.

‘Mark!’ said Tom Pinch energetically; ‘if you don’t sit down this
minute, I’ll swear at you!’

‘Do you threaten me, sir?’ cried Mr Pecksniff.

Bathurst, Earl, 12, 33.

“He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,” said Mr.
Brownlow.

Has any such phenomenon as a good and reliable man in this wise ever
come in your way? Forgive my troubling you, and believe me,

“Hush!” cried the man; “it wont answer here. Say another word, and
I’ll do your business myself with a crack on the head that makes no
noise, and is quite as certain and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench the
shutter open. He’s game enough, now, I’ll engage. I’ve seen older hands
of his age took the same way for a minute or two on a cold night.”

“They are very well,” he answered. “Leave them alone, pray. You make so
much of everything.”

“No, I do _not_, Sept,” returned the old lady.

His once more reddening through his brown and being disconcerted by
his efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his
relief.

GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER, KENT,
                                             _Sunday, Oct. 4th, 1868._

‘THE great day has at length arrived.  I have neither eyes, nor ears, nor
pens, nor ink, nor paper, for anything but the wonderful proceedings that
have astounded my senses.  Let me collect my energies and proceed to the
account.

Mr. Micawber was very anxious that I should stay to dinner. I should not
have been averse to do so, but that I imagined I detected trouble, and
calculation relative to the extent of the cold meat, in Mrs. Micawber’s
eye. I therefore pleaded another engagement; and observing that Mrs.
Micawber’s spirits were immediately lightened, I resisted all persuasion
to forego it.

“You shall!”

“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly.

‘At a boarding-school?’ said Sam.

My Child,

‘Yes,’ said Bar. ‘Has not the bird been whispering in very different
ears from ours--in lovely ears?’ He looked expressively at Mrs Merdle’s
nearest ear-ring.

‘He sleeps,’ murmured the spinster aunt. (His organs of vision had been
closed nearly twenty seconds.) ‘Dear--dear--Mr. Tupman!’

"Master Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber, "God bless you! I never can
forget all that, you know, and I never would if I could."

"How much?" asked Miss Betsey.

“But I was going to say, Captain Gills,” said Mr Toots. “Happening to
be this way early this morning—to tell you the truth, I was coming to
breakfast with you. As to sleep, you know, I never sleep now. I might
be a Watchman, except that I don’t get any pay, and he’s got nothing on
his mind.”

‘Quite ri-ght.’

The wind carried away the striking of the great multitude of city
church clocks, for those lay to leeward of them; but there were bells to
windward that told them of its being One—Two—Three. Without that aid
they would have known how the night wore, by the falling of the tide,
recorded in the appearance of an ever-widening black wet strip of shore,
and the emergence of the paved causeway from the river, foot by foot.

In the ear 1747, Foote produced his first piece at the Haymarket, in
which he mimicked the peculiarities of several well-known actors, and,
among others, Macklin. The play was successful; but its performance
having been interdicted by the Westminster magistrates, Foote brought
it out in a new form, under the title of "Diversions of the Morning,"
and issued cards of invitation to the public, requesting the honour of
their company to a tea-party (at playhouse prices) at the Haymarket.
The experiment was a decided hit, and was followed up next season by an
"Auction of Pictures," in which the author lashed with pitiless ridicule
the Virtuoso follies of the day.

“No; in nothing.”

‘I suppose we might,’ returned the other, very quickly. ‘Eh? You really
think so, Gashford?’

"Why, wait patiently, my dear, until he thinks better of it," replied
Mr. Pickwick, cheerfully.

I.
    I ever at college
      From commoners shrank,
    Still craving the knowledge
      Of people of rank:
    In my glass, my lord's ticket
      I eagerly stuffed;
    And all call'd me "Riquet,"
      The man with the Tuft.

"Happily over?"

This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been
days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in
a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.

‘Your Wash-up.’

He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two
before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.

XI       TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A
         SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE

They were dragging themselves along through the last street, and the
child now felt that the time was close at hand when she could bear no
more.  There appeared before them at this moment, going in the same
direction as themselves, a traveller on foot, who, with a bag on his
back, leaned upon a stout stick as he walked and read from a book which
he held in his other hand.

‘They do not,’ replied Rose, colouring deeply.

But nothing is to be attained without striving. In a determined effort
to settle the thoughts, to parcel out the day, to find occupation
regularly or to make it, to be up and doing something, are chiefly to be
found the mere mechanical means which must come to the aid of the best
mental efforts.

The papa was half inclined to cry himself at this unhoped-for
announcement; however, he concealed his consternation as well as he
could. "Nay, sweetheart, is that all?" he exclaimed. "Come, Susan, we
shall have five little angels instead of four. We cannot fail to be
happy!"

“You shall have the paper,” says Mr. Guppy. “He shall bring it down.
But you had better not be seen about here. Sit on our staircase and
read. It’s a quiet place.”

But these were not the worst of Nicholas Tulrumble’s doings.  If they had
been, he might have remained a Mayor to this day, and have talked till he
lost his voice.  He contracted a relish for statistics, and got
philosophical; and the statistics and the philosophy together, led him
into an act which increased his unpopularity and hastened his downfall.

‘Affection,’ said the old man, ‘will expend itself on the living
originals. Do not trouble yourselves, my girls, I shall not so easily
forget you, Charity and Mercy, as to need such tokens of remembrance.
Cousin!’

I said that I should hope to hear, whenever she had an opportunity of
writing.

You need not return his letter, my friend. There is great excitement
here this morning, in consequence of the failure of the Ministry last
night to carry the bill they brought in to please your Emperor and his
troops. _I_, for one, am extremely glad of their defeat.

PREFACE TO THE 1857 EDITION

‘“It is, is it?” said my uncle. “Then here goes! Which coach?”

‘When they’re in a good humour,’ interposed the dirty-faced man.

Nobody came. It was all as silent and dark as ever.

But, alas! the pleasures of paternity were speedily ended. Ballar
detested children. Twins would drive a Malthusian distracted; and what
apology could be offered for thirteen? Nothing remained but to remove
the young Mac Caunthcas in double-quick; and the dwarf, with his usual
good nature, proposed the means. A curragh[32] was procured; the tender
pledges of the maids of honour were placed in a blanket, and fastened
by skewers upon the back of their papa, while the heir to the throne
was accommodated in a separate cloth; and with this precious freight
the curragh was launched upon the ocean.

"No, no, no!" returned the Doctor, in a tone of most pathetic grief.

I might but a few moments previously have imitated Sterne, and said,
‘“And yet, methinks, Eugenius,”—laying my forefinger wistfully on his
coat-sleeve, thus,—“and yet, methinks, Eugenius, ’tis but sorry work to
part with thee, for what fresh fields, . . . my dear Eugenius, . . . can
be fresher than thou art, and in what pastures new shall I find Eliza, or
call her, Eugenius, if thou wilt, Annie?”’—I say I might have done this;
but Eugenius was gone, and I hadn’t done it.

‘My dear sir,’ cried Mr Pecksniff, bending over him, ‘you must not give
way to this. It is very natural, and very amiable, but you must not
allow the shameless conduct of one whom you long ago cast off, to move
you so far. Rouse yourself. Think,’ said Pecksniff, ‘think of Me, my
friend.’

"I am sorry to disturb you--but a word directly."

Mr. Winkle, being half asleep, obeyed the command mechanically, opened
the door a little, and peeped out. The first thing he saw, was the
red glare of the link-boy's torch. Startled by the sudden fear that
the house might be on fire, he hastily threw the door wide open, and
holding the candle above his head, stared eagerly before him, not quite
certain whether what he saw was a sedan-chair or a fire-engine. At this
instant there came a violent gust of wind; the light was blown out; Mr.
Winkle felt himself irresistibly impelled on to the steps; and the door
blew to, with a loud crash.

"A golden one."

“My dear Sir,” she said, addressing Mr Dombey, at whose munificence
both she and Mrs Chick were shedding tears copiously; “I think you have
overlooked something. Pardon me, Mr Dombey, I think, in the nobility of
your character, and its exalted scope, you have omitted a matter of
detail.”

“Then suffer old Joe to present a friend, Ma’am,” said the Major,
promptly, “as a reason for being tolerated. Mr Dombey, Mrs Skewton.”
The lady in the chair was gracious. “Mr Dombey, Mrs Granger.” The lady
with the parasol was faintly conscious of Mr Dombey’s taking off his
hat, and bowing low. “I am delighted, Sir,” said the Major, “to have
this opportunity.”

And that here I am.

To which Mr. Lamps returned the curious reply: “Bedside.”

"Well, but, G----, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at
last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the
Minister?"

CHAPTER XVI.
RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY

‘Indeed, you have reason to commend her!’ I returned. ‘You are a happy
fellow. I believe you make yourselves, and each other, two of the
happiest people in the world.’

These sentiments, and their open avowal, although they may not cause the
settler to tremble for the safety of his homestead, ought nevertheless
to make the statesman ponder well on the condition and aspirations of
this ill-used race. The editor continues:

After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the
amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that
would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr.
Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn’t get any more he
must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put
the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then, taking leave of his
affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and
the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and
composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady’s
return.

With such conversation, possessing the inestimable charm of blending
amusement with instruction, did Mr. Weller beguile the tediousness of
the journey, during the greater part of the day. Topics of conversation
were never wanting, for even when any pause occurred in Mr. Weller’s
loquacity, it was abundantly supplied by the desire evinced by Mr.
Magnus to make himself acquainted with the whole of the personal history
of his fellow-travellers, and his loudly-expressed anxiety at every
stage, respecting the safety and well-being of the two bags, the leather
hat-box, and the brown-paper parcel.

"You are reading for the bar, Mr. Waterbrook informed me?" said I.

Somebody incautiously asked, what from? But there was a scandalized
whisper of ‘Hush!’

However, I now wrote a comforting letter to Mrs. Micawber, in our joint
names, and we both signed it. As we walked into town to post it,
Traddles and I held a long conference, and launched into a number of
speculations, which I need not repeat. We took my aunt into our counsels
in the afternoon; but our only decided conclusion was, that we would be
very punctual in keeping Mr. Micawber's appointment.

CHAPTER XXX-ENGLAND UNDER MARY

Here Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently, which appeared to afford Mr.
Grimwig the most exquisite delight.

"No," he replied hastily, "I have not, but I will directly I come off."
So saying, he danced upon the stage, followed by Grimaldi, and the
usual buffeting ensued with the accustomed effect. The pantomime was
over a few minutes afterwards, and Grimaldi, who felt very tired when
he had gone through his part, in consequence of his recent illness,
went straight home, and was in bed a very short time after the curtain
fell.

“That’s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his
chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.

BARNABY RUDGE

Mr Dombey put his hand to his neckcloth, settled his chin in it,
coughed, and stood looking at his faithful friend and servant for a few
moments in silence.

The day arrived.  A raging winter day, that shook the old house,
sometimes, as if it shivered in the blast.  A day to make home doubly
home.  To give the chimney-corner new delights.  To shed a ruddier glow
upon the faces gathered round the hearth, and draw each fireside group
into a closer and more social league, against the roaring elements
without.  Such a wild winter day as best prepares the way for shut-out
night; for curtained rooms, and cheerful looks; for music, laughter,
dancing, light, and jovial entertainment!

“We have not so much dust as that in London,” replied the Jew, pointing
from Noah’s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two
bundles.

Mrs. Nickleby wasted no words, but uttered an exclamation of horror and
surprise, and immediately fainted away.

The gentleman, not otherwise hard-hearted or indifferent to such scenes,
than that he saw them every day, and knew that they were figures of no
moment in the Filer sums—mere scratches in the working of these
calculations—laid his hand upon the heart that beat no more, and listened
for the breath, and said, ‘His pain is over.  It’s better as it is!’
Mrs. Tugby tried to comfort her with kindness.  Mr. Tugby tried
philosophy.

The contraband beast, however, assuring all present, with his
significant finger, that he peremptorily declined to leave his post at
the door, Signor Panco offered his services. He soon returned with the
bottle of wine: which, according to the custom of the place, originating
in a scarcity of corkscrews among the Collegians (in common with a
scarcity of much else), was already opened for use.

“My dear!”

It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting
in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,
addressed him as her "Dear, dear brother."

CHAPTER 22 -- Nicholas, accompanied by Smike, sallies forth to seek his Fortune. He encounters Mr. Vincent Crummles; and who he was, is herein made manifest

‘Pardon me,’ said I, ‘you are a well-favoured, well-made man, and
yet—forgive me—I find, on examining my mind, that I associate you
with—that my recollection indistinctly makes you, in short—excuse me—a
kind of powerful monster.’

Ever affectionately, dear Georgy.

"A peaceful place to live in, don't you think so?" said her friend.

She put her hands tightly over her ears, confusedly tumbling down her
bright black hair in the vehemence of the action, and turned her face
resolutely to the wall. Miss Wade, who had watched her under this final
appeal with that strange attentive smile, and that repressing hand
upon her own bosom with which she had watched her in her struggle at
Marseilles, then put her arm about her waist as if she took possession
of her for evermore.

“Oh! you mustn’t be too hard upon them, sir,” said Mrs. Mann,
coaxingly.

"You don't mean that?" said Sam.

IV.

‘No, but Barbara,’ said Kit, detaining her gently, ‘let us part
friends.  I was always thinking of you, in my troubles.  I should have
been a great deal more miserable than I was, if it hadn’t been for you.’

"Did you ever go to law?" asked Mr. Snitchey, looking out of the blue
bag.

NEW YORK
  E. P. DUTTON & COMPANY
  31 West Twenty-Third Street

‘Three passengers,’ returned the guard.

‘I can’t hear what you say--don’t talk to me--it isn’t safe--go away--go
away!’ returned Gride.

"Not the least."

This latter epistle never reached its destination,--my poor fellow broke
his neck at Epping; and, as the letter was despatched in too great haste
to be fully directed, it was opened and returned to me by the coroner in
due course of post.

"'Cause I was always used to a four-poster afore I came here, and I
find the legs of the table answer just as well," replied the cobbler.

Mrs Pipchin rubbed her hands, and bent her grey eyes on the fire.

‘Nothing particular, sir,’ replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the
eyes.

"Ye--ye--yes, my lord."

“Live like a gentleman—board and lodging, pipes and spirits free—half
of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,” replied Mr.
Fagin.

‘Not snug enough to prevent your finding us, it seems,’ Hugh answered,
sulkily.

“How do you know he wasn’t here?”

‘Strange?’ echoed the doctor. ‘Blathers and Duff, themselves, could
make nothing of it.’

[Illustration: _"Weeks!" said Mr. Pickwick in astonishment--and out
came the note-book again_]

How, or at what hour, Mr. Watkins Tottle returned to Cecil-street is
unknown. His boots were seen outside his bedroom-door next morning; but
we have the authority of his landlady for stating that he neither
emerged therefrom nor accepted sustenance for four-and-twenty hours. At
the expiration of that period, and when a council of war was being held
in the kitchen on the propriety of summoning the parochial beadle to
break his door open, he rang his bell, and demanded a cup of
milk-and-water. The next morning he went through the formalities of
eating and drinking as usual, but a week afterwards he was seized with
a relapse, while perusing the list of marriages in a morning paper,
from which he never perfectly recovered.

That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good
people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm
with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for
many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and
ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now
that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the
black stick and hat-band, while he, the old one, remained stationary in
the muffin-cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah
did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry
was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and
a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as
comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in
the grain department of a brewery.

‘You knew I would. You knew _me_,’ she interrupted.

Do look at the enclosed from Mrs. What's-her-name. For a surprising
audacity it is remarkable even to me, who am positively bullied, and all
but beaten, by these people. I wish you would do me the favour to write
to her (in your own name and from your own address), stating that you
answered her letter as you did, because if I were the wealthiest
nobleman in England I could not keep pace with one-twentieth part of the
demands upon me, and because you saw no internal evidence in her
application to induce you to single it out for any especial notice.
That the tone of this letter renders you exceedingly glad you did so;
and that you decline, from me, holding any correspondence with her.
Something to that effect, after what flourish your nature will.

“And whose fault was that?”

Why, I am not naturally positive. Every one knows that I wouldn't set my
own opinion against the opinion of Mrs. Peerybingle, unless I were quite
sure, on any account whatever. Nothing should induce me. But, this is a
question of fact. And the fact is, that the kettle began it at least
five minutes before the Cricket gave any sign of being in existence.
Contradict me, and I'll say ten.

‘How do you do, Mr. Weller?’

No such attractive issue has been made of the writings of Mr. Dickens,
which, various as have been the forms of publication adapted to the
demands of an ever widely-increasing popularity, have never yet been
worthily presented in a really handsome library form.

He put his black cap on again as he had taken it off, and resumed his
own seat. There was a wonderful air of benignity and patronage in his
manner. These were the ceremonies with which he received the collegians.

‘Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir,’ said the little man, untying the bundle, and
glancing eagerly at Mr. Pickwick out of the corners of his eyes. ‘It
must be mentioned. I have come here on purpose. Now, are you ready to
hear what I have to say, my dear Sir? No hurry; if you are not, I can
wait. I have this morning’s paper here. Your time shall be mine. There!’
Hereupon, the little man threw one leg over the other, and made a show
of beginning to read with great composure and application.

The Island was occupied by a very small English colony.  It had been
given the name of Silver-Store.  The reason of its being so called, was,
that the English colony owned and worked a silver-mine over on the
mainland, in Honduras, and used this Island as a safe and convenient
place to store their silver in, until it was annually fetched away by the
sloop.  It was brought down from the mine to the coast on the backs of
mules, attended by friendly Indians and guarded by white men; from thence
it was conveyed over to Silver-Store, when the weather was fair, in the
canoes of that country; from Silver-Store, it was carried to Jamaica by
the armed sloop once a-year, as I have already mentioned; from Jamaica,
it went, of course, all over the world.

‘Now you prodigal old son,’ said Jenny, shaking her head and her
emphatic little forefinger at her burden, ‘you sit there till I come
back. You dare to move out of your corner for a single instant while I’m
gone, and I’ll know the reason why.’

In the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand side of the way, a
short distance after you have passed through the open space fronting
the Town Hall, stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation
of the Great White Horse, rendered the more conspicuous by a stone
statue of some rampacious animal with flowing mane and tail, distantly
resembling an insane cart-horse, which is elevated above the principal
door. The Great White Horse is famous in the neighbourhood, in the same
degree as a prize ox, or county-paper-chronicled turnip, or unwieldy
pig--for its enormous size. Never were such labyrinths of uncarpeted
passages, such clusters of mouldy, ill-lighted rooms, such huge numbers
of small dens for eating or sleeping in, beneath any one roof, as are
collected together between the four walls of the Great White Horse at
Ipswich.

LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS

MY DEAR BROOKFIELD,

Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker’s some three weeks or a
month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking
their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after
several deferential glances at his wife, said,

“I don’t know that I need trouble you,” returned Carker, turning over
the papers in his hand. “You have a committee today at three, you
know.”

‘Nothing, Sir,’ said Mr. Snodgrass, who began to feel rather
uncomfortable himself.

There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-school.
Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had of course
agreed with them. Nothing, however, was concluded on the subject yet.
In the meantime, I learnt lessons at home. Shall I ever forget those
lessons! They were presided over nominally by my mother, but really by
Mr. Murdstone and his sister, who were always present, and found them
a favourable occasion for giving my mother lessons in that miscalled
firmness, which was the bane of both our lives. I believe I was kept
at home for that purpose. I had been apt enough to learn, and willing
enough, when my mother and I had lived alone together. I can faintly
remember learning the alphabet at her knee. To this day, when I look
upon the fat black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty of their
shapes, and the easy good-nature of O and Q and S, seem to present
themselves again before me as they used to do. But they recall no
feeling of disgust or reluctance. On the contrary, I seem to have walked
along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book, and to have been
cheered by the gentleness of my mother’s voice and manner all the
way. But these solemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember as the
death-blow of my peace, and a grievous daily drudgery and misery. They
were very long, very numerous, very hard--perfectly unintelligible,
some of them, to me--and I was generally as much bewildered by them as I
believe my poor mother was herself.

"Sweet-Heart! my own Sweet-Heart!" she whispered.

‘Like most other men, I suppose,’ returned Mr Garland, smiling.  ‘I can
be, if I am interested; and if not interested, I should still try to
appear so.  Why do you ask?’

The "Maid of Bath" was followed by the "Nabob" and the "Bankrupt," the
first of which was an effective attack on the habits of many of those
old curmudgeons who, about the middle of the last century--the period
of Anglo-Indian prosperity--returned with dried livers from the East,
rich as Chartres, and equally profligate; and the last, on the crazy
commercial speculations of the day. The sketch of Sir Robert Riscounter
in the "Bankrupt" is supposed to have been meant for the well-known Sir
George Fordyce, who failed, in the year 1772, for an almost unparalleled
amount. Of these two plays, the "Nabob" is the most carefully finished;
but its breadth and grossness must ever prevent its revival.

_The Chimes._

‘It need be sharp to suit your wits, sir,’ said Miss Abbey. ‘What have
you got in hand now?’

‘And as concerning the nests and the drawers,’ said Sloppy, after
measuring the handle on his sleeve, and softly standing the stick aside
against the wall, ‘why, it would be a real pleasure to me. I’ve heerd
tell that you can sing most beautiful; and I should be better paid with
a song than with any money, for I always loved the likes of that, and
often giv’ Mrs Higden and Johnny a comic song myself, with “Spoken” in
it. Though that’s not your sort, I’ll wager.’

Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed
within wide London’s bounds since night hung over it, that was the
worst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning
air, that was the foulest and most cruel.

The journey seemed endless; street after street was entered and left
behind; and still they went jolting on. At last Mr. Squeers began to
thrust his head out of the widow every half-minute, and to bawl a
variety of directions to the coachman; and after passing, with some
difficulty, through several mean streets which the appearance of the
houses and the bad state of the road denoted to have been recently
built, Mr. Squeers suddenly tugged at the check string with all his
might, and cried, ‘Stop!’

‘Might I be permitted to inscribe your name upon the tablets of my
memory?’ I asked.

But, with Captain Boldheart, to throw off his uniform coat regardless of
the various rich orders with which it was decorated, and to plunge into
the sea after the drowning giant, was the work of a moment. Maddening
was the excitement when boats were lowered; intense the joy when the
captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth; deafening
the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of the Beauty. And
from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones, Captain
Boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as William Boozey.

"Did the knowledge that it was to be its wives, then, wring its hearts
almost to breaking; and did its fathers deceive it from its cradles but
to break its hearts at last!"

BOB. Beautiful! There never was such a goose. It's tender as a lamb, and
cheap as dirt. The apple sauce and mashed potatoes are delicious--and
now, love, for the pudding. The thought of it makes you nervous.

"Once awakened from my dream--I have been a poor dreamer, in one way or
other, all my life--I see how natural it is that she should have some
regretful feeling towards her old companion and her equal. That she does
regard him with some innocent regret, with some blameless thoughts of
what might have been, but for me, is, I fear, too true. Much that I have
seen, but not noted, has come back upon me with new meaning, during this
last trying hour. But, beyond this, gentlemen, the dear lady's name
never must be coupled with a word, a breath, of doubt."

Never never never shall I forget the fair bright face of our boy when he
stood at the foot of the bed, looking at his unknown father.  And O so
like his dear young mother then!

JUNCTION HOUSE, BRIGHTON, _March 2nd, 1848._

‘As soon as I do. I should hope, to-morrow. They are coming to say that
our time for talk is over. I hear the jingling of the keys. Not another
word of this just now, or they may overhear us.’

She put aside her work, as she was used to do when we were seriously
discussing anything; and gave me her whole attention.

“Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
“if you are ready, I am.”

"Drive! I don't want no driving," returned Mr. Peggotty with an honest
laugh. "I only go too ready."

There was a sailor who had been there upwards of eleven years, and who in
a few months’ time would be free.  Eleven years of solitary confinement!

With a consciously bad grace and stiff manner, as Wrayburn looked so
easily and calmly on, he went out with these words, and the heavy door
closed like a furnace-door upon his red and white heats of rage.

‘Clennam and Co. a--hum--a mother!’ exclaimed Mr Dorrit.

‘Who was with you?’

‘Now,’ he said, ‘gather them up; and when this cursed peal of
thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is
gone, let’s hear your story.’

"A strange place to worship God in."

They were on the top of the house--a great point with my aunt, being
near the fire-escape--and consisted of a little half-blind entry where
you could see hardly anything, a little stone-blind pantry where you
could see nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a bedroom. The furniture
was rather faded, but quite good enough for me; and, sure enough, the
river was outside the windows.

CHAPTER 25 -- Concerning a young Lady from London, who joins the Company, and an elderly Admirer who follows in her Train; with an affecting Ceremony consequent on their Arrival

P.S. If you should go near Barnard Castle, there is good ale at the
King’s Head. Say you know me, and I am sure they will not charge you
for it. You may say Mr. Noggs there, for I was a gentleman then. I was
indeed.

[Footnote 3: The Peris of Persian romance are supposed to feed upon the
choicest odours; by which food they overcome their bitterest enemies
the Deevs, (with whom they wage incessant war,) whose malignant nature
is impatient of fragrance.]

"Eccentricities of genius, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick. "You may retire."

John Owen having been thus rebuked, and being in perfect possession of
the speech aside, the bachelor singled out another boy.

“If I have not gone to foreign countries, young man, foreign countries
have come to me. They have come to me in the way of business, and I
have improved upon my opportunities. Put it that I take an inventory,
or make a catalogue. I see a French clock. I never saw him before, in
my life, but I instantly lay my finger on him and say ‘Paris!’ I see
some cups and saucers of Chinese make, equally strangers to me
personally: I put my finger on them, then and there, and I say ‘Pekin,
Nankin, and Canton.’ It is the same with Japan, with Egypt, and with
bamboo and sandalwood from the East Indies; I put my finger on them
all. I have put my finger on the North Pole before now, and said ‘Spear
of Esquimaux make, for half a pint of pale sherry!’”

Mr. Pickwick nodded assent, and coughed to attract the attention of the
young gentlemen behind the partition, who, having now relaxed their
minds by a little conversation among themselves, condescended to take
some notice of the stranger.

Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that
roof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to
himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once during
dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,
but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often
looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his
face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a
dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often
referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,
he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he
extorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those references
out of my innocent self.

‘Yes,’ replied Mr Tappertit haughtily, descending as he spoke, ‘who
should it be?’

“Yes; the man whom Mary let in; whom she went up-stairs to the nursery to
tell you about; whom you came down to speak to; the same chap, I make no
doubt, whom you took into the nursery to have your talk out with; whom
Ailsie saw, and afterwards dreamed about; thinking, poor wench! she saw
him say his prayers, when nothing, I’ll be bound, was farther from his
thoughts; who took Mrs. Chadwick’s brooch, value ten pounds.  Now, Norah!
Don’t go off!  I am as sure as that my name’s Thomas Openshaw, that you
knew nothing of this robbery.  But I do think you’ve been imposed on, and
that’s the truth.  Some good-for-nothing chap has been making up to you,
and you’ve been just like all other women, and have turned a soft place
in your heart to him; and he came last night a-lovyering, and you had him
up in the nursery, and he made use of his opportunities, and made off
with a few things on his way down!  Come, now, Norah: it’s no blame to
you, only you must not be such a fool again.  Tell us,” he continued,
“what name he gave you, Norah?  I’ll be bound it was not the right one;
but it will be a clue for the police.”

Well, now that you are inside it, what do you think of it? Is the
wine-market of Paris like any thing else? The name of the establishment
puts the London Docks into your head; but, beyond their commercial use
and distinction, there is no more analogy between the London Docks, and
this little bit of fairy-land, than there was between the caverns of
Ætna, where Vulcan made pokers and tongs, and the slopes of Parnassus
where the Muses danced. The Halle-aux-Vins is not a building, nor a
labyrinthine cellar; it is a complete town, as perfect and unique
in its way as Pompeii itself. Once a week, indeed, it resembles the
city of the dead; it is silent, solitary, and closed. No business is
transacted there on Sundays, save only by the restless spirits which
will work unseen, and which contrive to make their escape invisibly,
however fast they may be imprisoned.

“My dear Lucretia,” returned Mrs Chick, “what mystery is involved in
this remarkable request? I must insist upon knowing.”

"It was a gleam of light upon me, Trot," said my aunt, drying her eyes,
"when I formed the resolution of being godmother to your sister Betsey
Trotwood, who disappointed me; but, next to that, hardly anything would
have given me greater pleasure, than to be godmother to that good young
creature's baby!"
