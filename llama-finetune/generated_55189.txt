The coach we were in had a neat hole through its front - a reminiscence of its last trip through this region. The bullet that made it wounded the driver slightly, but he did not mind it much.

Then I came upon an iron hook hanging from one side of the axle; and onthe other side of it hung another hook; and each time that my horse rodeby those hooks he would jump into the air as if by some miraculous power,as if his legs would fly off his body, and then come flying back again,so fast that I was afraid to go near him. He did it at every turn--themiraculous jumps went by so fast that they seemed like tricks done witha rubber leg. Then, when I would try to put my foot on the brake, myhorse would begin to spring at me and leave me no room to stop, though hewasn't moving any faster than when he got out of it. One day, as Istood with my hand on the brake, to prevent my horse from running awayfrom me, my leg caught hold of something projecting from under the seat,and I found myself sitting down there, all alone and frightened, for myhorse was gone! But presently I saw him coming along just around thecorner, with his fore-feet above the ground, and before I could get uphimself I had driven up alongside him. So I stopped right in the middleof the road, holding him tight, and let him run.The journey took us about six days and two nights. We stayed three orfour hours in the evening at a place called "Gibraltar," because oursteamboat had taken her engines out of commission a week ago, and themud on top of them looked exactly like Gibraltar. This place isabout fifty miles distant from San Francisco, and lies on the coastwith very pleasant scenery, including a grand view of the Gulf ofCalifornia, which looks as smooth as glass, and has a fine deep blue tintto it. Some of these boats are painted red instead of black, but theirreputation does not exceed that of the steamer "Wesleyan," as she iscalled. She was built here, fifteen years ago, and has been constantlybought-up ever since; now she is nearly half finished, but still lacksone hundred feet of her upper deck, and will cost $200,000 more to makeup. I heard this afternoon that she is to be sold. She has twenty-fivehundred tons capacity, and makes four thousand dollars' return yearly.She was named after Wesleyan University, New York, but nobody knows howthat connection arose. It has long ago become popularly known that theboats are owned by the Wesleyan churches of New England, but I don't seehow this can be true, unless it is in the case of the "Wesleyan" only. Youhave a church named Methodist Episcopal Church, United States, in Boston,but you don't have a church named Wesleyan, Methodist Episcopal Church,U.S., in New Orleans, where the boat stands. As far as I know, bothcourses are in full use. I believe the Wesleyans take ship twice as oftenas the Methodists. They seem to prefer sailing northward, however, whilethe Methodists seem to like going southward more. The weather seems tounfavor the southern course, but I am not acquainted with the facts of thematter sufficiently to determine whether this is so or not. I do not findtherefore that the Wesleyans are really a small community, nor do I seewhere the Methodists form such a majority. There were 5,000 persons inthis town yesterday, but I think most of them were servants. All thechurches are closed today. The ladies have been putting on mourning forthe deceased, the ministers are burying themselves for the lost ones,the children are mourning, and the young men are cutting off a little bitof hair each. In the morning it will be a strange sight, for everybodywill have grown whiskers, or else the hair will be standing erect. Ithas been rather dark business lately among the Methodists, and theirfellow-members among the Baptists have also had their share. Their leadersare always quarrelsome, and they seem never to succeed in reconcilingthem without killing somebody. It may interest you to know that Mrs.Simpson, the principal widow of New Orleans, died last night, and thather husband's funeral will take place to-day, at twelve o'clock noon,in the same church in which he officiated a few years ago, when hedied himself. And it must be remembered that Dr. Simpson was an oldfriend of mine, and lived on his estate. If anybody should inquire of mewhat became of the doctor after his death, I should answer that he wasbrought home by the police--not buried.He was a man who could speak several languages fluently, and would standany language for study. He was quite intelligent, and good-looking,both on account of his person and his conversation. His memory was so goodand accurate that it would remind him of things that never occurred toothers. He was fond of flowers, and his flower-rooms in his house werebeautiful. When he was ill, he usually walked about all night with hishandkerchief to his nose, until the next morning when he returned tohis bed. He would sleep like the dead afterward, and slept peacefullyon the floor during storms.He used to make people believe that the earthquake and fire was onlya trick, and that the poor widows and orphans would all be rescued fromthe ruins, and live happily ever after. He was a man whose memory wastremendously defective. It is said that he thought he was a dog, andhe was very fond of dogs. He always had a favorite pet. One of thesebeings was a monkey, whom he kept in a cage in the midst of his drawing-residence. Another pet was a boa-constrictor, who lived under the sofa.He had nine wives, and twelve husbands, and eleven brothers, and tenbrothers-in-law, altogether. One day he invited me to dinner in hishouse, and when we arrived he began to tell me a whole story about thetroubles of the last generation. I didn't wait till he had gotten to thepart about the fire and earthquake, but I asked him what the worst troublewas. He told me about two kinds of troubles, and added that he consideredthat the first was better, and therefore it was the worst.which surprised me, because I thought that I knew just as well as hedoctored me concerning the second, as to which I supposed thatthe fire and the earthquake was the worst. It was very interesting tome, nevertheless, because I believed that I did not understand even partof the matter, and yet I was so curious to know what it was that I hadbetter luck than others. I was getting along tolerably well with it,then, when a stranger appeared, who was new to town, and wished to hearall that had happened in the past year. He had not been able to get aplace on the Sunday paper, and he felt that he would never find a placeupon any thing else. Therefore, he decided to listen to a lecture onit. I went with him, and at length we settled down in the drawing-roomat the end of the lecture. When he left, I spoke to him about theunusual heat in New Orleans, saying that we had experienced a summermuch hotter than ever. He said: "It rained all summer."I said: "Yes.""Well, then, why did it rain?""I don't know.""It is a wonder that it doesn't rain in the winter, too.""'Tis the hottest time of the year. Why shouldn't it rain in the summer?But it hasn't. I don't know what it is about.""No?""Nothing. What it is about, I can't say. It is as bad as any other timeof the year except Christmas. The thermometer has been at ninety degreesfor weeks together, and this has been the hottest season of the year.""Hasn't it?""No. It isn't hot enough.""What do you mean by that?""Mean by it, nothing.""But you are bound to admit, as your senses testify, that it is not coldto feel hot.""Why, I haven't felt it that way yet.""Where did you get that idea?""You couldn't give it me.""If you knew anything at all, you wouldn't ask me such questions. Yourquestion puzzles me. Do you want me to say that the thermometer doesscream and shout all the time?""Did I say anything about screams and shouts? Yes, yes, I did. Why didyou interrupt me?""Because you interrupted me. Now, look here. I've tried to explain toyou everything about the heat in New Orleans. Now, do you want to knowanything more, or is it enough?""And is that all you want to ask me?" "No; I want to know what is the cause of this awful heat in NewCleveland, and what is the reason why New Orleans is so much worse thanN Cleveland.""I'll tell you, but I won't tell you why New Orleans is colder than NewNewark.""Tell me _why_ it is colder.""Because it is warmer here than you are.""How d'ye come by that fact?""You haven't noticed it, probably.""Have you?""No. I have lived in the neighborhood all my life, and I never oncethought it worth noticing.""Oh. Well, I guess I don't know what to say. You've puzzled me, anyway.""Your imagination plays tricks on you, sir; but you mustn't blame it uponmy temperament. I am perfectly happy and satisfied with my temperaments,they are perfect, none of them is wanting in perfection, and none of them isfaulty; and if you could lay your hands on the exact temperaments of acertain species of animal, you might discover in them nothing wrong withthem, save perhaps that they sometimes wander to one extreme or theother, according to circumstances."Let me show you something which happens occasionally.""Now, look here!""I'm going to call attention to a circumstance which has happened to memany times, in many places, but particularly in St. Louis, Missouri, inthe month of June. On Saturday night of last summer, when I was walkingthrough a busy street, I fell into the path of an automobile, and waspresented with a choice of wounds. I picked the lightest one. I said tothat automobile driver, 'Good-morning.' He said to me, 'Good-morning, Mr.----.'"Mr.--I never liked Mr. O--, either for a name or for company."Then you had me pick a worse one. What was the difference between the twothings?""Well, there were a dozen different differences. To tell you the truth, Ididn't notice the difference--I was thinking of other things.""Why? Was there anything peculiar about this Mr. O--, besides beinglittle?""Yes, there was. He wore a kind of short-sleeved suit, and white gloves.His complexion was pale, but pleasant. And he was wearing spectacles."Was he bald?""N-no, I don't remember."
"He must have been bald, because if he hadn't worn glasses he would havekept trying to adjust his spectacles on his forehead all the time. Inthat short-sleeved suit he certainly looked the picture of indifference.If he had come to talk to me, I would have said, 'How do you do, Mr.O-O?', and waited for an answer, but he never answered my questions, buthe looked at me steadily, and I began to lose patience. Then I said,"Look! I can see you looking at me.""Which is a mistake.""Then I suppose it is my fault for coming along without any speculares."Neither of us was dressed for travelling, and neither of us was in asharply ventilated carriage. That was all the difference between us, and Iconsidered it a great deal the best of injuries."Did he strike you?""Me? No.""But he struck a number of gentlemen and women in that street--at leasteighteen or nineteen of them.""That is odd. Where'd you get that information?""From witnesses; and they gave me evidence of it.""Will the witnesses produce their cards?""Most assuredly. Shall I swear you to a perjury?""Please yourself.""I will. Who shall bear witness against you?""Myself.""Sir, you are sworn.""Witnesses, please--a couple of witnesses--and witnesses for the defense. A jury would be wise to go and seeit all for themselves. Come, sit down and give your testimony. I will helpyourself."CHAPTER VI.CHAPTER XVI."Why, now, I declare that I do feel pretty comfortable.""Pretty comfortable--oh, certainly, indeed you do, sir. Will you open your lips a little?I can hardly bear your silence.""Sorry. I keep quiet because it gives me a chance to make a mistake.""There, there!--you've done it this time. Don't you mind it any?""No--it don't seem to bother me.""D-d-do you really--do you mean to stay silent all the rest of the time?""Sure. I'm perfectly comfortable, sir.""Come, Mr. Webster--don't be bashful. Come forward."'What makes you so uncomfortable?''Well, sir, sir, I simply cannot say. I have been through this long waylast night, and I can't take my thoughts into my head and my tongue outof my mouth without breaking my neck; and if I am mistaken about thereason why I feel uncomfortable, well, I hope you will forgive my havingprotested so freely over my discomfort, considering what I am about to say,well enough to allow the public to entertain the belief that the public ought togive me fair play, and not kick me out of their presence so cheaply as I amtaken.""Then it is just as well you did it, Mr. Webster. It saves me a good deal ofwork. What are your reasons?""Reasons? Well, sir, I wish to state them briefly, first, to make the courtno longer occupied, and secondly, to enable me to prove them by my owndepositions.""Very well; now, sir, I will read your names. Here is the name of Mr. Dobbins.This is the name of Mr. Dobbins's wife. This is the name of Mr.Dobbins's brother, John H. Dobbins. This is the name of Dr. Dobbins.this is the name of Mr. Dobbins' secretary. This is the name of Mr.Dobbins' clerk. This is the name of Mr. Dobbins' son. Now, sir, you see that Iwrote down the names of twelve people. I have already stated five of them,now--that is to say, I am about to make statements of my impressions, and Iwill proceed to make them, leaving out of consideration the names of thefive first mentioned. They are not necessary to mention, you see.""Thank you. Thank you very much. I thank you heartily. How would you wish tobegin?""By naming the first of those five first, and then following with a briefstatement of your impressions upon the subject.""'First,' sir?""Of course. What I meant to say is, first name the particular person that youcame across. Then, sir, follow up with a statement of your impression. Doyou see that?""Indeed, sir, I do. Oh, indeed I do. I do see that. Indeed I do.""Ahem! Very good--very good, indeed, sir. Are you willing to undertake that job?""Excellent! Excellent, sir, truly excellent.""All right. I will name Mr. Dobbins first, and follow it with a briefstatement of my impressions upon the subject.""Go ahead, sir.""Sir, I have no hesitation in giving Mr. Dobbins the preference over anyothers on the list I prepared. He is the only one in the list who wasexcepted from travel. Also, sir, he is the only one on the list whom I knowall about. All the other seven are strangers to me, as regards name anddisposition. It is highly satisfactory, sir, that I find that I have so fewthings to choose from among the inhabitants of Louisiana, and that I amcanvassed so completely, that I need find no excuse for my absence fromhere. And although I have travelled so far and seen so much of New Orleans,I owe my life to the fact that there are many, many things which I haveyet to see and experience, and I hope, sir, that the public will send meagain. I don't care for money, sir, but I do love to see a city as itif it were alive, sir, as it is dead; and I have had a good deal of that.And, sir, I am sorry for my dear departed parents, for they deserve bettercare than they received--more than I rendered--even though they died poor. For itwas their wealth that made them rich, but their poverty that gave themworldly comfort, whereas yours--their poverty produced misery and suffering. It is noteverybody's lot, sir, to die, as it is with us. With me, sir, it was toseveral terms a blessing to lie in that soft grass and watch birds sing--andthe sun shine, and the flowers bloom, and the sea breathe its salt air.My father and mother never knew what happiness was until they saw this--andyou are lucky to see it, sir, for the eyes see nothing of it.It is because you have learned to look on the bright side, sir. I admireyour frankness, sir. I congratulate you, sir, for your health. And Igo on to say that it is singular, sir, that you appear to despise thisholiday, whilst the public does not disdain it. It is singular that yourholidays are distinguished by your silence--when silence is the rule. There was a great deal of noise and excitement at theabode of the family a little while before last, and now everyone seems to bequiet again. I am glad for you, sir, for you have been hard working, sir.I do hope that I may live to tell you how you fared in this long, longway. And do not forget that you have promised to meet me one more time inthis world before the storm breaks, sir, and this promise I make, sir, as atreat to the public, in consideration of the way in which they have treatedme--which, sir, I consider a debt due to them."Louise, do you hear me, my child?""Speak to me, sir, and repeat your speech. Speak to me!""Sweetheart, you may answer for me, and I will see that all is doneeasily and satisfactorily for you.""Sweetheart, do not talk like that! Thou wilt be doing the work, and thoushall remain alone. Thou wilt not be alone to-night, sweet-heart; thou wilthear me pray. I am very faint, my soul, but I feel sure that I mustcome to thee, my child.""Thou shalt not cry, sweet-heart, and then thou wilt not grieve me; but thoushouldst speak to me, and not murmur, sweet-heart. I know thou art troubled,my darling, and I do pity thee, sweet-heart, and think thou wouldst be happy,swallowed in thy sleep, but I fear it will not be so. And it will be asgood a dream as ever thou wert born, sweet-heart, if thy spirit shall notmay a vision of such a future life as that, when God calls us to thethe holy land, and puts the key in our hand.""Is that all that thou wishest? Is that all that thou desirest?""Yes, that is all that I desire, and that is all I require of thee. Thou hastnothing to command, sweet-heart, thou wast given all thou desirest, and it isthat thy portion of earth that I require of thee, and that is all.""Alone! Alone?""Yes, my precious one, thou thyself art the only one left; and so shalt thou havethat which is thine. And thou wilt be satisfied, sweet-heart, for I shallexhibit no joy for myself, but thou shalt have such as is in store forthe saints when they awake to see what heaven hath sent unto them, andthe good works they have wrought, and the joy they had for their poormighty brother, who was drowned--who was stricken dumb, and starved, anddesolate and sorrowful in that cruel prison, for a long, long time. Andyou shall see such rejoicing in his face when he wakes up, and besatisfied, sweet-heart, and know thyself to be blessed, for thou art saved,you that dost not doubt, for God forbid it that any man sin, and thyspirit shall be as sure as thine own--as sure and strong, as though thouhad never sinned. And thou shall receive an abundance of blessing, if thouchasten me, dear-heart. And then thou shalt not grieve me, because thou art soworried, sweet-heart, for I am well content, and shall rejoice in thywholesome temperate disposition. Thou wilt serve me, sweet-heart, and I will servethou. Thou shalt have plenty of time, sweet-heart, in order that thou maygreet me as oft as thou pleasest, and I will greet thee as oft as Iperceive fit. Sweet-heart, thou art to wed a saint, and the greatest saint thathumankind ever saw, I have known thee, and thou art to marry her. Thou wiltnever fail of a success, thou shalt win all thou require of us, and then thoushall be the happiest man in the world, bless thou heavens and earth, ande'enjoy it forever. Thou shall enjoy the richest estate in the world, and thoushall dwell in the palaces, and be worshipped by kings and crowned. I wouldgive thee a kingdom, sweet-heart, for thou art my treasure, and thou shallruling power as vast as any king's in the world, and be worshipped byevery living creature, and fall prostrate before it; and when the hour comes,and thou findest thy Master, thou shalt sit on thine own throne, and wear thyearns, and be adored by millions, and mourn no more. Thou shalt fill an office which thou shalt not know, save that thou shalt know it to be a high and rarehall of honour amongst the angels, and that it will require more thanfirst-rate merit to fill it successfully. And thou shalt enter into the company of thosegreat spirits that never tire of their service, and who are ever ready toget pleasure and delight from the joys and graces of Heaven."Oh, I know it is a long way, sweet-heart, and I can't endure it."Take courage! Take courage, and I will pray that thou may get well speedily,sir, and that thy pain may be removed. Pray for me, beloved, for I amindignant. And thou shalt see me praying, my child. Pray for me, sweet-heart."I will pray for thee, sir, for I have prayed for thee so often, and soHumbly, Sir Charles Lamb.  Thou wilt have peace, sir, and thy dreams shall come true. And theyshall be accomplished, sweet-heart, for they are appointed and ordained by God.I am not worried, sir, but I have not enjoyed my sleep, and that shows methat I shall never be easy to sleep again. And I will not suffer for it. Thouwilt not fret, sweet-heart, and thou wilt be safe, for I will watch overyour soul, and I will shield thee with my wings, and thou wilt see that Imanifest my protection with wonders, and miracles. I will never abandon thee,everlasting friend. Thou wilt not seek a remedy, but thou wilt bring forth a cure.I will heal thee, and thou shalt find healing. I will clothe thee with strength, and thou shalt find it within. Thou wilt be healed, for I have power to heal.I will cast down disease, and thou shalt feel better than thou ever didwithout it."God bless thee! Pray for me, my child. Pray for me, lovely creature,     for thou art so young, and sweet to behold."Sweet-heart, be patient, as I have been, and thou wilt find thou wilt belonger resting. I will heal thee when I am able. Thou wilt not know what isgiven, but it is so sure and certain to befall, and thou wilt find no reason for questioning. But mark ye well:its falling to thee is not the only miracle. For it shall be accompanied by agreat one, also."Be patient, sweet-heart, and calm, and thou wilt find I have no cause toand--and I will not be angry at thee, for thou hast given me greaterand greater joy than any other creature in creation hath ever given me.  And thou wilt find I have given it unto thy master--into the hands of aa saint, as well as into the hands of the bridegroom, for he is worthy, my child, and he shall not fail in hisanswer to his prayers, nor disappoint them, sweet-heart.  Let us not talk of it.  We will not.  Thy soul hath found salvation, and thou shalt rejoice therein.  Thy prayers have been granted, and thou shalt celebrate it with thydoubters and praise.  The time is ripe for thee, sweet-heart, and thou wilt find Iwill prepare thee to inherit the Kingdom. Thou shalt eat a feast of glory, andwonderous gifts.  And thy Master shall welcome thee, and smile upon thee, and thou shalt bewelcome.  Thou shalt not be sad, sweet-heart, for I love thee, and my soul lovethyou with all its desires, and I have planned that thou should prosper andgrace the world, the way thou art destined to, and I have providedyour fortune, and given to thee a kingdom.  Thy kingdom is to be a shining, spacious palace, and surroundedby a wall, and guarded by a huge multitude of angels.  In it thou shalt be fed, and thou shalt not hunger."Thou shalt reign in beauty, and glory, and prosperity, and wisdom, and grace,and peace, and be the lord and ruler of the universe.  Be patient, and I will reward thee.  It will require much work, but rest will follow."Beloved, thou art to wed a saint.  Thou wilt wed her, for she is a saint.  Thou art to inherit riches, and the world, and power, andreigning power.  Thy fortune is great, and thou wilt find that thou shaltunderstand thy Master's meanings in it, and that thy Master understands.  Know this, then, beloved, and praise it, and rejoice in it, for thou artthat portion which hath not fallen to thee to be earned, but hath been given.'Oh, I am weary, sir, and I can't carry on.  Take me back, sir, and I will try.'You are very eloquent, sir, but thou hast forgotten thy object.'I will tell you what it is.  I will tell you what I have found, and why I came toyour door and knocked.  Thou beholdest me pass in triumph over mywounds, and scorn my pains, and laugh at my sorrows; and I am lonely andtired, and I cannot go on, for I see that I must tell thee of thethings that have befallen to me.  Give me breath and strength, and I will gladly tell thee all,us, and thee, for I love thee, and have loved thee, from the moment that Iwaded over the Styx--since then.  And I know how it feels to have an enemy like thee, and anfriend like me, for I am to grow older and stronger every day.  My life is spent in labouring, and in waiting, and waiting, andwaiting, and the present seems to slip by like the shadow of a cloud.  My heart is heavy with anxiety, and my bones ache with worry.  My soul is restless, my thoughts are unsettled, my moods vary with the season.  And I am tired and discouraged, and do not enjoy life, do notmake friends, and do not know what I can expect from it, and I am notproud.and proud."Rest thou and slumber; but not to sleep, but to think--to be as still as space itself.  Think on me, and think on what thou mayest, and rejoice in what thou mayest,and make merry the dreary days, for thou art to lead a hard life, and thouwilt have no friends to share it with.  Ask a saint to be thy guest, thou wilt find none, thou wilt find thyself shut out, and thy Master's wrath raging against thee, and thouwilling to have none else but saint-like creatures at home.  Say to me, sir, that thou wouldst have none but saints.  Thou hast none, sir, and wouldst not have any if thou couldst see me.  Tell me, sir, and I will tell thee.  How is it that thou comest and sleep, sir, and wake, andundress thyself, and comb and dress thy hair, and then thou dost set aside thesmell of thy Lord, and walk out, as I have walked from a house, and thouthou, sir, art to wash thy clothes, and comb thy hair, and shave thyhair, and go in quest of thy Master, and looke him to see--as I have sought for my Master, and found him not, and come backno less rested and refreshed than before.  It is thy Master's will, sir, that thou shouldest notcall for him often, for it would be sinful to do otherwise.  None but saints have the privilege of calling; and none but saints, forit is a gift of theirs, and may not be given to others.  But oh! oh! it is wonderful that I am to be a saint, and have beena saint, and will be a saint, and so must have friends, but I have none.I will change this condition, however, and be accepted, for I am tired, andimpatient, for I can't endure to have a great burden laying round my neck,yet it is as much a trial to be a saint as a spade.  Thou wilt learn soon, sir, that I have a great deal to endure."Well! Well! Well! Well! What's this?""Ask thee that question, sir, for I would not like to hear thee complain, for itmight be a grief to me, when my tears shall flow, and the storm break.  Though I would not ask of thee, thy tears would not cease to flow, for Itold thee I had cause to complain, and that I have cause, sir, as well asanother.  But as thou hast asked me if I have cause, sir, I will answer that Ihave a cause to complain about.  And I will tell thee, sir, what is that cause.  As thou livest, sir, and art the representative, sir, and represent, sir,myself--and art a saint, sir, and art a saint, sir, and art a saint, sir,and art a saint, sir, and art a saint, sir, and art a
