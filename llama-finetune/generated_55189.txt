The coach we were in had a neat hole through its front - a reminiscence of its last trip through this region. The bullet that made it wounded the driver slightly, but he did not mind it much.

The hole was only four inches long. When the coach stopped at the place wherethe "hole" happened to be, and the driver got out for a stretch, the ladyupon whom the bullet passed found herself in an uncommonly uncomfortableposition. The hole allowed her to get through the body of the coach as faras it could be done, but unfortunately it turned her so that she cameout on the other side and lay on top of the seat, which was now full ofnearly two dozen passengers. She was cold, but this was no time to worryabout that. At least she wasn't conscious about it; but she had to stand ona sort of platform that ran along the roof of the coach, and though shedidn't like it very well, she couldn't help standing there. Now came thejoke. One of the drivers put his foot to the brake with the intention ofcruising back down the road until he should find something to do with hislittle passenger, but his foot slipped into the hole; and instead ofdriving back up hill, the coach slid into the ditch and went over on itsside--and then sat right there, looking just as comfortable as if nothinghad ever happened! It took them three hours to extricate her from amongthe luggage, after they had gone several miles through country where theydid not know anything about. They finally reached home again, and allhoped and believed the worst thing was that she had been killed.In the morning a man whose name was Mr. B--, arrived here by stagecoach,and called upon me to tell what became of my poor patient.I began to tell him how she fared, but I presently changed my mind, andsaid:"Well, the best way is to look at things, you see, and say'she'slifeless,' don't you think? You wouldn't take any odds against that, wouldyou?""It's a wonderful thing," said Mr. B-, and added, "This fellow thinks hehasn't got anything better to do than talk about his dead sister."There was some doubt in my mind whether he meant to compliment me ornot; so when I heard that the doctor had come to town and was still withher, I resolved to make a fresh start with the subject. We talked ofdeserters, for a while, and I mentioned one instance--a deserter namedMr. Wigglesworth who went across the continent and lived there two orthree years before the war began.  He wanted money, and said he knew adandyed old gentleman with fifty thousand dollars who might sell him hiswages every day and pay him in cash with interest until the first ofJanuary next. I thought he was crazy; but the doctor said:"I have known people who are crazy enough, too, to buy land for $10,000who never paid half that price afterwards."Now I remembered the great farmer Mr. Hall, with twenty-seven slaves.It seems strange that I hadn't thought of him before, although I supposehe is dead, since he has always been talking about buying a farm in theEast for forty thousand dollars, and making himself rich with it.  Well, Ithink the man is dead, anyway, because he hasn't got any more money thanhis original outlay of thirty-five hundred dollars. His property wasvaluable enough to justify the sale of it for one dollar per acre; and Ibelieve he got less for it than that, or nearly as much.That night I wrote the following letter to the _New York Herald_,'Which appeared in the papers yesterday, under date of October 21st, 1863:'Mr. Editor--I am writing this letter in part for the benefit of thosepeople who expect to die soon, and are thus spared the pain of losingtheir friends before they die.  My friend, Miss Mary Jane Parker, diedlast night--the same night which witnessed the death of my sister--Mrs.Mason.  Her death was the result of being stricken by a severe attack ofan epidemic.  This is news which comes only once in ten thousand days, inthis world. There will be others who shall live to hear that this onewas a woman.But let us try to forget the fact that she was a woman.  A female of thattype will always excite our pity, and inspire us with that emotion thatis so painful to our hearts.  She must have been a good woman, andgreat-hearted; she must have loved deeply; she must have cherisheditself as a sacred trust, and kept it inviolate; she must have looked onwith pride, and without shame, all her life the mirror of a beautifulwomenhood and beauty unblemished, without spot or stain, because she wasinhereditary; she must have borne the burden of responsibility withchasteness and dignity, and with patience and fortitude, and in perfectfidelity to her trust, till the day of judgment dawned, and left herbefore its stern majesty of wrath.  Then, for the second time in tenthousand days she fell under the touch of disease, and her sufferingswere unspeakably grievous.  In the agony of her suffering she prayed, andpoured out her heart-broken sorrows to her God.  If the record were writtenon tablets of fire, and not on parchment of human weakness, these wordsof hers would be found indelible in the memory of men.  Though she diedat twenty-three years old, her life had cost sixteen years.  Let usmourn for her, and let us mourn also for her sister.  We may not knowthat these two lost their own parents early in life; but we have reason toseem them as persons, and to feel sympathies with them for their lot,in spite of their having lost their homes and all the means of support.And yet, perhaps, that is precisely why they suffered.I was just about ready to write another letter to the paper today, when thedoctor telephoned to inquire if I wanted a servant.  My answer was'How many?''It isn't necessary to give your orders.''That sounds wise, but somehow I can't manage it,' I said.  'What do youmean, anyhow?  Why are you trying to teach me to be a servant?''To show you that you can be one.''Have you been one yourself?' 'Oh yes.''Ever worked for wages?''Yes.''When you had to go begging in the street?''Yes--but I'm afraid I haven't told you everything.''I hope not.  What else?''Well, the times were not good, as you know.  And then my brother died.  Asto me personally, that didn't matter, though I was brought up to thegospel of love.  But it did mean I couldn't work, and my mother was goneto her rest.  That was hard.  But it was a comfort to me, too, because itdisallowed me the privilege of making a fool of myself by going andgetting drunk.  That was something that used to tempt me, but I'verelinquished that.  You see, sir, I want my mother to have her rest.  Andmy brother was a good man.  He was fond of me, and gave me money whenI asked for it, and sometimes bought me books--though my education wasby no means complete.  But I didn't care about that.  And then I got sick,one night, and my mother was there and prayed for me.  Do you think it wasall mere fancy, sir?''Doubtful.  Yes, it was all real.  It was a thing to be thankful for.  Thevitals of a person's life aren't all in writing--or even in his mind,if he keeps himself busy with books.  Many people have lives like mine.  Butwe know they are real, and we believe them when we read about them in thepress.  No doubt yours was.  Yes, it was.  I'll bet that you were sickwhen she came.''Ouch!'  I said, 'She came in a dream, and said she would pray for me.''Didn't she say she would?  Did you dream you had heard her say it?' 'No.''Wasn't that what she said?''Yes, I dreamed I heard her say it.''You remember that?''Yes.''And you weren't afraid, were you?''No, and neither was I.''Sure enough.  Go ahead and use your imagination, but you'll notice adifference between dream memories and waking ones.  You can see it plainly,even from here.  How many dreams have you had?  A few?  A dozen?  Two orthree?  Just two?  Not a single one?  All right; so let's put you onstand-by.  I'll turn off the lights, and you can close your eyes.  You see,he won't let anybody near you till he gets the lights back in order.'I don't wonder, now.  I wish I could be there to see this.  It isa comfort to me, and it makes me feel happy, in the midst of my trouble.They used to come into my room at night, and sit by my bed and sing songsfor me, and wipe away my tears, and sing again, and cry, and wipe again,and go on with it till I got tired of crying and didn't need any morewiping.  Their voices have gone, now, but it is comforting to know thatthey were real, and that they are waiting for me.'Now please stop the lights,' I said, 'because I'd rather not have companynow, and you're liable to keep them on longer than I would wish.  I mustunderstand that you are not employed for me; but I hope you can see mytrouble, and will tell me if you don't understand.''Yes, I understand, but I cannot understand a stranger.''Can't you see that I'm a person, and know the difference between strangersand strangers?'  No, I couldn't see that.'Go on, then.  Explain yourself.''There's one kind of sicknesses--sicknesses that affect the head and the brain--which are the seats of reason, and feeling, and volition, and all theothers of that complicated machinery that makes a man live, and goes onwithin him; and then there's another kind of sicknesses that affect theheart, and the lungs, and digestion, and all the rest, and takes awaythe power of speech, and breath, and all the natural powers of the body,and leaves the man helpless and unable to help himself.  Both kinds of sicknessescould cripple the man, they could both leave him blind and dumb and'Are you telling me your trouble is of the former kind, sir?''Yes.  Was it a sudden sickness, sir?''Oh, no.  I've been expecting it for a year.''Is it a fear?  Is it pain?  Does it hurt you?  Can you describe it?''Certainly, sir.  I am in pain inside my breast, and it is sharp and hot,and does not seem to belong to me.''You can imagine that, sir.  You can imagine it, and you can feel it, too."Ouch!"  You will cry, too, if you shut your eyes and hold your breath andthoughtfully picture to yourselves the pain of that kind.'You don't understand, sir.''Let me explain.  The fever breaks down the tissues of the humanbody, and degrades it, and destroys its powers and vitality.  Then theman dies, and so does his race.  And so, too, the man who has been illso many months, and has labored so strenuously under it, and been socareful to save his health, and so careful to avoid catching the fever,and so carefully avoiding contact with anyone who might bring it, will losehis battle before it is fought.  Because he was wise, he knew that hecould not win unless he stood alone and brave--without the sheltering care ofanother, and without the protection of medicines.  So he did not inviteno one within the house.  And he protected himself most effectually, and gotall the medicine he needed, and ate sparingly and saved fatness, and sleptmuch, and kept his mind occupied--keeping his faculties strong--and nevera moment wasted.  The end came.  He went quietly and peacefully, in his sleep,nothing the worse for it, and his whole household grieved at his loss andsentiments of condolence were offered, and accepted.  Yet I notice that noneof the young ladies ever ventured near the beds at night, nor ever said a wordto any of the older boys, and yet they grew up to be quite as strong asthem, and were in no danger of dying, and all the young men, when grown up,and not lacking in strength of limb and frame, and knowing every littledetail of agriculture and the habits of stock, married and reared to abounty of blessings, which had begun to flow upon them before they were born.They had inherited it from the children of that long-dead old widow thatlived there many generations ago--the widow who kept the village shop.  (Ah!) You see, Sir, that's where your trouble lies.Tom, there's a secret about women and their fears.  These dear things havesome of their troubles, and others not.  Some of the latter you can'tmake sense of.  Oh, no; you can't.  They can't be understood anddealt with by common thoughts.'Wherefore, Tom, I can't begin to understand yours.  Could you explain it,I beg of you?''I certainly could, sir--yes--I know I could, for sure.  Look at it for yourhimself.''We shall wait patiently and watchingly for your explanation, Tom.''Look at the circumstances.  Sit up and look; it will be better for you,and for me.  Sit up, Tom.''I can't, sir.''Why?  Will you throw yourself on your pillow and not answer?''No, sir.''Will you lie prone on your bed, not move at all, and eat and drink atonce, and not ask questions or learn anything or improve yourself?''No, sir.''No, you won't.  You won't lift a finger to help yourself; you won'tdo aught; you won't do anything that counts for getting better."Why?  What would happen to you, Tom?  You would waste away?  You woulddie, sooner or later, maybe, or age, and be feeble and lame, and die?  No; you would live long and prosper, and marry, and havegood children, and plenty of fun and society, and the blessing of healthand peace, and every happiness which fortune can bestow?  You would getgood looks and fine proportions?  Yes--pretty fair looks and a fine figure, sir.  You would be well-built, strong, and supple, and agile, and graceful; your voice would rise above the common level, and you would sound fine; your tongue would be swift and clear and free, your articulation would be delicate, and your speech pure and easy-flowing and sweet; your face would be open, frank, and happy, and your teeth white and lovely; you would grow tall and handsome, and fine-looking, and you would get the finest of your family fortunes."'Sir,' says Tom, 'I can't sit up.''Come, Tom, do!''No, sir.'  'Do,' says I, firm and determined.  And do.  You can't stay where youare now; you must get out of that chair and put yourself erect.  You areall wrong--in everything but the outward shape of the case.  Here, Tom;loose the tie at the waist--put it around your neck, and look at it, sir.  Lookagain, and still again--look it steadily all the time, sir, for I tell youit is true--the shape and form of this thing is beautiful, and your handsshould be proud and noble with it, and your arms capable and strong.  Lookagain, sir.  See?  You can sit up in a minute, now, I hope.  You can't walk yet, but you can walk.  Good boy!--let me kiss you!''Goodnight, sir!''Good-night!''Ay, ay, indeed.'CHAPTER XXIV.At this time I was awakened by a noise, and woke up wondering at the loudsound, and thinking that I heard a party coming toward the door.  I startedto dress and button up, and hurry downstairs, but woke the old woman upwithout warning, and sent her upstairs with a message, saying:'Your son has come to die, ma'am; and he has come in a dream.  Ask him if hesaw his mother when he went to visit her in the evening--for he did say he saw her.  Tell her to send him to her.''Who is it, ma'am?''His mother.  She is gone to her rest, ma'am.''Her mother, is it, ma'am?  Has she left her child alone?' 'No, ma'am.  It is cruel to leave a child alone when he is young, but theLord knows he is not lonely, for he sees his mother often, and talkswith her, and sits by her feet at night, and waits, ma'am.'
